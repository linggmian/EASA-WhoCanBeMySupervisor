As everything becomes connected and intelligent, it is driving digital transformation of all industries. However, the IoT brings with it, new security threats because the working IoT applications mechanisms are differ due to the heterogeneity nature of IoT environments. The comprehensive review of the security concerns with regards to the IoT layered architecture, encryption mechanisms, threats, and vulnerabilities is the major contribution of this paper. Furthermore, the IoT security challenges and solutions are emphasized by the layered architecture in order to get a greater understanding and knowledge on the addressing and implementing proper approaches to prevent the recent security threats in IoT on every layer. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Data security; IoT security; IoT security layered architecture; Lightweight block cipher; Lightweight encryption algorithms; Lightweight hash function; Lightweight stream cipher","Architecture; Cryptography; Security of data; Security systems; Digital transformation; IOT applications; Layered architecture; Security challenges; Security threats; Threats and vulnerabilities; Internet of things",,,,,,,"Al-Sarawi, S., Anbar, M., Abdullah, R., Al Hawari, A.B., Internet of Things market analysis forecasts, 2020–2030 (2020) 2020 Fourth World Conference on Smart Trends in Systems, Security and Sustainability (Worlds4), Pp. 449–453, , July; Rekleitis, E., Rizomiliotis, P., Gritzalis, S., A holistic approach to RFID security and privacy (2010) Proceedings of the 1St International Workshop Security of the Internet of Things (Seciot 2010), Network Information and Computer Security Laboratory; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44860-2; Lu, C., (2014) Overview of Security and Privacy Issues in the Internet of Things, , https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse574-14/ftp/security/index.html; Milbourn, T., IP versus Coap for Iot Communications, , https://www.u-blox. com/en/blog/ip-versus-coap-iot-communications, July 2016; Kai, P., DEMO: An IDS framework for internet of things empowered by 6LoWPAN (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security-Ccs 2013, October 2016, Pp. 1337–1340; Ahmad Khan, M., Salah, K., IoT security: Review, blockchain solutions, and open challenges (2018) Future Gener.

Many simulations in VANET develop only message dissemination protocol without considering the safe time needed between moving vehicles and these are rather inaccurate for safety preventions because communications without an effective time gap between vehicles could still lead to collisions. Passenger vehicles avoidance time can be associated with L0-L2 and L3-L5 levels of autonomy, dependent on either human-induced deceleration braking or full automated system braking. Two passenger vehicle avoidance time models have been proposed. The results obtained shows marked differences in the needed avoidance time for safe vehicle braking to avoid a crash. A delay of 4s is suggested to maintain a suitable avoidance time between leading and following vehicles for CAVs in urban and highway roads. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous; Avoidance time; CAV; TGFD; VANET","Accidents; Automation; Autonomous vehicles; Automated systems; Autonomous; Autonomous vehicle technologies; Avoidance time; Message dissemination; Passenger vehicles; TGFD; VANET; Vehicle to vehicle communications",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/650804/M151","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research work is fully funded by a USM research grant (304/PKOMP/650804/M151).","(2018) Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, , W.

While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.","MANET detailed; Mobile Ad hoc Network; real mobility; real-testbed","Budget control; Costs; Grid computing; Remote control; Technology transfer; Testbeds; Algorithms and protocols; Evaluation tool; Low-cost electronics; Low-cost robots; MANET detailed; Manet testbed; Open hardware; Rudimentary structures; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,,,"Lenders, V., Wagner, J., May, M., Analyzing the impact of mobility in ad hoc networks (2006) Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Multi-Hop Ad Hoc Networks: From Theory to Reality, REALMAN '06, pp. 39-46. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Amjad, K., From simulation to testbed: An, indoor MANET performance analysis study (2012) Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC 2012) Loughborough, pp. 1-4; Benmoshe, B., Berliner, E., Dvir, A., Performance monitoring framework for Wi-Fi MANET 2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC 2013), pp. 4463-4468; Cuervo, E., Gilbert, P., Wu, B., Cox, L., CrowdLab: An architecture for volunteer mobile testbeds (2011) 2011 Third International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2011, pp. 1-10; Do, V.T.M., Landmark, L., Kure, O., Testbed-based performance evaluation of a connectionless multicast protocol for MANETs (2014) 2014 11th International Symposium on Wireless Communications Systems (ISWCS 2014), pp. 276-281; Hiyama, M., Kulla, E., Oda, T., Ikeda, M., Barolli, L., Experimental results, of a MANET testbed in a mixed environment considering horizontal and vertical topologies (2012) 2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA 2012), pp. 884-889; Kulla, E., Sakamoto, S., Ikeda, M., Barolli, L., Xhafa, F., Kamo, B., Evaluation of a MANET, testbed for central bridge and V-shape bridge scenarios using BATMAN routing protocol (2013) 2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA 2013), pp. 199-205; Kulla, E., Ikeda, M., Oda, T., Barolli, L., Xhafa, F., Takizawa, M., Multimedia transmissions, over a MANET Testbed: Problems and Issues (2012) 2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS 2012), pp. 141-147; Messeguer, R., Ochoa, S.F., Pino, J.A., Medina, E., Navarro, L., Royo, D., Neyem, A., Building real-World Ad-Hoc networks to support mobile collaborative applications: Lessons learned (2009) Groupware: Design, Implementation, 5784, pp. 1-16. , Use L.

Thus, the main motivation of this paper is to review various techniques that have been used in previously reported research of Peer to Peer (P2P) over Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). From the said document, it is identified that all previously techniques used in P2P over MANET have one similarity; namely maintaining the use of TCP/IP stack as network solution, in which the source for high energy resources for their proposed solution. Hence, this paper proposed a new solution beyond the TCP/IP stack paradigms in order to improve energy efficiency in P2P over MANET, whereby through the use of Content Centric Networking (CCN). In detail, this paper has included conceptual framework of our suggested solution. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two objectives: (i) to present a literature review on the topic of P2P over MANET, and (ii) to provide conceptual framework of our suggested solution. © 2018 IEEE.","MANET;

However, several issues due to the dynamic nature of VANETs disrupt the efficiency of safety message dissemination. Clustering is a common solution applied to overcome VANET challenges. If a Cluster Head is exposed to accidents, it would lose its role and disband the cluster. When re-clustering happens frequently, a greater amount of overhead is produced. This work presents a modified version of the original Safe Clustering Algorithm (M-SCA) whereby safety distance is applied in the cluster maintenance stage to extend the cluster phase. NS2 simulation is conducted to measure the performance of the proposed scheme under QoS parameters, emergency message inter-arrival time, and overhead. © 2017 IEEE.","cluster; safety distance; VANET","Alarm systems; Highway accidents; Vehicular ad hoc networks; cluster; Cluster maintenance; Cooperative collision warning; Emergency messages; Inter-arrival time; Safety distances; Safety message disseminations; VANET; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,"Almalag, M.S., Olariu, S., Weigle, M.C., Tdma cluster-based mac for vanets (tc-mac) (2012) World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2012 IEEE International Symposiumon A, pp. 1-6. , , June IEEE; AlMheiri, S.M., AlQamzi, H.S., MANETs andVANETs clustering algorithms: A survey (2015) GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCCCE), 2015 IEEE 8th, pp. 1-6. , , February IEEE; Aissa, M., Arafah, B., Henchiri, M., Safe Clustering Algorithm in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks; Balon, N., Introduction to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and the BroadcastStorm Problem; Basu, P., Khan, N., Little, T.D., A mobility basedmetric for clustering in mobile ad hoc networks (2001) Distributedcomputing Systems Workshop, 2001 International Conference on, pp. 413-418. , , April IEEE; Cha, S.H., A survey of broadcast protocols for vehicular ad-hocnetworks (2014) SmartCR, 4 (4), pp. 246-255; Fadilah, S.I., Rahman, A., (2006) A Novel Adaptive Time Gap BasedCongestion Control for Vehicular Ad Hoc Network; Fadilah, S.I., Shariff, A.R.M., A time gap intervalfor safe following distance (tgfd) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (vanet) environment (2014) IntelligentSystems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th InternationalConference on, pp. 683-689. , , January IEEE; Goonewardene, R.T., Ali, F.H., Stipidis, E.L.I.A.S., Robust mobility adaptive clustering scheme with support for geographicrouting for vehicular ad hoc networks (2009) IET Intelligent TransportSystems, 3 (2), pp. 148-158; Gupta, N., Prakash, A., Tripathi, R., Adaptive beaconing in mobility aware clustering based mac protocol for safety messagedissemination in vanet (2017) Wireless Communications and MobileComputing, 2017; Jiang, D., Taliwal, V., Meier, A., Holfelder, W., Herrtwich, R., Design of 5.9 GHz DSRC-based vehicular safety communication (2006) IEEEWireless Communications, 13 (5); Khan, A.A., (2015) An Evolutionary Game Theoretic Approach for Stableclustering in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) (Doctoraldissertation); Kuklinski, S., Wolny, G., Density based clustering algorithm for VANETs (2009) Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks &Communities and Workshops, 2009.TridentCom 2009. 5th International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , , April IEEE; Kumar, V., Mishra, S., Chand, N., Applications of VANETs: Present &future (2013) Communications and Network, 5 (1), p. 12; Moustafa, H., Senouci, S.M., Jerbi, M., Introduction tovehicular networks (2009) Vehicular Networks, 1; Najafzadeh, S., Ithnin, N.B., Abd Razak, S., Broadcasting in connected and fragmented vehicular ad hoc networks (2014) InternationalJournal of Vehicular Technology, 2014; Nguyen, V., Kim, O.T.T., Dang, D.N.M., Kim, S.S., Hong, C.S., Application of the lowest-ID algorithm in cluster-basedTDMA system for VANETs (2015) Information Networking (ICOIN), 2015International Conference on, pp. 25-30. , , January IEEE; Rawashdeh, Z.Y., Mahmud, S.M., Media accesstechnique for cluster-based vehicular ad hoc networks (2008) VehicularTechnology Conference, 2008.

In the emerging global economy, e-business has increasingly become a necessary component of business strategy and a strong catalyst for economic development. In near future, vehicles may be equipped with short-range radios capable of communicating with other vehicles and highway infrastructure using a VANET. Mobile Advertisement is a location-aware dissemination solution built on top of a vehicular ad-hoc network. We envision a network of 802.11p that dynamically disseminate data to clients running on the car's smart device. The approach can be considered an alternative to the static advertisement billboards and can be useful to business companies wanting to dynamically advertise their products and offers to people driving their car. The clients can subscribe to information based on specific topics. We present design solutions that use RSU in 802.11p network for transmitting messages to wireless-enabled devices equipped on vehicles. We also present implementation details for the evaluation of the proposed solution using a simulator designed for VANET application. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Advertisements dissemination; CCH utilization; VANET; VCAD",,,,,,,,"(2010) Web gives birth to banner ads, , http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/10/1027hotwired-banner-ads/; (2011) Google annual report, , http://investor.google.com/pdf/2011_google_annual_report.pdf; Batista, P.J., Sacasas, R., Telemarketing and the TCPA: Let the seller beware (2003) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31 (1), pp. 97-98; (2011) IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report-Full Year, , Technical Report April, 2012; Harteinstein, H., Labertaux, K.P., (2010) VANET Vehicular Applications and Inter-Networking Technologies, , John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Mar; Lind, R., (1999) The Network Vehicle-a glimpse into the future of mobile multi-media, , IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 1492732; Abboud, K., Zhuang, W., Modeling and analysis for emergency messaging delay in vehicular ad hoc networks (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE GLOBECOM; Toor, Y., Muhlethaler, P., Laouiti, A., de La Fortelle, A., Vehicle ad hoc networks: applications and related technical issues (2008) IEEE Commun.

Although, these devices have been replaced the traditional wired systems and contribute in solving the high cost of such systems, there are drawbacks been emerged. The major disadvantages are the range limitation of Bluetooth module and the line of sight problem of IrDa device. A ZigBee is low cost and low power consumption wireless technology. It has a higher connectivity range than Bluetooth and doesn’t have line of sight problem. In this paper, an application model using ZigBee wireless remote controlling and data acquisition device as well as the use of internet connection to enable the device to be used worldwide is presented. Such system has several benefits such as portable, long wireless range, low power consumption, low cost and can be used worldwide using internet. The test results show its potential to be implemented in small offices and smart homes. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

The hop-count is derived by identifying the next-hop node that has the minimum distance to the sink node. Meanwhile, the node-degree is obtained through the vehicle ID of each neighbouring nodes in its radius. All the nodes or vehicles in VANETs context were assumed to be equipped with an OnBoard Unit (OBU) that will periodically send beacon messages to other nodes around the transmission range area. From the simulation results, it is found that the HDbR protocol is suitable to be used in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) as it produces high network throughput and minimum end-to-end delay. Thus it is comparable to existing protocol such as AODV when it was evaluated in various speeds scenario. © 2013 IEEE.","hop-count; node-degree; routing protocol; VANETs","Routing protocols; Vehicle transmissions; End to end delay; High network throughput; Hopcount; Neighbouring nodes; node-degree; Transmission ranges; VANETs; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks",,,,,,,"Spaho, E., Barolli, L., Mino, G., Xhafa, F., Kolici, V., Vanet simulators: A survey on mobility and routing protocols (2011) Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), International Conference, pp. 1-10; Shariff, A.R.M., (2007) A Novel Topology Dependent Model for Hop-by-Hop Routing Using Static Metrics, , Ph.
