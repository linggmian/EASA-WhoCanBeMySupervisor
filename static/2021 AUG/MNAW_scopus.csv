They usually have to read printed material using Braille. However, there are limitations for these people when the material is not printed in Braille. Although there is much electronic equipment that can help them to read, the prices are too expensive to afford. Thus, this paper proposes an affordable mobile application which is designed for the visually impaired person. The mobile application is able to capture the image of printed material with a mobile camera. The captured image is then converted to text by using image-to-text conversion in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) framework. Finally, the text will be read out into speech format using text-to-speech conversion in Text to Speech (TTS) framework. As a result, a person who has visual impairment can understand the printed material which is not written in Braille through listening instead of touching. Some alert sound is provided to allow the users to know what exactly happened in the mobile application. It is user friendly for the visually impaired person since the designed system has sound for guideline so they can always get to know the process of the application. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Electronic equipment; Ophthalmology; Optical character recognition; Mobile applications; Optical character recognition (OCR); Printed materials; Text conversion; Text to speech; Text-to-speech conversion; Visual impairment; Visually impaired persons; Mobile computing,,,,,"Universiti Malaysia Perlis

In December 2019, COVID-19 began to appear in a few countries. By the beginning of 2020, it had spread to most countries across the world. This is when education challenges began to arise. The COVID-19 crisis led to the closure of thousands of schools and universities all over the world. Such a situation requires reliance on e-learning and robotics education for students to continue their studies to avoid the mingling between people and students. In relation to this alternative learning solution, the present study was conducted. A systematic literature review on educational robotics (ER) keywords between 2015–2020 was carried out for the purpose to review a total of 2253 articles from the selected sources; Scopus (452), Taylor & Francis (311), Science Direct (427), IEEE Xplore (221), and Web of Science (842). This review procedure was labelled as Taxonomy 1. After filtering Taxonomy 1, it was found that 98 scientific articles formed the so-called Taxonomy II that was categorized into six categories: (i) Robotics concepts, (ii) Device, (iii) Robotic applications, (iv) Manufacturing robots, (v) Robotics analysis, and (vi) Education/taxonomy. For this study, only 35 articles in this specific field were selected, of which were then assigned into three categories: (i) Application, (ii) Platform, and (iii) Educational. The results show that the application category carries 17.4%, platform 20%, and education 22.85%. This study serves as the application platform to help students, academics, and researchers. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

This study explores the implementation of many meta-heuristic algorithms, e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) in multiple motion planning scenarios. The study provides comparison between multiple meta-heuristic approaches against a set of well-known conventional motion planning and navigation techniques such as Dijkstra's Algorithm (DA), Probabilistic Road Map (PRM), Rapidly Random Tree (RRT) and Potential Field (PF). Two experimental environments with difficult to manipulate layouts are used to examine the feasibility of the methods listed. several performance measures such as total travel time, number of collisions, travel distances, energy consumption and displacement errors are considered for assessing feasibility of the motion planning algorithms considered in the study. The results show the competitiveness of meta-heuristic approaches against conventional methods. Dijkstra 's Algorithm (DA) is considered a benchmark solution and Constricted Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) is found performing better than other meta-heuristic approaches in unknown environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Classical; Meta-heuristic; Mobile robot; Navigation; Path planning,Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Motion planning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Robot programming; Robots; Time and motion study; Traffic control; Travel time; Trees (mathematics); Cuckoo search algorithms; Differential Evolution; Experimental environment; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Meta-heuristic methods; Motion planning algorithms; Probabilistic road maps; Heuristic methods,,,,,"University of Salford Manchester, USM

Path planning undoubtedly plays an important role in mobile robot navigation, thus becoming one of the most researched topics in the field of robotics. The metaheuristic algorithms have been extensively studied in recent years to solve the path planning problems the same way as the optimization problems were solved, or in other words, plan the optimum path for the robot to navigate from the starting point to the destination. In this research, a mobile robot is launched to find its path from the starting point to the destination in three different simulated environments using a proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm between Particle Swarm Optimization and Fringe Search Algorithm, named PSOFS, and its simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) capability. During runtime, the path is optimized by considering the path length. The performance of PSOFS for local path planning is compared against two existing algorithms by evaluating the path smoothness as well as robot safety. The results showed that PSOFS has successfully generated shorter, smoother, and safer paths than the algorithms for mobile robot navigation in unknown indoor environments. © 2013 IEEE.",fringe search algorithm; hybrid metaheuristics; Local path planning; mobile robot navigation; particle swarm optimization; unknown indoor environments,Mobile robots; Navigation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Robot programming; SLAM robotics; Dynamic environments; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mobile Robot Navigation; Optimization problems; Path planning problems; Simulated environment; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Indoor positioning systems,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: PELECT/6315298, PKOMP/6315262

Unfortunately, a good access authentication is high in price which had become less affordable. To overcome this scenario, Intelligent Door Locking System is proposed. This system can be divided into 3 parts, which are mobile application, server with web application and microcontroller. The mobile application will be the one in charge of having face recognition process. The face recognition will be carried out using Eigenfaces Algorithm. Users can lock the door using “Normal Lock” mode or “Secure Lock” mode. To unlock the “Normal Lock” mode, user just need to press on unlock button, while to unlock “Se- cure Lock” mode, user would need to pass biometric authentication and passcode authentication process. Once user successfully identified by the mobile application, data will be sent to microcontroller via Bluetooth. At the same time, the microcontroller will retrieve data from server database and check whether the user is having access to enter the room. If yes, the microcontroller will unlock the door. While for the server, it can be easily managed by administration using web application. Users can check their door lock condition from far distance through web application as well. They can lock the door if they realize the door is not locked wherever they are. This bring convenience to the user. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Eigenfaces and smart lock; Face recognition; Intelligent locking system; Security,Authentication; Biometrics; Controllers; Locks (fasteners); Microcontrollers; Mobile computing; Access authentications; Biometric authentication; Eigenfaces; Facial recognition; Intelligent locking system; Mobile applications; Recognition process; Security; Face recognition,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: PKOMP/6315262, PKOMP/8014001

Nowadays, even public transportation such as bus is equipped with video surveillance cameras mainly for monitoring and security purposes. However, they can also be used for other purposes, such as analytics system through passengers counting. This is important to help the bus service provider to improve their fleet management operation by keep tracking of the passenger ridership information. Based on this information, the service provider company can be more flexible with bus scheduling by calculation of lines and stations efficiently. Hence, this paper proposed an analytics system through video footages acquired from daily operation. The incoming and outgoing passengers are tracked based on their head using blob detection and trained MobileNet SSD. The reference line is drawn to make sure that the detected passengers’ head crossed the line before it is considered either as incoming or outgoing passengers. Based on this video analysis, the number of passengers is counted concurrent with the location of the bus. This system is tested in several cases and managed to give proper information for the bus service provider. The data is stored in a cloud database for history, graphically visualize the passenger ridership in a day, month or year. Therefore, this system is able to help the bus company to manage their resource efficiently and consequently improving their service quality and lower the cost of transportation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Analytics system; Blob detection; Fleet management; Passenger ridership; Passengers counting,Bus transportation; Buses; Security systems; Analytics systems; Blob detection; Fleet management; Passenger ridership; Passengers counting; Fleet operations,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM

All of these algorithms have demonstrated their potential to solve many optimization problems. This paper provides an in-depth survey of well-known optimization algorithms. Selected algorithms are briefly explained and compared with each other comprehensively through experiments conducted using thirty well-known benchmark functions. Their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed. A number of statistical tests are then carried out to determine the significant performances. The results indicate the overall advantage of Differential Evolution (DE) and is closely followed by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), compared with other considered approaches. © 2015 Ab Wahab et al.

The biggest challenge for autonomous mobile platform in an unknown environment is the accuracy in the estimation of the distance and the position of obstacles around them. In order for them to safely navigate from one position to another, reliable range sensors are needed to detect any obstacle that blocked their path. Vision sensor can be used for the purpose, as it can provide a better and cost-effective solution. The method discussed in this paper requires a simple calibration. The data obtained from calibration process will be used to generate the equation for depth estimation procedure. The results presented in this paper testify the reliability of the methodology used for depth estimation. © 2012 The Authors.",Depth estimation; Monocular vision; Pixel location; Vision sensor,,,,,,,,,"Salih, Y., Malik, A.S., May, Z., Depth estimation using monocular cues from single image (2011) National Postgraduate Conference (NPC), 2011, pp. 1-4; Chan, P.P.K., Bing-Zhong, J., Ng, W.W.Y., Yeung, D.S., Depth estimation from a single image using defocus cues (2011) 2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC), pp. 1732-1738; Haris, S.M., Zakaria, M.K., Nuawi, M.Z., Depth estimation from monocular vision using image edge complexity (2011) 2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM), pp. 868-873; Jae-Il, J., Yo-Sung, H., Depth map estimation from single-view image using object classification based on Bayesian learning (2010) 3DTVConference: The True Vision - Capture, Transmission and Display of 3D Video (3DTV-CON), 2010, pp. 1-4; Zhao, Y.-G., Cheng, W., Jia, L., Ma, S.-L., The obstacle avoidance and navigation based on stereo vision for mobile robot (2010) 2010 International Conference on Optoelectronics and Image Processing (ICOIP), pp. 565-568; Karaoguz, C., Dankers, A., Rodemann, T., Dunn, M., An analysis of depth estimation within interaction range (2010) 2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 3207-3212; Wahab, M.N.A., Sivadev, N., Sundaraj, K., Development of monocular vision system for depth estimation in mobile robot - Robot soccer (2011) 2011 IEEE Conference on Sustainable Utilization and Development in Engineering and Technology (STUDENT), pp. 36-41; Chen, S.-S., Zuo, W.-H., Feng, Z.-L., Depth estimation via stereo vision using Birchfield's algorithm (2011) 2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN), pp. 403-407; Lijing, Z., Xufeng, L., ASingle Texture Object 3-D Depth Recovery (2010) 2010 Second International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science (ETCS), pp. 684-687; Zhuang, Y., Xu, X., Pan, X., Wang, W., Mobile robot indoor navigation using laser range finder and monocular vision (2003) Robotics, Intelligent Systems and Signal Processing, 2003.

A experiment were made between piezoelectric barium titanate (BT) and piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) to compare between those two crystal type which one is able produce energy more electricity and chosen as piezoelectric microphone material. Element effects such as environmental temperature on system also being consider. The piezoelectric that produce highest output was used as the piezoelectric material and it was directly exposed to acoustic waves. Stresses in the crystals, resulting from a sound field, generate an output proportional to the acoustic pressure. The piezoelectric microphone diaphragm thickness is 1mm. The piezoelectric microphone also was connected to an amplifier system to make sure the output can be seen. However the gain of the amplifier is control by the fuzzy logic controller and the gain of the amplifier range is from 1 to 200. © 2010 IEEE.",Acoustic pressure; BT; Fuzzy logic controller; Piezoelectric microphone; PZT,Acoustic fields; Barium titanate; Computer circuits; Controllers; Lead zirconate titanate; Microphones; Piezoelectric devices; Piezoelectricity; Signal processing; Vibration control; Acoustic pressures; Amplifier systems; Direct current converter; Environmental temperature; Fuzzy logic controllers; Piezoelectric lead zirconate titanates; Piezoelectric microphones; Piezoelectric vibration control; Fuzzy logic,,,,,,,,"Johnston, D., Scott gibsongreen from the ground up (2008) Sustainable, Healthy, and Energy-Efficient; Boyle, G., (2004) Renewable Energy; Vives, A.A., (2008) Piezoelectric Transducers and Applications; Khazan, A.D., (1994) Transducers and Their Elements, , Prentice Hall; Ko, S.C., Kim, Y.C., Lee, S.S., Choi, S.H., Kim, S.R., Micromachined piezoelectric membrane acoustic device (2003) Sensors and Actuators","Halim, M.
