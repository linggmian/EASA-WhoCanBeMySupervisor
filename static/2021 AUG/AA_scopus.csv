The exergames may provide enjoyable experiences that could motivate people to participate and continue playing the game play, while also exercising at the same time. Methods: This article presents a treasure hunt-based walking exergames on android platform with the implementation of intelligence-based image recognition. The exergame, termed USM ExerHunt uses images of Universiti Sains Malaysia buildings as the hints. The participant of the game supposes to find a building shown in the hint, and once reaching the destination captures the image of the building. Then, the application will calculate the total steps taken and calories burnt by the participant using an implementation of accelerometer from the mobile phone. Results: The developed USM ExerHunt application is able to achieve accurate image recognition of USM building, with the accuracy rate of 92%. Besides that, the application is capable of calculating the number of total steps and calories burnt after an exercise routine is completed. Conclusion: This android application has shown a proof of concept in incorporating machine intelligence into an exergame application, with pilot study within the USM community. © 2019 UPM Press.

A comparative study of two different sinogram interpolation methods for metal artefact reduction in CT images is presented. The metal part of the sinogram was determined and removed by thresholding technique. The missing part of the metal trace on the sinogram was interpolated by two interpolation methods which were cubic spline and Laplace interpolation. Both methods were applied to the selected CT images of different metal geometry and complexity. The effectiveness of both interpolation methods was compared. The results showed Laplace interpolation method produced the better results of gap filling as compared to cubic spline interpolation. But, it produces lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. © 2018 IEEE",Computed tomography; Metal artefact reduction; Sinogram interpolation,Biomedical engineering; Computerized tomography; Laplace transforms; Metals; Signal to noise ratio; Splines; Trace elements; Comparative studies; Cubic-spline interpolation; Interpolation method; Laplace interpolation; Metal artefacts; Metal geometry; Sinograms; Thresholding techniques; Interpolation,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/CIPPT/ 811344,This research was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under the Research University (RUI) Grant (1001/CIPPT/ 811344).,"Barret, J.F., Keat, N., Artefacts in CT: Recognition and Avoidance (2004) RadioGraphics, 24, pp. 1679-1691; Boas, F.E., Fleischmann, D., Evaluation of Two Iterative Techniques for Reducing Metal Artifacts in Computed Tomography (2011) Radiology, 259 (3), pp. 894-902; Gjesteby, L., Man, B.D., Jin, Y., Paganetti, H., Verburg, J., Giantsoudi, D., Wang, G., Metal Artifact Reduction in CT: Where Are We After Four Decades?

In brain MR images, the hippocampus is observed as a gray matter structure that often exhibits very weak or unclear boundary definitions at some fragments of its’ boundary. The unclear boundaries even cause the medical experts to misjudge the hippocampus boundary, especially at the head and tail. In this research, an automated segmentation approach, termed as Assembled and Weighted Coherent Point Drift is investigated to delineate the hippocampus accurately. Evaluations on public datasets produced an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.8050, which appears better, in comparison to several other hippocampus segmentation approaches, especially against the well-known software program called Freesurfer. The study also revealed that the accuracy of the proposed segmentation approach seems on par with other various state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019",Brain structures; Level set; Registration; Segmentation,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/CIPPT/6315060,This work was supported by a Short Term Grant awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia (304/CIPPT/6315060).,"Achuthan, A., Rajeswari, M., Hippocampus segmentation using locally weighted prior-based level set (2015) Proceeding of SPIE: 7th International Conference on Graphic and Image Processing (ICGIP 2015); (1998), pp. 415-421. , Amenta, Nina, Bern, Marshall, Kamvysselis, Manolis, 1998.

These three planes are integrated as the input streams for the Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet). The main objective of including the input patches from triplanar views is to enrich the ConvNet with more context information to aid in the classification of liver tumor. The input patches are extracted from liver Computed Tomography (CT) dataset using center pixel of interests from the triplanar views. These patches are fed into the proposed Triplanar ConvNet. Pilot experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of using triplanar views in comparisons with single-view from axial plane. The preliminary results achieved in this study revealed that triplanar approach yield better results than using patches only from single-view. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Convolutional neural network; Liver tumor segmentation; Triplanar,Classification (of information); Computer vision; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Neural networks; Robotics; Context information; Convolutional neural network; Coronal planes; Liver tumor segmentations; Pilot experiment; Pilot studies; Pixel of interests; Triplanar; Tumors,,,,,,,"Lecun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition (1998) Proc.

Lack of a distinct image attributes that separate adjacent structures often hinders the accuracy of the segmentation. Therefore, researches have been directed to infer prior knowledge about the possible shape and spatial location to promote accurate segmentation. Realizing the importance of prior information, this focused review aims to introduce brain structures segmentation from the perspective of how the prior information has been utilized in the segmentation methods. A critical analysis on the methodology of the brain segmentation approaches, its’ advantages and issues pertaining to these methods has been discussed in detail. This review also provides an insight to the current happenings and future directions in brain structure segmentation. © 2018 UPM Press.

The intensity similarity has causes the hippocampus to have weak or fuzzy boundaries. With this main challenge being demonstrated by hippocampus, a segmentation method that relies on image information alone may not produce accurate segmentation results. Therefore, it is needed an assimilation of prior information such as shape and spatial information into existing segmentation method to produce the expected segmentation. Previous studies has widely integrated prior information into segmentation methods. However, the prior information has been utilized through a global manner integration, and this does not reflect the real scenario during clinical delineation. Therefore, in this paper, a locally integrated prior information into a level set model is presented. This work utilizes a mean shape model to provide automatic initialization for level set evolution, and has been integrated as prior information into the level set model. The local integration of edge based information and prior information has been implemented through an edge weighting map that decides at voxel level which information need to be observed during a level set evolution. The edge weighting map shows which corresponding voxels having sufficient edge information. Experiments shows that the proposed integration of prior information locally into a conventional edge-based level set model, known as geodesic active contour has shown improvement of 9% in averaged Dice coefficient. © 2015 SPIE.",Geodesic active contour; Hippocampus segmentation; Level set; Locally weighted,Geodesy; Image processing; Integration; Medical imaging; Automatic initialization; Geodesic Active Contour; Hippocampus segmentation; Imaging characteristics; Level Set; Locally weighted; Segmentation results; Spatial informations; Image segmentation,,,,,"FP7 Research Potential of Convergence Regions

The concept of assembled point set is introduced, which is a combination of the available training point sets into a single data space that represents its distribution. Non-rigid Coherent Point Drift is then adapted to register the assembled point set with a randomly chosen base model for hippocampus localization. The primary focus of this work is on the computational intensiveness of the localization approach, in which the proposed localization approach using assembled point set is compared with an existing groupwise non-rigid Coherent Point Drift (GCPD) approach. The computation intensiveness of the proposed approach grows at a quadratic rate as compared with GCPD that grows at a cubic rate. The proposed approach is validated with hippocampus localization task using 40-datasets.

In this work, we adapt a feature computed from wavelet transform called wavelet energy to represent the region information. The wavelet energy is embedded into a level set model to formulate the segmentation model called wavelet energy-guided level set-based active contour (WELSAC). The WELSAC model is evaluated using several synthetic and CT images focusing on tumour cases, which contain regions demonstrating the characteristics of intra-region intensity variations and having high similarity in intensity distributions with the adjacent regions. The obtained results show that the proposed WELSAC model is able to segment regions of interest in close correspondence with the manual delineation provided by the medical experts and to provide a solution for tumour detection. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Level set; Medical image segmentation; Wavelet,"Active contours; Computed Tomography; CT Image; Intensity distribution; Intensity variations; Level Set; Level-set model; Medical experts; Medical image segmentation; Region information; Regions of interest; Segmentation methods; Tumour detection; Wavelet energy; Computerized tomography; Digital image storage; Medical imaging; Tumors; Wavelet transforms; Image segmentation; article; bladder tumor; body regions; computer assisted tomography; computer model; controlled study; histogram; human; image analysis; level set based active contour model; priority journal; wavelet energy guided level set based active contour model; algorithm; bladder tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; normal distribution; pathology; procedures; radiography; sensitivity and specificity; thyroid tumor; Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Normal Distribution; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thyroid Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Normal Distribution; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thyroid Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",,,,,"1001/PKOMP/817001

This feature is integrated to formulate a new level set based active contour model that addresses the segmentation of regions with highly similar intensities in medical images, which do not have clear boundaries between them. In the first phase of this research, the strength of wavelet transform is adapted to formulate a statistical feature, named as wavelet energy. The second phase of this work is dedicated to formulate a new level set based active contour model that is suitable for segmenting regions without clear boundaries and exhibits intensity inhomogeneity within the region. The proposed segmentation method is named wavelet energy guided level set based active contour. Experiments are conducted using medical images focusing on the neck and bladder regions to validate the proposed method.

In this paper, a novel problem specific segmentation method is proposed to detect secondary structures in medical images incorporating wavelet transform and watershed transformation. The proposed method consists of 5 stages: wavelet transformation, inter scale linking, feature calculation and clustering, morphological processing and watershed transformation.
