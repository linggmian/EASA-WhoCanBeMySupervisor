One effort to develop an early warning system is to use a forest fire hazard index as a potential assessment guide. The main factor which is a parameter in the fire hazard index calculation method is the meteorological parameter. In general, to know today's fire hazard index is calculated from today's weather conditions, but the need for an early warning system is to know the future fire hazard index. Based on a series of meteorological conditions data held for thirty-six months, using the backpropagation algorithm, it is estimated that the meteorological conditions will be several months to come. Several meteorological parameters have their respective roles, the unknown contribution of which is calculated. In this study, each parameter will be measured by predicting time series data and compared with the results of calculations. The method of calculating the forest fire index used is the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index with the meteorological parameter elements are temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and drought factor. Each parameter was trained in artificial neural networks and tested its predictions to produce accuracy for data series temperatures of 91.67%, the relative humidity of 83.33%, and wind speed of 50%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Backpropagation; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series; Wind; Data series; Early Warning System; Forest fires; Hazard indices; Mcarthur forest fire danger indices; Meteorological condition; Meteorological parameters; Time-series data; Fires",,,,,,,,"Field, R.

However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing. The proposed approach outperforms with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.47 as compared to the highest scoring DBSCAN based method with MAE 27.03. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Citizen security; crime prediction; safe city; smart cities","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Forecasting; Hierarchical clustering; Safety engineering; Smart city; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Mean absolute error; Prediction model; Resource management; Safety and securities; Temporal information; Urban population; Predictive analytics",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1","Corresponding authors: Umair Muneer Butt (umair@student.usm.my), Sukumar Letchmunan (sukumar@usm.my), and Fadratul Hafinaz Hassan (fadratul@usm.my) This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1, and in part by the School of Computer Sciences USM.",,"Spencer, N., Butler, D., Cities: The century of the city (2010) Nature, 467 (7318), pp. 900-901; Cicirelli, F., Guerrieri, A., Spezzano, G., Vinci, A., An edge-based platform for dynamic smart city applications (2017) Future Gener.

In the previous work, we have confirmed that corridor with less than 90° turning angle has negative impact to the pedestrians walking behaviour due to the tendency of the pedestrians to slow down their motion when approaching the turning of the corridor. This restrict the flow of walkers during high-density situation and cause congestion near that turning of the corridor. In this contribution, empirical data collected from previous experimental work is utilised to further study the effect of turning angle on the evacuation behaviour. The simulations of walking through angled-corridor were reproduced which reflects evacuation scenarios. Three different types of angled-corridor are taken into consideration (a 60°-, a 90°-, and a 135°-angled-corridors) with different sets of number of pedestrians (NOP: 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100). Three metrics of evacuation behaviour measurement are reported: (1) inflexion points, (2) escape time, and (3) interaction force. Inflexion point is used to evaluate the restriction flow occurred during the evacuation. From the results, the 60° angled-corridor contained the highest number of inflexion points. With the highest number of inflexion points, the escape time for the 60° angled-corridor is 14.8% to 24% longer compared to the other two types of angled-corridors. This shows that this kind of angled-corridor need to be avoided in the future design of walkways. On top of that, the 60° angled-corridor also gives the maximum interaction force with 213.75 N. This reconfirmed that the corridor with less than 90° turning angle is not suitable to be built as a walkway. This work is relevant to be studied due to its immediate applications in assessment of crowd safety for building egress. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PAWAM/60313040","The authors would like to thank the sponsorship of this study, Universiti Sains Malaysia, under Short Term Grant 2016 (304/PAWAM/60313040).",,"Rahman, N.A., Alias, N.A., Sukor, N.S.A., Halim, H., Gotoh, H., Hassan, F.H., (2019) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 572, p. 012114; Shiwakoti, N., Sarvi, M., Rose, G., Burd, M., (2011) Transportation Research Record, 2234, pp. 97-104; Dias, C., Sarvi, M., Shiwakoti, N., Burd, M., (2012) Transportation Research Record, 2312, pp. 120-127; Gotoh, H., Harada, E., Andoh, E., (2012) Safety Science, 50, pp. 326-332; Harada, E., Gotoh, H., Rahman, N.B.A., (2015) Safety Science, 79, pp. 105-115; Rahman, N.A., Abustan, M.S., Mat, N.C., Gotoh, H., Harada, E., (2015) Applied Mechanics & Materials, 802; Langston, P.A., Masling, R., Asmar, B.N., (2006) Safety Science, 44, pp. 395-417; Smith, R.A., Lim, L.B., (1995) Safety Science, 18, pp. 329-335","Rahman, N.A.; School of Civil Engineering, Malaysia; email: celindarahman@usm.my","Sandu A.V.Abdullah M.M.A.B.Vizureanu P.Ghazali C.M.R.Sandu I.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","2020 EUROINVENT International Conference on Innovative Research, ICIR 2020","21 May 2020 through 23 May 2020",,161805,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Rising earth temperatures add to the higher potential contribution of forest fires. Many forest fire hazard index calculation methods have been developed to analyze the impact categories arising from changes in meteorological parameters. Each calculation method has advantages in calculating the magnitude of the potential. One method of calculating the forest fire hazard index is needed from many choices of methods that have the highest level of accuracy to predict the potential for a fire. A comparative study of the methods will be validated and guide the best calculating procedure to be implemented for the prediction. Predictions that have excellent accuracy and precision can be used as an early warning system. This study will predict forest fires for each calculation method using the Backpropagation algorithm, then analyze the accuracy of the prediction results using Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC). The methods compared include the methods that have been used in Indonesia as a country that has tropical rainforests, namely Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (MFFDI), and Fire Weather Index (FWI). Through a comparative study of this calculation model, it is concluded that MFFDI is the best method of calculating the fire hazard index with an accuracy value of 0.917 and a precision value of 0.667. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The authors were unable to find a comprehensive study on crime hotspot detection and prediction while conducting this SLR. Therefore, to the best of author's knowledge, this study is the premier attempt to critically analyze the existing literature along with presenting potential challenges faced by current crime hotspot detection and prediction systems. The SLR is conducted by thoroughly consulting top five scientific databases (such as IEEE, Science Direct, Springer, Scopus, and ACM), and synthesized 49 different studies on crime hotspot detection and prediction after critical review. This study unfolds the following major aspects: 1) the impact of data mining and machine learning approaches, especially clustering techniques in crime hotspot detection; 2) the utility of time series analysis techniques and deep learning techniques in crime trend prediction; 3) the inclusion of spatial and temporal information in crime datasets making the crime prediction systems more accurate and reliable; 4) the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art techniques and the future research directions. Moreover, the SLR aims to provide a core foundation for the research on spatiooral crime prediction applications while highlighting several challenges related to the accuracy of crime hotspot detection and prediction applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Path planning undoubtedly plays an important role in mobile robot navigation, thus becoming one of the most researched topics in the field of robotics. The metaheuristic algorithms have been extensively studied in recent years to solve the path planning problems the same way as the optimization problems were solved, or in other words, plan the optimum path for the robot to navigate from the starting point to the destination. In this research, a mobile robot is launched to find its path from the starting point to the destination in three different simulated environments using a proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm between Particle Swarm Optimization and Fringe Search Algorithm, named PSOFS, and its simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) capability. During runtime, the path is optimized by considering the path length. The performance of PSOFS for local path planning is compared against two existing algorithms by evaluating the path smoothness as well as robot safety. The results showed that PSOFS has successfully generated shorter, smoother, and safer paths than the algorithms for mobile robot navigation in unknown indoor environments. © 2013 IEEE.","fringe search algorithm; hybrid metaheuristics; Local path planning; mobile robot navigation; particle swarm optimization; unknown indoor environments","Mobile robots; Navigation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Robot programming; SLAM robotics; Dynamic environments; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mobile Robot Navigation; Optimization problems; Path planning problems; Simulated environment; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Indoor positioning systems",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: PELECT/6315298, PKOMP/6315262

In recent years, the growth of digital libraries and video databases makes it more challenging and important to extract useful information from raw data to prevent and detect the crimes from the database automatically. Street crime snatching and theft detection is the major challenge in video mining. The main target is to select features/objects which usually occurs at the time of snatching. The number of moving targets imitates the performance, speed and amount of motion in the anomalous video. The dataset used in this paper is Snatch 101; the videos in the dataset are further divided into frames. The frames are labelled and segmented for training. We applied the VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network architecture algorithm and extracted the features of objects and compared them with original video features and objects. The main contribution of our research is to create frames from the videos and then label the objects. The objects are selected from frames where we can detect anomalous activities. The proposed system is never used before for crime prediction, and it is computationally efficient and effective as compared to state-of-the-art systems. The proposed system outperformed with 81 % accuracy as compared to stateof-the-art systems. © Science and Information Organization.","AlexNet; Anomalous detection; ConvoNet; Surveillance video; VGG16; VGG19",,,,,,,,,"Manjunath, T., Hegadi, R.S., Ravikumar, G., A survey on multimedia data mining and its relevance today (2010) IJCSNS, 10 (11), pp. 165-170; Mabrouk, A.B., Zagrouba, E., Abnormal behavior recognition for intelligent video surveillance systems: A review (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 480-491; Chen, X., Zhang, C., An interactive semantic video mining and retrieval platform-application in transportation surveillance video for incident detection (2006) Data Mining, 2006.

Rationally, there will be changes to the pedestrian walking behavior when approaching and walking through angled-corridor due to the turning angle. This could trigger restrictions to the flow of walkers and causing congestion near that turning angle. Hence, this study is purposely to investigate empirically the characteristics of pedestrians when walking through different angled-corridors (60°, 90° and 135°). Controlled experiment of pedestrians walking through built angled-corridors was conducted at the Multipurpose Hall of USM, involving 60 local undergraduate students. Thirty walking tasks were performed by considering different number of pedestrians (NOP: 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60). Video-based tracking of pedestrian's trajectories walking through angled-corridors was performed and effects on walking characteristics and velocity were discussed. It is found that, pedestrian not necessarily choose the shortest path while walking, but prefer to occupy all space available to suit their own speed and comfort. As the degree of corridor increases, the impacts to pedestrian walking velocity become less. However, in response to the increase in number of pedestrians, the development of changing track can be witnessed. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Controlled experiment; Pedestrian dynamics; Turning angles; Undergraduate students; Video-based tracking; Walking behavior; Walking through; Walking velocity; Students",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PAWAM/60313040","The authors would like to thank the sponsorship of this study, Universiti Sains Malaysia, under Short Term Grant 2016 (304/PAWAM/60313040).",,"Guo, R.Y., (2012) Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 21 (1), pp. 103-113; Aghabayk, K., (2015) Transportation Research Record, 2490 (1), pp. 76-83; Liao, W., (2014) Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 26-33; Zhang, J., (2014) Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 51-59; Liu, X.D., (2014) Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 34-42; Seyfried, A., (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 395-406; Tobias, K., (2006) Theory and Experiment, 10, p. 10014; Ye, R., (2019) Theory and Experiment, 4, p. 043401; Gaire, N., (2017) Journal of Accessibility and Design for All, 7, pp. 56-75; Shiwakoti, N., (2015) 37th Australasian Transport Research Forum (ATRF), 1; Dias, C., (2012) Transportation Research Record, 2312 (1), pp. 120-127; Dias, C., (2014) Transportation Research Record, 2421 (1), pp. 41-50; Dias, C., (2014) Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 19-25; Gorrini, A., (2013) Transportation Research Record, 1, pp. 1-10; (1984), Uniform Building By-Laws (Malaysia: International Law Book Services) [G.

Nowadays, the efficiency of the evacuation process had become one of the issues during emergency incidents due to the difficulties faced by the pedestrians to access the exit points and the formation of clogging region near to the exit points and narrow pathways. Hence, the simulation of the pedestrian evacuation had been introduced as the potential solution exploration by imitating the emergency situations for predicting the survival rate and the casualties of the pedestrians involved. The pedestrian movement in the simulation will construct the movement patterns that are able to assist the development of the emergency route plan for guiding the pedestrians to find the nearest exit to escape. However, the route plan designed based on the ordinary pedestrian movement simulation will highlight the nearest exit instead of the optimal safest exit for the pedestrian to evacuate safely. Hence, to design a low-risk exit selection, this research had made a survey on three existing algorithms to optimize the exit selection process; multi-agent based algorithm, least effort algorithm and game theory algorithm. The experiments were conducted with three different structural layouts (number of doors) with variety number of dataset (number of pedestrians). The result of this research had shown that the game theory algorithm was able to assist the pedestrian movement towards the optimal nearest and safest exit for evacuation process and capable to enhance the simulation for designing a feasible emergency route plan to reduce casualties. ©BEIESP.","Evacuation route plan; Exit selection; Optimization; Pedestrian movement",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: PKOMP.8014073","Research experiments reported were pursued under the Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [304.PKOMP.6316019], Research University Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001.PKOMP.8014073] and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia [203.PKOMP.6711534] and [203.PKOMP.6711713].",,"Muhamading, M., About 6,000 premises destroyed by fire annually in Malaysia (2016) News Straits Times; Stevens, E., Doshi, V., Stampede at Indian train station kills at least 22 (2017) Washington, D.C, , in The Washington Post, ed., USA: The Washington Post; Jay, B.N., Tahfiz did not have fire exit; bodies found piled on top of each other (2017) New Straits Times, Ed.

During panic situation, the survival rate of the pedestrians are depends on the several parameter values that are hard to discover due to the catastrophic case scenarios and almost impossible for the scene to be created due to the human ethical conduct. Hence, with the advance of computation technique and the improvement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) process automation, the panic situations are able to be visualized with the computer simulation. However, based on the previous simulation researches, there are a lot of features that had been found that are able to influence the pedestrian movement and caused the clogging region on the spatial layout. Hence, this research has been conducted to justify and analyze the findings of influential features by simulating the near-realistic pedestrian movement using Cellular Automata (CA) approach to re-enact the real behavioral actions of the pedestrians during panic situation. Based on the near-realistic simulation and the construction of the spatial layout design based on the features that promotes the clogging region experiments, the results had shown that the structural arrangement of a space is the proper solution to increase the pedestrian survival rate and decrease the clogging region. However, the existing structural also can enhance the safety quality of the space by rearranging the obstacles in the spatial layout. This research had introduced the granularity based approach and proves that the implementation of the fine-grain obstacles' arrangement while accommodating the interior design standard may reduce the time (10 seconds, 0.1%) taken for evacuation process and increase the probability of movement directions for the pedestrians to ensure the balance usage of the egress points. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Computation techniques; Evacuation process; Pedestrian movement; Process automation; Realistic simulation; Simulation research; Structural arrangement; Survival prediction; Architectural design",,,,,,"Research experiments reported were pursued under the Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [304.PKOMP.6316019], Research University Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001.PKOMP.8014073] and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia [203.PKOMP.6711534] and [203.PKOMP.6711713].",,"Four in a Family Killed in Fire (2017) The Star Online, , ROC 10894D; Lu, X., Luh, P.B., Tucker, A., Gifford, T., Astur, R.S., Olderman, N., Impacts of Anxiety in Building Fire and Smoke Evacuation: Modeling and Validation (2017) IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2 (1), pp. 255-260; Henderson, B., Graham, C., (2017) The Telegraph, , (Unted Kingdom: Telegraph Media Group Limited) Dubai Skyscraper Fire: Torch Tower Residents Wake to Screams as Flames Engulf 79-Storey Building 2017; Jay, B.N., Tahfiz did not have fire exit; Bodies found piled on top of each other (2017) New Straits Times, , (Malaysia: New Straits Times Press (M) Berhad); Zong, X., Jiang, Y., Pedestrian-vehicle mixed evacuation model based on multi-particle swarm optimization (2016) 2016 11th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE), pp. 568-572; Konstantara, K., Dourvas, N.I., Georgoudas, I.G., Sirakoulis, G.C., Parallel Implementation of a Cellular Automata-Based Model for Simulating Assisted Evacuation of Elderly People (2016) 2016 24th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing (PDP), pp. 702-709; Ruiz, S., Hernández, B., A Parallel Solver for Markov Decision Process in Crowd Simulations (2015) 2015 Fourteenth Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI), pp. 107-116; Hall, J.R., (2011) High-Rise Building Fires, , (Quincy, USA: National Fire Protection Association); Yan, Z., Han, X., Li, M., Accurate Assessment of RSET for Building Fire Based on Engineering Calculation and Numerical Simulation (2016) MATEC Web of Conferences, p. 04024; Huixian, J., Shaoping, Z., Navigation system design of fire disaster evacuation path in buildings based on mobile terminals (2016) 2016 11th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE), pp. 327-331; Xueling, J., Simulation Model of Pedestrian Evacuation in High-Rise Building: Considering Group Behaviors and Real-Time Fire (2015) International Journal of Smart Home, 9 (2), p. 81. , 8192; Chen, Y., Cai, Y., Li, P., Zhang, G., Study on Evacuation Evaluation in Subway Fire Based on Pedestrian Simulation Technology (2015) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2015, p. 9. , 2015; Sime, J.D., Crowd psychology and engineering (1995) Safety Science, 21 (1), pp. 1-14; Tcheukam, A., Djehiche, B., Tembine, H., Evacuation of multi-level building: Design, control and strategic flow (2016) 2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC); Wang, H., Simulation research based on evacuation ability estimation method (2016) 2016 12th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA), pp. 645-649; Hassan, F.H., Using microscopic pedestrian simulation statistics to find clogging regions (2016) 2016 SAI Computing Conference (SAI), pp. 156-160; Miao, Q., Lv, Y., Zhu, F., A cellular automata based evacuation model on GPU platform (2012) 2012 15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 764-768; Helbing, D., Johansson, A., (2009) Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science, pp. 1-28. , Helbing D. and Johansson A. ed R.

The implementation of machine learning approaches in flood prediction may reduce all the risk factors. Machine learning is one of the method that provide better performances and it is cost-effective and recently used among hydrologists. However, the capability of each machine learning algorithm is different for each type of tasks which is called generalization problem. Thus, for this research, three machine learning methods which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) is chosen for flood prediction model. Each of machine learning algorithms are built and trained in order for they to work accordingly with two different datasets. The aim of this research project is to investigate the performance of three selected machine learning algorithms and compared their accuracy.

In this case, high temperatures in the dry season can cause an increase in drought index that could potentially burn the forest every time. Thus, the government should conduct surveillance throughout the dry season. Continuous surveillance without the focus on a particular time becomes ineffective and inefficient because of preventive measures carried out without the knowledge of potential fire risk. Based on the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), formulation of Drought Factor is used just for calculating the drought today based on current weather conditions, and yesterday's drought index. However, to find out the factors of drought a day after, the data is needed about the weather. Therefore, we need an algorithm that can predict the dryness factor. So, the most significant fire potential can be predicted during the dry season. Moreover, daily prediction of the dry season is needed each day to conduct the best action then a qualified preventive measure can be carried out. The method used in this study is the backpropagation algorithm which has functions for calculating, testing and training the drought factors. By using empirical data, some data are trained and then tested until it can be concluded that 100% of the data already well recognized. Furthermore, some other data tested without training, then the result is 60% of the data match. In general, this algorithm shows promising results and can be applied more to complete several variables supporters. © 2019 University of Baghdad.

One of the features in the CA movement model is to find the shortest path distance that will navigate the pedestrian movement towards point of interest in the fastest of time. Nowadays, there are many path navigation systems that were constructed by using the pre-defined movement simulation based on the static obstacles’ layout. However, the pre-defined movement simulation is not able to highlight the near-realistic movement of the pedestrian due to the dynamic obstacle’s avoidance and physical collision that will affect the pedestrian movement direction’s selection and safety. Hence, this research has simulated the enhanced transition direction of the CA based pedestrian movement using the optimal Moore Neighborhood transition method and has proposed the Pythagorean Theorem for the shortest distance path finding for assisting the pedestrian direction selection. This research has proven that the enhanced movement transition direction and the implementation of Pythagorean Theorem able to construct an intelligent and near-realistic pedestrian simulation that able to evacuate in fastest time (<25 s) from the selected spatial layout design compared to the transition method based pedestrian movement simulation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Cellular automata; Moore neighborhood transition; Pedestrian movement; Pythagorean theorem; Shortest distance","Air navigation; Cellular automata; Computer vision; Navigation systems; Robotics; Robots; Direction selection; Microscopic movements; Movement Simulation; Pedestrian movement; Pedestrian simulation; Pythagorean theorem; Shortest distance; Shortest distance paths; Pedestrian safety",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: 203.PKOMP.6711534

Hence, this research is to simulate the pedestrian movement to find the impact of building’s familiarity and space design towards the pedestrian movement speed. The familiarity of the pedestrian had been tested with the horizontal movement of Von Neumann approach and optimal criterion of Moore Neighborhood approach for a closed building area with the randomization of spatial layout obstacles arrangement. The optimal Moore Neighborhood is able to re-enact the real behavior of the pedestrian with high familiarization. Hence, this research had proven that the pedestrian with high familiarity of a building escape route had moved faster with higher speed. The pedestrian movement speed was improved with the feasible spatial layout design of the closed area building that is able to shape the flow of the pedestrian’s movement and reduce the physical collision. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Cellular automata; Closed area building; Moore neighborhood; Pedestrian movement; Spatial layout design; Von neumann","Architectural design; Cellular automata; Intelligent computing; Building areas; Dangerous structures; Escape route; Horizontal movements; Neumann; Optimal criteria; Pedestrian movement; Spatial layout; Structural design",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304.PKOMP.6313169, 304.PKOMP.6316019","Research experiment reported here is pursued under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia for “Enhancing Genetic Algorithm for Spatial Layout Design Optimization with Pedestrian Simulation in a Panic Situation” [203.PKOMP.6711534] and Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia for “Pedestrian Simulation Model for Clogging Detection and Survival Prediction in a Fire Spreading Situation” [304.PKOMP.6316019].

The available spatial layout design applications had focused on the structural and functional demands for a trendy, cultural influences and scalable spatial design. The previous research on the autonomous spatial layout design had proved that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with full-fledged of operators are able to design an optimal spatial layout that is scalable for the space utilization. However, in these recent years, due to many occurrences of emergency incidents, the security assurance of the pedestrian to evacuate from the spatial layout during panic situation had become the main focus in designing a spatial layout.

Backpropagation method was used for the counter measure and prediction analysis of the epidemic disease. The predictive analysis based on the backpropagation method can be determine via machine learning process that promotes the artificial intelligent in pattern recognition, statistics and features selection. This computational learning process will be integrated with data mining by measuring the score output as the classifier to the given set of input features through classification technique. The classification technique is the features selection of the disease dissemination factors that likely have strong interconnection between each other in causing infectious disease outbreaks. The predictive analysis of epidemic disease in determining the infected area was introduced in this preliminary study by using the backpropagation method in observation of other's findings. This study will classify the epidemic disease dissemination factors as the features for weight adjustment on the prediction of epidemic disease outbreaks.

The provision of timely arrival time information is thus vital for passengers to minimize their waiting time and improve riders' confidence in the public transportation system, directly promoting more ridership. Multiple buses are commonly observed to arrive at a bus stop every hour. In this research, the prediction of estimated time of arrival (ETA) of buses is translated into a multi-label classification problem. Using buses historical global positioning system (GPS) arrival time, neural network models (ANN) are shown to be reliable solutions for the problem, and ensemble of neural networks are explored for more relevant output. The experimental results demonstrate that 77-78% of the time, ANN models are able to accurately predict arrival time of buses. The neural network models are able to outperform the other algorithms (i.e. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes) in the classification of multi-label arrival times by up to 8% based on performance metrics such as hamming loss, accuracy, and F1 scores. Among the ensemble models, Random A-labelsets (RAkEL) with 2-labelsets and 3-labelsets outperform the single neural network by 2-3% in multi-label accuracy and F1 scores. The findings are convincing for us to further explore other problem transformation and ensemble approaches in the future. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaboost; Bus Arrival time estimation; Ensemble; GPS; multi-label classification; Neural Network; RAkEL","Adaptive boosting; Bus transportation; Buses; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Global positioning system; Neural networks; Time of arrival; Transportation; Transportation routes; Arrival time; Ensemble; Ensemble neural network; Estimated time of arrivals; Multi label classification; Public transportation systems; RAkEL; Real-time traffic conditions; Data mining",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported by the Research University Grant (Grant No: 1001/PKOMP/814274) at the Universiti Sains Malaysia.",,"(2014) World's Population Increasingly Urban with More Than Half Living in Urban Areas', , http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/worldurbanization-prospects-2014.html, United Nation [Online] Available:.

However, during the discretization of firefly algorithm, one of the FA’s characteristics, i.e. the movement of a dimmer firefly towards a brighter firefly is unapparent as the movement are random. Thus, in this paper, the usage of swap operation as the movement strategy is proposed. The proposed algorithm, Swap-based Discrete Firefly Algorithm (SDFA), is then integrated with Nearest-Neighborhood initialization, reset strategy and Fixed Radius Near Neighbor 2-opt operator (FRNN 2-opt). The proposed algorithm is tested on 45 TSP instances and is compared with several states-of-the-art algorithm. The findings of this research show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively compared to the Discrete Firefly Algorithm, the Discrete Cuckoo Search, the Discrete Bat Algorithm, the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and the Discrete Bacterial Memetic Evolutionary Algorithm. On average, SDFA reports a percentage deviation of 0.02% from known optimum for TSP instances with dimension range from 14 to 318 cities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Combinatorial Optimization; Discrete optimization; Local search; Nature-inspired algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Bioluminescence; Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Problem solving; Traveling salesman problem; Discrete optimization; Discrete optimization problems; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Local search; Memetic evolutionary algorithms; Nature inspired algorithms; Nearest neighborhood; Percentage deviation; Optimization",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","Acknowledgement.

The pedestrian movement usually will be in the self-organizing state that involves the microscopic movement based on the basic Cellular Automata (CA) model. However, during the simulation of pedestrian movement, there are several features that should be highlighted that will affect the movement speed and time. Hence, this preliminary research paper introduced the horizontal transition of microscopic movement with some features that create the closeness to the human behavior for the pedestrian simulation. This preliminary research introduced a simple case study on the closed area floor design and implemented some of the features discussed. The result showed that the behavior of the pedestrian is affected by their environment situation and the movement time of the pedestrian is determined by the number of obstacles in the grid cells of the spatial layout for collision avoidance.","Behavioral; Cellular Automata Model; Layout Design; Normal Situation; Panic Situation; Pedestrian Movement",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE

Finding an optimal arrangement of furniture or an optimal spatial layout design is vital to minimise a production cost. Also, an optimal spatial layout design will promote the movement of people inside the space reducing any possible injuries. Implementing optimisation algorithms will assist in finding feasible spatial layout design and generating thousands of solutions in shorter period. This paper studies the application of Genetic Algorithm in solving problems regarding spatial layout design. It basically finds the best placements for the furniture in a given space taking into consideration several constraints. Non-overlapping objects is one of the main constraints in spatial layout design requirements. Thus, using non-overlapping ratios as a fitness function could assist in evaluating the quality of the generated solutions.","Fitness Function; Genetic Algorithm; Non-Overlapping; Optimisation; Spatial Layout Design",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: LRGS/203/PTS/6728001/2012/ USM","The authors wish to thank the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for funding this study under Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS/203/PTS/6728001/2012/ USM).",,"Gero, J.S., Kazakov, V.A., Evolving design genes in space layout planning problems (1998) Artificial Intelligence in Engineering, 12 (3), pp. 163-176; Lozano-Perez, T., Spatial planning: A configuration space approach (1983) Computers, IEEE Transactions on, 100 (2), pp. 108-120; Michalek, J., Choudhary, R., Papalambros, P., Architectural layout design optimization (2002) Engineering Optimization, 34 (5), pp. 461-484; Hassan, F.H., Swift, S., Tucker, A., Using heuristic search with pedestrian simulation statistics to find feasible spatial layout design elements (2014) Journal of Algorithms and Optimization, ISSN: 2312-7759, 2, pp. 86-104; Ciftcioglu, Ö., Sanja, D., Sevil, S., Architectural design for space layout by genetic algorithms (2002) The Architectural Annual, 2001; Luisa, G.C., Leslie, K.N., A design optimization tool based on a genetic algorithm (2002) Cambridge USA, Automation in Construction, 11, pp. 173-184; Rawat, C.D., Anmol, S., Abbas, N.N., Ronak, H., A genetic algorithm for VLSI floor planning (2012) V.E.S.I.T, Maharashtra, India, International Journal of Engineering Science & Advanced Technology, 2 (3), pp. 412-415; Taro, N., Kostas, T., (2006) Multiple-constraint Genetic Algorithm in Housing Design, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University; Deb, K., An efficient constraint handling method for genetic algorithms (2000) Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 186 (2), pp. 311-338",,,,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka",,,,,21801843,,,,"English","J.

The features classification on machine learning can be used to adopt the clustering method to define further analysis on the targeted issues. Nowadays, the epidemic disease outbreaks have caused a great concern towards Malaysian community as the diseases can cause great fatality. One of the common killer epidemic diseases in Malaysia is dengue fever. Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus that spreads by Aedes mosquitoes. The outbreaks cause several cases of death and it varies throughout the states in Malaysia. The factors that cause this epidemic disease were determined and the data on the dengue outbreaks in Malaysia were gathered. To predict the infected area of dengue, data were mined and the machine learning method was implemented. In this study, the clustering method in machine learning for predictive analysis is proven to be an effective method in determining the most infected area of dengue outbreaks in Malaysia: Selangor and W.P.

The aim of the experiment is to use the heat map agent to compute and to identify the clogging area in the layout generated. Results from the experiment have shown promising solutions in identifying a 'bad' region using heat map agents.

In addition, the proposed model includes the number of victims (i.e., caught in the fire) and the number of pedestrians who were evacuated safely.

For example, a well designed public building such as a train station or hospital should allow for the smooth flow of a large number of people. In extreme cases, design can be so poor that during emergency evacuations people have been crushed to death. It is vital that design takes into account the smooth flow of pedestrians.

Using pedestrian simulations, the activity of crowds can be used to study the consequences of different spatial layouts.

For example, the flow of a large number of people should be smooth in a well designed public space such as a stadium or hospital. In extreme cases, people might crush to death during emergency evacuations in poorly designed spaces. It is vital that design takes into account the smooth flow of pedestrians. In this paper we describe an initial exploration in using models of pedestrian flow combined with heuristic search to assist in the automatic design for spatial layout. A two-way pedestrian flow system is simulated and heuristic search techniques (genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and hill climbing) are used to find feasible spatial layouts based upon the generated statistics with promising results.","Cellular automata; Genetic algorithm; Hill-climbing; Pedestrian simulation; Simulated annealing; Spatial layout","Automatic design; Emergency evacuation; Extreme case; Heuristic search; Heuristic search technique; Hill climbing; Initial exploration; Pedestrian flow; Pedestrian simulation; Public space; Spatial layout; Cellular automata; Design; Genetic algorithms; Modular robots; Pattern recognition systems; Simulated annealing",,,,,,,,"Batty, M., Desyllas, J., Duxbury, E., The discrete dynamics of small-scale spatial events: Agent-based models of mobility in carnivals and street parades (2003) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 17 (7), pp. 673-697; Charman, P., Cermics, I., Antipolis, S., A constraint-based approach for the generation of floor plans (1994) Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 1994.
