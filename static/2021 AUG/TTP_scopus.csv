Travel narratives are among the richest sources of such spatial clues. They are also a reflection of writers’ interaction with places. One of the prevalent ways to model this interaction is a points of interest (POIs) graph depicting popular POIs and routes. A relevant notion is that frequent pairwise occurrences of POIs indicate their geographic proximity. This work presents an empirical interpretation of this theory and constructs spatially enriched POI graphs, a clear augmentation to popularity-based POI graphs. A triplet pattern, rule-based spatial relation extraction technique SpatRE is proposed and compared with standard relation extraction systems Ollie and Stanford OpenIE. A travel blogs data set is also contributed containing labelled spatial relations. The performance is further evaluated on SemEval 2013 benchmark data sets. Finally, spatially enriched POI graphs are qualitatively compared with TripAdvisor and Google Maps to visualise information accuracy. © The Author(s) 2019.","POI graphs; rule-based systems; spatial relation; travel pattern mining; travel planning","Benchmarking; Knowledge based systems; Geographic proximity; Information accuracy; POI graphs; Relation extraction; Spatial information extraction; Spatial relations; Travel pattern minings; Travel planning; Graphic methods",,,,,"1001/PKOMP/811335

The interest in sentiment analysis has been rising due to the availability of a large amount of sentiment corpus and the enormous potential of sentiment analysis applications. This work attempts to evaluate different machine learning techniques in predicting the sentiment of the readers toward business news headlines. News articles report events that have happened in the world and expert opinions. These are factors that will affect market sentiment, and a headline can be considered as a summary of an article in a single sentence. In this study, we constructed a sentiment analysis corpus which consists of business news headlines. We examined two different approaches, namely text classification and recurrent neural network (RNN) in predicting the sentiment of a business news headline. For text classification approach, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier, multinomial naïve Bayes, complement naïve Bayes and decision trees were experimented. On the other hand, for the RNN approach, we evaluated the typical RNN architecture and the encoder-decoder architecture in predicting the sentiment. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","business/finance news; recurrent neural networks; sentimental analysis; text classification","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Linguistics; Machine learning; Network architecture; Sentiment analysis; Encoder-decoder architecture; Expert opinion; Machine learning techniques; Multi layer perceptron; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); sentimental analysis; Text classification; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304","This work is funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia through the Bridging grant scheme 304.PKOMP.6316283.","Kušen, E., Strembeck, M., Politics, sentiments, and misinformation: An analysis of the Twitter discussion on the 2016 Austrian Presidential Elections (2018) Online Social Networks and Media, 5, pp. 37-50; Miranda, M.D., José Sassi, R., Using sentiment analysis to assess customer satisfaction in an online job search company Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 183, pp. 17-27; Kaushik, A., Kaushik, A., Naithani, S., A Study on Sentiment Analysis: Methods and Tools (2015) International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 4, pp. 287-292; Kiritchenko, S., Zhu, X., Cherry, C., Mohammad, S.M., Detecting aspects and sentiment in customer reviews (2014) 8Th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (Semeval), pp. 437-442. , pp., ACL, Dublin; Alharbi, M., M, A., de Doncker, E., Twitter sentiment analysis with a deep neural network: An enhanced approach using user behavioural information (2019) Cognitive Systems Research, 54, pp. 50-61. , pp; Zhang, L., Wang, S., Liu, B., Deep learning for sentiment analysis: A survey (2018) Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery; Godbole, N., Srinivasaiah, M., Skiena, S., Large-scale sentiment analysis for news and blogs.

Timeliness of data is important in making major decision. However, the manual data labeling method is slow and expensive, it also cannot cope with this enormous amount of data. We investigated the literature of sentiment analysis and discovered most of the works using manual data labeling. We propose semi-supervised learning as a method that helps to reducing the effort and time needed in data labeling as it uses a combination of small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data for model training. In our work, we trained semi-supervised deep neural network with different settings and compared the model performances to a baseline, the supervised deep neural network trained with same number of labeled data. From the results, we can see that the unlabeled data is useful in improving the data performances. But it is not a guarantee, the unlabeled data must be handled with care otherwise degraded the model performances. © 2019 The Authors.","Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment classification","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning; Data labeling; Data performance; Model performance; Model training; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised; Sentiment classification; Unlabeled data; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 and title, Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification.","Liu, (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , Morgan & Claypool; Hutto, C.J., Gilbert, E., Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text (2014) Proceedings of the Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 216-225; Priyani, G., Gupta, V., Singh, V.K., Ghose, U., A linguistic rule-based approach for aspect-level sentiment analysis of movie reviews (2017) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing; Agarwal, B., Mittal, N., Machine learning approach for sentiment analysis (2015) Socio-Affective Computing, pp. 21-45. , Springer; Chiong, R., A sentiment analysis-based machine learning approach for financial market prediction via news disclosures (2018) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion on - GECCO'18, pp. 278-279; Tripathy, A., Agrawal, A., Rath, S.K., Classification of sentiment reviews using n-gram machine learning approach (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 117-126; Fernández-Gavilanes, Álvarez-López, Juncal-Martínez, Costa-Montenegro, González-Castaño, Unsupervised method for sentiment analysis in online texts (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 58, pp. 57-75; Tan, Phang, Chin, Anthony, Rule-based sentiment analysis for financial news (2015) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pp. 1601-1606. , Kowloon; Na, Kyaing, Khoo, Foo, Chang, Theng, Sentiment classification of drug reviews using a rule-based linguistic approach (2012) ICADL 2012: The Outreach of Digital Libraries: A Globalized Resource Network, , Chen H, Chowdhury G eds Berlin, Springer; Prabowo, Thelwall, Sentiment analysis: A combined approach (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (2), pp. 143-157; Faulkner, Automated classification of stance in student essays: An approach using stance target information and the wikipedia link-based measure (2014) Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, pp. 174-179; Lane, Clarke, Hender, On developing robust models for favourability analysis: Model choice, feature sets and imbalanced data (2012) Decision Support Systems, 53 (4), pp. 712-718; Araque, Corcuera-Platas, Sánchez-Rada, Iglesias, Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 77, pp. 236-246; Hassan, Mahmood, Deep learning approach for sentiment analysis of short texts (2017) 3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR), pp. 705-710. , Nagoya; Dai, Le, Semi-supervised Sequence Learning (2015) NIPS'15 Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3079-3087; Iosifidis, Ntoutsi, Large scale sentiment learning with limited labels (2017) Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD'17, pp. 1823-1832. , ACM Press, New York, NY; Levatić, Ceci, Kocev, Džeroski, Semi-supervised Classification Trees (2017) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 49 (3), pp. 461-486; Pang, Lee, Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales (2005) ACL'05 Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 115-124; Guan, Chen, Zhao, Zheng, Tan, Cai, Weakly-supervised deep learning for customer review sentiment classification (2016) IJCAI'16 Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 3719-3725. , New York, NY","Gan, K.H.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: khgan@usm.my","Younus A.",,"Elsevier B.V.","5th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2019","23 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,156995,18770509,,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

Many studies attempt to extract parallel text from existing resources, particularly from comparable texts. The approaches to extract parallel text from comparable text can be divided into sentence-level approach and fragment-level approach. In this paper, an approach that combines sentence-level approach and fragment-level approach is proposed. The study was evaluated using statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT). The experiment results show a very significant improvement in the BLEU scores of SMT and NMT. The BLEU scores for SMT for the test in computer science domain and news domain increase from 17.45 and 41.45 to 18.56 and 48.65 respectively.

G2P is an important module in a speech synthesis system and an automatic speech recognition system. Two main G2P approaches are: knowledge-based and data-driven. The knowledge based G2P is built based on linguist knowledge. The data-driven approach such as the statistical approach on the other hand does not need expert knowledge, but it requires data to learn the rules. In this research, we propose an approach that combines linguistic knowledge into a statistical-based G2P convertor for Khmer. We examined a simple way of adding linguistic knowledge into the statistical G2P convertor by simply inserting vowel tags into a Khmer word. Three types of vowel tags were used. The main strength of this approach is it combines the strength of linguistic knowledge and statistical-based approach, to build a robust G2P model. The information allows better modeling and prediction of the phoneme sequence, thus improving the phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER). The PER and WER of our proposed Khmer G2P improve from 23.2% and 69.6% to 11.1% and 51.4% respectively. © 2019 The Authors.","Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P); Khmer; Rule-based G2P; Statistical G2P","Information use; Knowledge based systems; Speech recognition; Speech synthesis; Statistics; Automatic speech recognition system; Grapheme to phonemes; Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion; Khmer; Modeling and predictions; Rule based; Speech synthesis system; Statistical G2P; Linguistics",,,,,,,"Thu, Y.K., Pa, W.P., Sagisaka, Y., Iwahashi, N., Comparison of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion methods on a Myanmar pronunciation dictionary (2016) Proceedings of WSSANLP, pp. 11-22; Seng, S., Sam, S., Le, V.-B., Bigi, B., Besacier, L., Which units for acoustic and language modeling for Khmer automatic speech recognition?

The translation produced by an SMT is based on the statistical analysis of text corpora, while NMT uses the deep neural network to model and to generate a translation. SMT and NMT have their strength and weaknesses. SMT may produce a better translation with a small parallel text corpus compared to NMT. Nevertheless, when the amount of parallel text available is large, the quality of the translation produced by NMT is often higher than SMT. Besides that, study also shown that the translation produced by SMT is better than NMT in cases where there is a domain mismatch between training and testing. SMT also has an advantage in long sentences. In addition, when a translation produced by an NMT is wrong, it is very difficult to find the error. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid approach that combines SMT and NMT to perform English to Malay translation. The motivation for using a hybrid machine translation is to combine the strength of both approaches to produce a more accurate translation. Our approach uses the multi-source encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The architecture uses two encoders, one to embed the sentence to be translated, and another encoder to embed the initial translation produced by SMT. The translation from the SMT can be viewed as a ""suggestion translation"" to the neural MT. Our experiments show that the hybrid MT increases the BLEU scores of our best baseline machine translation in the computer science domain and news domain from 21.21 and 48.35 to 35.97 and 61.81 respectively. © 2018, Insight Society.","Hybrid machine translation; Neural machine translation; Statistical machine translation",,,,,,,,"Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) ""Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate"", , CoRR abs/1409.0473; Luong, T., Pham, H., Manning, D.C., ""Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation,"" (2015) Proc.

These reviews provide a significant basis on which potential customers can select the product that best meets their preferences. In online reviews, customers describe positive or negative experiences with a product or service or any part of it (i.e. features). Consumers frequently experience difficulty finding the desired product for comparison because of the massive number of online reviews. The automatic extraction of important product features is necessary to support customers in search of relevant product features. These features are the criteria that make it possible for customers to characterise different types of products. This article proposes a domain independent approach for identifying explicit opinionated features and attributes that are strongly related to a specific domain product using lexicographer files in WordNet. In our approach, N_gram analysis and the SentiStrength opinion lexicon have been employed to support the extraction of opinionated features. The empirical evaluation of the proposed system using online reviews of two popular datasets of supervised and unsupervised systems showed that our approach achieved competitive results for feature extraction from product reviews. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Feature extraction; lexicographer file; N_gram; sentiment analysis; SentiStrength; WordNet","Extraction; Feature extraction; Online systems; Ontology; lexicographer file; N_gram; Sentiment analysis; SentiStrength; Wordnet; Sales",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811335","This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/811335: Mining Unstructured Web Data For Tour Itineraries Construction), USM.","Liu, B., (2012) Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, 5 (1), pp. 1-167. , San Rafael, CA, Morgan & Claypool Publishers, (Synthesis lectures on human language technologies), no; Kavasoğlu, Z., Gündüz Öğüdücü, Ş., Personalized summarization of customer reviews based on user’s browsing history (2013) Int J Comput Sci Inf Syst, 8 (2), pp. 147-158; Gao, Q., Abel, F., Houben, G., A comparative study of users’ microblogging behavior on Sina Weibo and Twitter (2012) User modeling, adaptation, and personalization, pp. 88-101. , Masthoff, Mobasher, Desmarais, (eds), Berlin, Springer,.

Supporting the probable customers with a list of the most representative product aspects will assist their purchasing decision and facilitate the comparative process among the presented products. For the firms, identifying critical product aspects creates a new perspective of product manufacturing and marketing strategies to be competitive and innovative. However the manual identification of the most representative product aspects from the huge amounts of the extracted product aspects in online reviews is a tedious and time-consuming task. Thus, ranking the extracted aspects becomes a necessity to identify the important product aspects mentioned in the customer reviews. The purpose of this study is to formulate the product aspect ranking problem as a decision making process using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). In response, a comparative analysis between two different MCDM ranking approaches, namely; TOPSIS and VIKOR has been conducted to investigate their performances in prioritizing the most important product aspects in customer reviews. The experimental results on different product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods in prioritizing the genuine product aspects in customer feedback. © 2017 IEEE.","Aspect ranking; MCDM; Product aspect; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; VIKOR","Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Marketing; Aspect ranking; MCDM; Product aspects; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; VIKOR; Sales",,,,,,,"Hu, M., Liu, B., Mining opinion features in customer reviews (2004) 19th Natl.

Most of the conducted research studies extract the product aspects based on three main criteria: 1) extracting the aspects that have been commented repeatedly in online reviews, 2) determining of important aspects as those that have been described positively and negatively by many customers in their reviews, and 3) the association between the domain product aspect (like 'camera') and the other aspects contained in a specific product review. However, a lacuna remains as how to efficiently investigate online reviews to identify the most important product aspects by considering all the three criteria jointly. In response, this paper proposes a novel product aspect ranking framework using sentiment analysis and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The proposed work is decomposed into two stages: aspect extraction and aspect ranking. In aspect extraction stage, sentiment analysis is used to identify the product aspects from customer reviews in an unsupervised manner based on the three criteria of extraction. In the second stage, the extracted product aspects from the previous criteria have been involved simultaneously in TOPSIS to produce a ranked list of the most representative product aspects. The empirical evaluation of the proposed work using online reviews of four products shows its effectiveness in finding representative aspects. © 2016 IEEE.","Aspect ranking; MCDM; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; WordNet","Extraction; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Sales; Aspect ranking; MCDM; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; Wordnet; Data mining",,,,,,,"Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synth.

The pronunciation of a word is determined by the sequence of phonemes or some speech sounds. Each language or dialect might have different phoneme set. However, there is often a lack of phonological study for a dialect. The number of phonemes is unknown for some of the dialects or languages without a written form. In this work, we propose an approach to identify the phonemes for a dialect from the dialect text transcript and speech corpus, leveraging on existing resources from standard language and multilingual resources. Our study was carried out on Malay dialects. The result shows that the accuracy of the phoneme identification approach is high when we compare the results against previous works in the area.","Malay Dialect; Multilingual; Phoneme Identification; Text Transcript.",,,,,,,,"Maris, Y.M., (1979) The Malay Sound System, , Malaysia: Siri Teks Fajar Bakti; Reithaug, D., (2002) Orchestrating Success in Reading, , Canada: Stirling Head Enterprises; Norkevicius, G., Ra�kinis, G., Kazlauskiene, A., Knowledge-based grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of lithuanian words (2005) SPECOM 2005, 10th International Conference Speech and Compute, , Greece; Tan, T.P., Ranaivo-Malancon, B., Malay Grapheme to Phoneme Tool for Automatic Speech Recognition (2009) Third International Workshop on Malay and Indonesian Language Engineering, , Singapore; Stuker, S., Waibel, A., Towards Human Translations Guided Language Discovery for ASR Systems (2008) SLTU, Hanoi; Stuker, S., Besacier, L., Waibel, A., Human Translations Guided Language Discovery for ASR Systems (2009) Interspeech, , Brighton; Besacier, L., Zhou, B., Gao, Y., Towards Speech Transla- Tion of Non Written Languages (2006) SLT, , Aruba; Sitaram, S., Anumanchipalli, G.K., Chiu, J., Parlikar, A., Black, A.W., Text to Speech in New Languages without a Standardized Orthography (2013) Speech Synthesis Workshop; Sitaram, S., Palkar, S., Chen, Y., Parlikar, A., Black, A.W., Bootstrapping Text-to-Speech for Speech Processing in Languages Without an Orthography (2013) ICASSP, Canada; Stahlberg, F., Schlippe, T., Vogel, S., Schultz, T., Word Segmentation through Cross-Lingual Word-to-Phoneme Alignment (2012) SLT, , USA; Stahlberg, F., Schlippe, T., Vogel, S., Schultz, T., Pronunciation Extraction from Phoneme Sequences through Cross- Lingual Word-to-Phoneme Alignment (2013) SLSP, , Tarragona; Martirosian, O., Davel, M., Error Analysis of a Public Do- Main Pronunciation Dictionary (2007) PRASA; Rezaei, N., Salehi, A., An Introduction to Speech Sciences (Acoustic Analysis of Speech) (2006) Iranian Rehabilitation Journal, 4 (4), pp. 5-14; Colins, J.T., Malay Dialect Research in Malaysia: The Issue of Perspective (1989) Bijdragen Tot De Taal-, Land- En Volkenkunde, pp. 235-264; Asmah, H.O., (1991) Aspek Bahasa Dan Kajiannya, , Kuala Lumpur: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka; Ahmad, Z.B., (1991) The Phonology & Morphology of The Perak Dialect, , Kuala Lumpur: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka; Ladefoged, P., (2000) Vowels and Consonants: An Introduction to The Sound of Languages, , United Kingdom: Black Well Publishing; Schmitt, N., Winkler, A., Boretzki, M., Holube, I., A Phoneme Perception Test Method for High-Frequency Hearing Aid Fitting (2016) Journal of The American Academy of Audiology Fast Track, 27, pp. 367-379; Kent, R.D., Read, C., (2002) The Acoustic Analysis of Speech, , Canada: Singular/Thomson Learning; Kenneth, N.S., (2000) Acoustic Phonetics (current Studies in Linguistics), , Cambridge, MA: MIT; Huang, X.D., Acero, A., Hon, H.W., (2001) Spoken Language Processing: A Guide to Theory, Algorithm, and System Development, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall PTR; Cole, A., Muthusamy, Y.K., Oshika, B.T., The OGI Multi-language Telephone Speech Corpus (1992) Proc ICSLP'92, , Banff; Andersen, O., Dalsgaard, P., Barry, W., Data-Driven Identification of Poly- And Mono-phonemes for four European Languages (1993) Proceedings of EUROSPEECH'93, , Berlin; Bosman, A.J., (1989) Speech Perception by The Hearing Impaired, , Netherlands: Doctorial thesis, University of Utrecht; Gokcen, S., Gokcen, J.M., A Multilingual Phoneme and Model Set: Toward a Universal Base for Automatic Speech Recognition (1997) Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, Proceedings., , IEEE Workshop on; Rabiner, L., A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition (1989) Proceedings of The IEEE; Kienappel, A.K., Geller, D., Bippus, R., Cross-Language Transfer Of Multilingual Phoneme Models (2000) ASR2000 - Automatic Speech Recognition: Challenges for The New Millenium Paris, France; Tan, T.P., (2008) Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-native Speakers, , France: Universit � Joseph-Fourier Grenoble I; Ravishankar, M.K., (2006) Sphinx3 Decoders: Online, , http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx3/doc/s3_overview.html, Online.

This paper investigates the attention-based encoder-decoder LSTM networks in Malay part-of-speech (POS) tagging when it is compared to weighted finite state transducer (WFST) and hidden Markov model (HMM). The attractiveness of LSTM networks is its strength in modeling long distance dependencies. Malay POS tagging is examined from two different conditions: with and without morphological information. The experiment results show that LSTM networks that are trained without any explicit morphological knowledge perform nearly equally with WFST but better than HMM approach that is trained with morphological information.","Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks; Malay Part-Of-Speech Tagging; Recurrence Neural Network (RNN); Sequence-To-Sequence Learning.",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","This work is supported by Fundamental Research grant (FRGS) from Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia: 203.PKOMP.6711536","Nielsen, M., (2017) Neural Networks and Deep Learning, , http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/, Online; Graves, A., Mohamed, A.-R., Hinton, G., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks (2013) Proc.

The corpus is recorded under unscripted interview and conversational settings from 157 Singaporean and Malaysian speakers who spoke a mixture of Mandarin and English within a single sentence. About 82 % of the transcribed utterances are intra-sentential code-switching speech and the corpus will be release by LDC in 2015. This paper presents an analysis of the code-switching statistics of the corpus, such as the duration of monolingual segments and the frequency of language turns in code-switch utterances. We also summarize the development effort, details such as the processing time for transcription, validation and language boundary labelling. Lastly, we present textual analyses of code-switch segments examining the word length of monolingual segments in code-switch utterances and the most common single word and two-word phrase of such segments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Code-switching speech; Language recognition; Mandarin–English; Speech recognition; Spontaneous spoken corpus development",,,,,,,,"Auer, P., (1998) Code-switching in conversation: Language, interaction and identity, , Routledge, London; Bullock, B.E., Toribio, A.J., (2009) The Cambridge handbook of linguistic code-switch, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Demographic Characteristics, Education, Language and Religion, Department of Statistics, Ministry of Trade & Industry, Republic of Singapore (2011) January, p. 2011; Chan, H.S., Code-mixing in Hong Kong Cantonese–English bilinguals: Constraints and processes.

Manual news transcription is too expensive and takes a long time. Hence, without an ASR system, access to audio archives and searches within them would be restricted to the limited number of textual documents that have been manually transcribed by humans or indexed with keywords. Multiple hypotheses are useful because the single best recognition output still has numerous errors, even for state-of-The-Art systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the word error rate (WER) in an ASR hypothesis. This approach is known as the three-pass combination method using parallel ASR systems. The three-pass combination system based on grapheme rescoring and phone rescoring re-evaluates all of the hypotheses produced by the ASR systems to produce a more accurate hypothesis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, Malay broadcast news contains speech from newscaster, reporter and interviewers in noisy environments recorded from Malaysia local news channels are employed. This approach reduced the WER by 4.4% from 34.5% to 30.1%. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with six approaches that are frequently used for ASR rescoring and combination. © 2015 IEEE.","ASR Combination; Automatic Speech Recognition; Broadcast News;

Standard Malay is used as a source language whereas Kelantanese Malay is chosen to be target language in this study. Kelantan dialect is a Malay dialect from the northeast of Peninsular Malaysia. One of the most important steps and time consuming in building a HMM acoustic model is the alignment of speech sound. A good alignment will produce a clear and natural synthesize speech. The importance of this study is to propose a quick approach for aligning and building a good dialectal speech synthesis acoustic model by using a different source acoustic model. There are two proposed adaptation approaches in this study to synthesize dialectal Malay sentences using different amount of target speech and a source acoustic model to build the target acoustic model of speech synthesis system. From the results, we found out that the dialectal speech synthesis system built with adaptation approaches are much better in term of speech quality compared to the one without applying adaptation approach. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

This approach combines the hypotheses produced by parallel automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Each ASR system uses different language models, one which is generic domain model and another is domain specific model. The main idea is to take advantage of different ASR knowledge to improve ASR decoding result. It uses the language score and time information to produce a 1-best lattice, and then rescore the 1-best lattice to get the most likely word sequence as the final output. The proposed approach was compared with conventional combination approach, the recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER). Our proposed approach improved the word error rate (WER) from 33.9% to 30.6% with an average relative WER improvement of 9.74%, and it is better than the conventional ROVER approach. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

Solving ATSP is NP-hard and it is harder if the problem is with large scale data. This paper intends to address the ATSP using an hybrid approach which integrates the generic Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) framework and an insertion-based local search procedure. The generic BCO framework computationally realizes the bee foraging behaviour in a typical bee colony where bees travel across different locations to discover new food sources and perform waggle dances to recruit more bees towards newly discovered food sources. Besides the bee foraging behaviour, the generic BCO framework is enriched with an initialization engine, a fragmented solution construction mechanism, a local search and a pruning strategy. When the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of 27 ATSP benchmark problem instances, 37% of the benchmark instances are constantly solved to optimum. 89% of the problem instances are optimally solved for at least once. On average, the proposed BCO algorithm is able to obtain 0.140% deviation from known optimum for all the 27 instances. In terms of the average computational time, the proposed algorithm requires 48.955s (< 1 minutes) to obtain the best tour length for each instance. © 2013 IEEE.","bee foraging behaviour; generic framework; insertion; local search; metaheuristic","Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Local search (optimization); Operations research; Systems analysis; Foraging behaviours; Generic frameworks; insertion; Local search; Metaheuristic; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,,,"Wong, L.P., Low, M.Y.H., Chong, C.S., A generic bee colony optimization framework for combinatorial optimization problems (2010) Proceedings or the 4th Asia International Conference on Mathematical/ Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation.

Solving SOP requires finding a feasible Hamiltonian path with minimum cost without violating the precedence constraints. SOP models myriad of real world industrial applications, particularly in the fields of transportation, vehicle routing and production planning. The main objective of this research is to propose an idea of solving SOP using the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm. The underlying mechanism of the BCO algorithm is the bee foraging behavior in a typical bee colony. Throughout the research, the SOP benchmark problems from TSPLIB will be chosen as the testbed to evaluate the performance of the BCO algorithm in terms of the solution cost and the computational time needed to obtain an optimum solution. Moreover, efforts are taken to investigate the feasibility of using the Genetic Algorithm to optimally tune the parameters equipped in the existing BCO model. On average, over the selected 40 benchmark problems, the proposed method has successfully solved 9 (22.5%) benchmark problems to optimum, 17 (42.5%) benchmark problems ≤ 1% of deviation from the known optimum, and 37 (85%) benchmark problems ≤ 5% of deviation from the known optimum. Overall, the 40 benchmark problems are solved to 2.19% from the known optimum on average. © 2014 IEEE.","combinatorial optimization problem; genetic algorithm; local search; metaheuristic; path repairing procedure","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Production control; Repair; Bee colony optimizations; Combinatorial optimization problems; Local search; Metaheuristic; Precedence constraints; Production Planning; Repairing procedures; Sequential ordering problems; Optimization",,,,,,,"Montemanni, R., Smith, D.H., Rizzoli, A.E., Gambardella, L.M., Sequential ordering problems for crane scheduling in port terminals (2009) International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling, 5 (4), pp. 348-361; Spieckermann, S., Gutenschwager, K., Vob, S., A sequential ordering problem in automotive paint shops (2004) International Journal of Production Research, 42 (9), pp. 1865-1878; Wong, L.P., Low, M.Y.H., Chong, C.S., A generic bee colony optimization framework for combinatorial optimization problems (2010) Proceedings of the 4th Asia International Conference on Mathematical/ Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation.

To begin this study, we collected 8 hours of speech data due to no resources yet for ASR concerning this language. Following the lack of resources, we employed bootstrapping techniques on a closely-related language to build the Iban system. For this case, we utilized Malay data to bootstrap the grapheme-to-phoneme system (G2P) for the target language. We also developed several G2Ps to acquire Iban pronunciation dictionaries, which were later evaluated on the Iban ASR for obtaining the best version. Subsequently, we conducted experiments on cross-lingual ASR by using subspace Gaussian Mixture Models (SGMM) where the shared parameters obtained in either monolingual or multilingual fashion. From our observations, using out-of-language data as source language provided lower WER when Iban data is very imited. © 2014 IEEE.","acoustic modelling; automatic speech recognition; bootstrapping grapheme-to-phoneme; subspace Gaussian mixture model","Communication channels (information theory); Computational linguistics; Object recognition; Speech; Acoustic modelling; Automatic speech recognition; Automatic speech recognition system; Grapheme to phonemes; Pronunciation dictionaries; Subspace Gaussian Mixture Models; Target language; Under-resourced languages; Speech recognition",,,,,,,"Besacier, L., Barnard, E., Karpov, A., Schultz, T., Automatic speech recognition for under-resourced languages: A survey (2014) Speech Communication Journal, 56, pp. 85-100. , January; Maskey, S.R., Black, A.W., Tomokiyo, L.M., Bootstrapping phonetic lexicons for language (2004) Proc.

These works on multilingual acoustic modeling often use multilingual acoustic models to create an initial model. This initial model created is often suboptimal in decoding speech of the target language. Some speech of the target language is then used to adapt and improve the initial model. In this paper however, we investigate multilingual acoustic modeling in enhancing an acoustic model of the target language for automatic speech recognition system. The proposed approach employs context dependent acoustic model merging of a source language to adapt acoustic model of a target language. The source and target language speech are spoken by speakers from the same country. Our experiments on Malay and English automatic speech recognition shows relative improvement in WER from 2% to about 10% when multilingual acoustic model was employed.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for standard Malay-dialectal Malay parallel text alignment. The Malay dialects in Malaysia can be grouped according to the states such as Perak dialect, Kedah dialect and Terengganu dialect. It is important to learn Malay dialects as it is still flourished and widely used in many areas especially for unofficial matters.

Code switching is the switching of a language in a sentence or speech utterance. This paper focuses on LID of words in code switching sentences. Code switching can occur intersentential or intrasentential. The reasons why a writer switches from one language to another due to various reasons and among them are the inability to express opinion in a particular target language, to attract attention, to address different audience, habitual expressions and so on. The difficulty in identifying the languages of each word in a code switching sentence is because the languages have the same character set. In addition, code switching can happen in a sentence as short as a word or as long as a sentence. In this paper, we propose an automatic LID for words in code switching sentences by using multi structural word information (MUSWI) such as grapheme, syllable and word structure and calculate by using n-gram statistical model. The proposed MUSWI approach achieves 96.36% in term of accuracy on the code switching sentences, 99.07% on the multilingual sentences (non-code switching) which are under-resourced and closely related languages.

The proposed clustering method does not require users to predefined number of clusters. The three main stages of the clustering are sentences segmentation, indexing, and also term and sentence matching clustering. The sentences in the transcription will be segmented before indexing. Indexing involves tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, term selection and term representation. A vector space model (VSM) is used to represent the terms and sentences in the form of vectors. The sentences will then be grouped into clusters by using term and sentence matching thresholds.

The traditional approaches to train language model are mainly based on Chomsky hierarchy type 3 that approximates natural language as regular language. This approach ignores the characteristics of natural language. Our work attempted to overcome these limitations by extending the approach to consider Chomsky hierarchy type 1 and type 2. We extracted the dependency tree based lexical information and incorporate the information into the language model. The second pass lattice rescoring was performed to produce better hypotheses for Malay large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system.

A well-preserved virtual heritage does not include only the visual images of the heritage sites, but should ideally include also the audio surroundings of the heritage site that are incorporated into the virtual heritage applications as a whole. An acoustical heritage comprises the audio elements which surround the heritage sites. Psychoacoustic heritage is the extra significant psychological audio characteristic that adds to the surroundings of the heritage sites. In this paper, a randomized psychoacoustic model is proposed in 360° panoramic view on mobile platform. User interaction using multi-gesture tap is vital in delivering the psychoacoustic effects to the user. The contribution and the novelty of this research is in proposing and deploying a new psychoacoustic model mainly for the environment of 360° panoramic view in virtual heritage. In the proposed model, audio interaction design includes the changes in acoustical characteristics such as amplitude, frequency as well as the velocity within the various balanced panorama's azimuthal zones. Simulations have been carried out on a model of the Town Hall, one of the UNESCO heritage sites in George Town, Penang, Malaysia. The experimental data sets are also collected and have been found to produce promising psychoacoustic effects in panoramic view. © 2012 ACM.","acoustic modelling; acoustical heritage; amplitude; frequency; mobile virtual heritage; panoramic view; psychoacoustic","Acoustic modelling; acoustical heritage; amplitude; frequency; Panoramic views; psychoacoustic; Virtual heritage; Acoustic devices; Acoustics; Interactive computer graphics; Computer simulation",,,,,,,"Carillo, E., Kadobayashi, R., Chikanma Shimojo, S., Rodriguez-Echavarria Carillo, E., Kadobayashi, R., Chikanma, M., Shimojo, S., Arnold, D., Making history alive and interactive: Designing an iPhone app to present the summer war of Osaka Byobu 16th Int.

Accented speech imposes accuracy problem in automatic speech recognition systems. This frequently occurs to non-native speakers of a language due to insufficiency of the non-natives data in the recognizers. In this study, we investigate the mentioned problem by building a Malay model in our recognizer and test its performance for speakers of various ethnicities. Our Malay corpora consist of read speeches and texts that are collected from local newspapers in Malaysia. Speakers who contributed the speeches are of different ethnic backgrounds. We employ context dependent models by applying linear discriminant analysis for our acoustic model and a trigram based language model. Our experiments show improved results when linear discriminant analysis technique was employed in our model while our recognizer performed worst for speakers with accent that are not available in the training data. © 2012 IEEE.","Accent-specific speech recognition; Context dependent models; Malay automatic speech recognition system; RASR","Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Accuracy problems; Automatic speech recognition system; Context-dependent models; Different origins; Linear discriminant analysis; Non-native speakers; RASR; Speech recognition performance; Speech recognition",,,,,,,"www.statistics.gov.my, (2011) Population and vital statistics; www.wikipedia.org/wiki/EducationinMalaysia, Education in malaysia; www.cmusphinx.sourceforge.net, Cmusphinx: Open source toolkit for speech recognition; www.htk.eng.cam.ac.uk, Hidden markov model toolkit; www-i6.informatik.rwthaachen.de/rwth-asr, Rwth asr\-The rwth aachen university speech recognition system; Hussain, A., Othman, M., Shariff, Z.A.M.D., Recurrent backpropagation neural subnetworks for phoneme based malay speech recognition (1997) ISPACS 97, , Malaysia; Fledge, J., (1995) Second Language Speech Learning:theory, pp. 223-277. , findings and problems.

Malay is the official language in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei. However, Malay spoken in different countries, and even within a country itself might vary in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary from one place to another. The Malay dialects in Malaysia can be grouped according to the states of the country. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a Malay dialect translation and synthesis system, that given a sentence in standard Malay, it translates and synthesizes an utterance in the dialect requested. The system consists of 3 modules, dialect translation system, dialect G2P system, and speech synthesis system. The outcome from this study is two folds. From linguistic viewpoint, it will help us understanding and appreciating the interesting differences in the Malay dialect in Malaysia, which is important to help preserve the dialect and culture in it. Secondly, the proposed system will be useful for people who like to learn a particular dialect or it can be used in places that require this facility. At this stage, we have completed the standard Malay system, and this paper presents our work so far. © 2012 IEEE.","Dialect; Malay; Speech synthesis","Natural language processing systems; Speech synthesis; Dialect; Indonesia; Malay; Malaysia; Official languages; Singapore; Speech synthesis system; Translation systems; Translation (languages)",,,,,,,"O'Grady, W., Archibald, J., (2000) Contemporary Linguistic Analysis: An Introduction, , Addison Wesley Longman, Toronto; Colins, J.T., Malay dialect research in malaysia: The issue of perspective (1989) Bijdragen Tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde, pp. 235-264; Ahmad, Z.B., (1991) The Phonology &Morphology of the Perak Dialect, , Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka; Maris, Y.M., (1979) The Malay Sound System.

The corpus is developed as part of a multilingual speech recognition project and will be used to examine how Mandarin-English codeswitch speech occurs in the spoken language in South-East Asia. Additionally, it can provide insights into the development of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) for code-switching speech.

Two existing pronunciation modeling approaches, namely the pronunciation dictionary and n-best rescoring approach are modified to work with little amount of non-native speech. We also propose a speaker clustering approach, which capable of grouping the speakers based on their pronunciation habits. Given some speech, the approach can also be used for pronunciation adaptation. This approach is called latent pronunciation analysis. The results show that conventional pronunciation dictionary perform slightly better than n-best list rescoring, while the latent pronunciation analysis has shown to be beneficial for speaker clustering, and it can produce nearly the same improvement as the pronunciation dictionary approach, without the need to know the origin of the speaker.

These interpolation techniques are manual interpolation, weighted least square and eigen voices. Each of them can be used under different situation and constraints. In contrast to weighted least square and eigenvoices methods, manual interpolation can be achieved offline without any adaptation data. These methods can also be combined with MLLR to improve the recognition rate. Experiments presented in this paper show that the best non native adaptation method, combined with MLLR can give 10% WER absolute reduction on a French automatic speech recognition system for both Chinese and Vietnamese native speakers. © 2007 IEEE.","Adaptation; Interpolation; Non-native ASR","Acoustic properties; Automation; Constraint theory; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Interpolation; Least squares approximations; Acoustic model interpolation; Adaptation method; Automatic speech recognition; Non-native speech recognition; Speech recognition",,,,,,,"Witt, S., (1999) Use of Speech Recognition in Computer Assisted Language Learning, , University of Cambridge, Ph.D Thesis; Goronzy, S., (2002) Robust Adaptation to Non-Native Accents in Automatic Speech Recognition, , Springer Verlag, German; Wang, Z., Schultz, T., Non-Native Spontaneous Speech Recognition through Polyphone Decision Tree Specialization (2003) Proc Eurospeech-03, pp. 1449-1452. , Geneva, pp; Flege, J., The Production of 'New' and 'Similar' Phones in a Foreign Language: Evidence for the Effect of Equivalence Classification (1987) Journal of Phonetics, 15, pp. 47-65; Juang, B.H., Rabiner, L.R., A Probabilistic Distance Measure for Hidden Markov Models (1985) AT&T Technical Journal, 64 (2), pp. 391-408; Humpries, J.J., Woodland, P., The Use of Accent-Specific Pronunciation Dictionaries in Acoustic Model Training (1998) ICASSP-98, 1, pp. 317-320. , Seattle; Montgomery, D.C., Peck, E.A., Geoffrey Vining, G., (2001) Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, , 3rd Edition, Wiley; Kuhn, R., Nguyen, P., Goldwasser, L., Niedzielski, N., Fincke, S., Contolini, M., Eigenvoices for Speaker Adaptation (1998) ICSLP 98, pp. 1774-1777. , Sydney, pp; Nguyen, P., Fast Speaker Adaptation Technical report, Eurecom, 1998; Westwood, R.J., (1999) Speaker Adaptation Using Eigen voices, , University of Cambridge, MPhil Thesis; Tan, T.P., Besacier, L., A French Non-Native Corpus for Automatic Speech Recognition (2006) LREC 2006, pp. 1610-1613. , Genoa, pp; Lamel, L.F., Gauvain, J.L., M., E., BREF, a Large Vocabulary Spoken Corpus for French (1991) Eurospeech-91, pp. 505-508. , Genoa, pp; Le, V.B., Do-Dat, T., Casteli, E., Besacier, L., Serignat, J.F., Spoken and written language resources for Vietnamese (2004) LREC 2004, pp. 599-602. , Lisbon, pp; Corpora, C.C.C., Chinese, , http://www.dear.com/CCC/corpora. htm, Corpus Consortium","Tan, T.-P.; CLIPS-IMAG Laboratory, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 9, France; email: tien-ping.tan@imag.fr",,"Inst. of Electrical and Electronics Eng.
