Cyberstalking detection has become increasingly popular in recent years and has technically been investigated by many researchers. However, cyberstalking victimization, an essential part of cyberstalking, has empirically received less attention from the paper community. This paper attempts to address this gap and develop a model to understand and estimate the prevalence of cyberstalking victimization. The model of this paper is produced using routine activities and lifestyle exposure theories and includes eight hypotheses. The data of this paper is collected from the 757 respondents in Jordanian universities. This review paper utilizes a quantitative approach and uses structural equation modeling for data analysis. The results revealed a modest prevalence range is more dependent on the cyberstalking type. The results also indicated that proximity to motivated offenders, suitable targets, and digital guardians significantly influences cyberstalking victimization. The outcome from moderation hypothesis testing demonstrated that age and residence have a significant effect on cyberstalking victimization. The proposed model is an essential element for assessing cyberstalking victimization among societies, which provides a valuable understanding of the prevalence of cyberstalking victimization. This can assist the researchers and practitioners for future research in the context of cyberstalking victimization. © 2021 by the authors.

However, multilevel thresholding becomes increasingly more computationally complex as the number of thresholds grows. In order to address this defect, this paper proposes a new multilevel thresholding approach based on the Evolutionary Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). The arithmetic operators in science were the inspiration for AOA. DAOA is the proposed approach, which employs the Differential Evolution technique to enhance the AOA local research. The proposed algorithm is applied to the multilevel thresholding problem, using Kapur’s measure between class variance functions. The suggested DAOA is used to evaluate images, using eight standard test images from two different groups: Nature and CT COVID-19 images. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index test (SSIM) are standard evaluation measures used to determine the accuracy of segmented images. The proposed DAOA method’s efficiency is evaluated and compared to other multilevel thresholding methods. The findings are presented with a number of different threshold values (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). According to the experimental results, the proposed DAOA process is better and produces higher-quality solutions than other comparative approaches. Moreover, it achieved better-segmented images, PSNR, and SSIM values. In addition, the proposed DAOA is ranked the first method in all test cases. © 2021 by the authors.

This component consists of use hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and RAM, collectively fulfilling the requirement of simultaneous fast data access and large data distribution to numerous users. However, current hybrid storage systems still pose numerous challenges. The integration and roles of the HDD, SSD, and RAM are relatively weak in terms of optimizing fast access prior to streaming to a large number of simultaneous users. The HDD and SSD exhibit poor data layout and streaming controller in supporting the production of a high number of simultaneous streams. This paper proposes (1) the flash cache hybrid storage system (FCHSS) VOD servers. The FCHSS architecture has no RAM, which is removed and replaced by a flash-based SSD. (2) The new data layout stores thousands of video segments in the HDD and SSD. The streaming management scheme, namely, flash cache-data streaming controller (FC-DSC), is also proposed to support FCHSS. The proposed VOD server-based FCHSS with the FC-DSC shows a 73.53% and 23.71% enhancement in average total response time, and a 35.63% and 298.91% enhancement in throughputs for all request sizes compared with the average of the total response time and throughputs of the hybrid storage system HSS VOD server-and the VOD server-based feedback-based adaptive data migration (FADM). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Flash cache hybrid storage system (FCHSS); Flash cache-data streaming controller (FC-DSC); Hard disk drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-state-drive (SSD); Throughput; Video on demand (VOD),Controllers; Data reduction; Drives; Flash-based SSDs; Intelligent computing; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Storage management; Throughput; Video on demand; Cache data; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storage systems; Solid state drives (SSD); Video on demands (VoD); Hard disk storage,,,,,,,"Al-Wesabi, O.A., Sumari, P., Al-Wesabi, M.A., Proxy caching strategies for multimedia distribution (2016) Int.

In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile Cloud Gaming; Network Delay; Playout Delay; Processing Delay; Response Delay,Computer architecture; Image communication systems; Intelligent computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile clouds; Network delays; Playout delay; Processing delay; Response delays; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,,,"http://www.angrybirds.com; https://www.pubgmobile.com; https://www.gameloft.com/en/game/modern-combat-5; https://www.pokemongo.com; http://www.nvidia.com/object/cloud-gaming; Srivastava, P., Khan, R., A review paper on cloud computing Int.

IPTV is a system that exploits the high speed broadband networks to deliver TV services to the subscribers. From the service provider viewpoint, the challenge in IPTV systems is how to build delivery networks that exploits the resources efficiently and reduces the service cost, as well. However, designing such delivery networks are affected by many factors including choosing the suitable network architecture, load balancing, resources waste, and cost reduction. Furthermore, IPTV contents characteristics; particularly size, popularity, and interactivity play an important role in balancing the load and avoiding the resources waste for delivery networks. Ignoring the content status in solving delivery networks issues particularly replica placement, request distribution, and resource allocation problems leads to load imbalance, which in turn, leads to performance degradation in IPTV system. In this survey paper, we introduce IPTV delivery networks terminology and taxonomy. Upon that, we investigate the challenges related to the contents’ awareness in those delivery networks. At the end of the paper, we propose a content-awareness in ITV delivery networks and CDN as the future direction and discuss its importance in different aspects as request redirection, resource allocation, and replica placement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Content status; Delivery networks; IPTV; IPTV delivery networks; Load balancing; Replica placement,Computer graphics; Cost reduction; HIgh speed networks; IPTV; Multimedia systems; Network architecture; Resource allocation; Surveys; Television broadcasting; Content status; Load imbalance; Performance degradation; Replica placement; Request distributions; Request redirection; Resource allocation problem; Service provider; Broadband networks,,,,,,,"Aldana Diaz, M.E., Huh, E.N., Cost analysis on IPTV hosting service for 3rd party providers (2011) Proc 5Th Int Conf Ubiquitous Inform Manag Commun, p. 114. , ACM; Alemany, J., Thathachar, J.S., (1997) Random striping news on demand servers, , Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Technical report -TR-97-02-02; Almeida, J.M., (2003) Streaming content distribution networks with minimum delivery cost, , Doctoral dissertation.

IPTV is a system that employs the high speed broadband networks to deliver TV services to the subscribers. From the service provider viewpoint, the challenge in IPTV systems is how to build delivery networks that exploits the resources efficiently and reduces the service cost, as well. However, designing such delivery networks affected by many factors including choosing the suitable network architecture, load balancing, resources waste, and cost reduction. Furthermore, IPTV contents characteristics, particularly; size, popularity, and interactivity play an important role in balancing the load and avoiding the resources waste for delivery networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of resource allocation for IPTV delivery networks over the recent architecture, peer-service area architecture. The Genetic Algorithm as an optimization tool has been used to find the optimal provisioning parameters including storage, bandwidth, and CPU consumption. The experiments have been conducted on two data sets with different popularity distributions. The experiments have been conducted on two popularity distributions. The experimental results showed the impact of content status on the resource allocation process. Copyright © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The hybrid storage system, which combines HDDs and SSD in the server, has become popular because of such requirements. The combination of both storage modes is relatively weak in terms of optimising fast access prior and in supporting the production of a high number of simultaneous streams. This paper presents an enhanced hybrid storage system (EHSS)-based VOD server to improve the performance of the VOD server. The design of the EHSS and its streaming management scheme produce high performance and satisfy the performance requirements of a VOD server in terms of I/O throughput and access latency. The experimental results show that the proposed work provides better performance than the VOD server-based FADM because it enhances the average response times for the various scales of intensive workload by 69.89%.

However, this system causes some user pains and problems, i.e. high capital investment, setup and maintenance hassle, lack of flexibility and reliability, and data security and privacy concern. Cloud computing as an emerging technology is used for developing a cloud-based POS software named RetailNow. A cloud service provider is in charge of delivering and maintenances of the software to retailers based on their environments. The provider is also responsible for security and privacy of data on its servers. Due to the pay-per-use subscription model of the cloud, retailers also save in their finance. The retailers only require a basic computer and an internet connection in order to connect to RetailNow. RetailNow is targeted for all scales and environments of retail outlets. The purpose of the study is to understand the influential factors that impact on intention to use RetailNow among retailers in Malaysia. The proposed model is the combination of the TOE and the TAM to obtain applicability and predictive power. In order to test the proposed model, a quantitative study using a self-administrated survey will be directed. A research method which is based on the multi-analytical approach of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is applied which enables extra verification of the results provided by the PLS-SEM for direct relationships in the model. We only apply PLS-SEM for testing the mediation effect. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",ANN; Cloud-based POS; PLS-SEM; RetailNow; SaaS; TAM; The Point of Sale (POS) system; TOE,Data privacy; Investments; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Soft computing; Cloud service providers; Cloud-based; Data security and privacy; Partial least square (PLS); Point of sale; RetailNow; SaaS; Structural equation modeling; Sales,,,,,,,"Blokdijk, G., (2015) Point of sale—simple Steps to Win, Insights and Opportunities for Maxing out Success; Margaret Weber, M., Prasad Kantamneni, S., POS and EDI in retailing: An examination of underlying benefits and barriers (2002) Supply Chain Manag, 7 (5), pp. 311-317; Tolbert, F., Why point of sales data matters for demand management (2009) J.

Depending on the number of bits in each cell, Flash memory can be designed as single/multi/triple level cell (SLC/MLC/TLC), which have different performance, density, cost and write endurance characteristics. To bring the best of these together, several researchers have proposed designing SSD using hybrid SLC/MLC/TLC Flash memory. However, these SSDs also present several challenges such as buffer management, placement of hot/cold data in suitable portion, and intelligent garbage collection. Several recent techniques aim to address these challenges. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for managing SSDs designed with SLC/MLC/TLC Flash memory. We classify the works on several axes to bring out their similarities and differences. We aim to synthesize the state-of-art progress in hybrid SSD management and also spark further research in this area.

Large-scale VOD servers need to provision a large number of concurrent requests with fast response time. However, improving the performance of VOD server has become so obstructive and limited due to high latency of the disk access and low I/O operation of the magnetic HDDs. By contrast, flash-based solid-state drive (SSD) has fast access reading and provides large I/O operation per second that makes it as an interesting alternative choice. Nevertheless, using SSD instead of the entire HDD is very expensive due to SSD costs high in price per gigabyte. Accordingly, combination of HDD and SSD can enhance the performance of the storage subsystem of a VOD server in a cost-effective way. In this paper, hybrid storage system (HSS) is proposed in VOD server in order to increase the number of simultaneous user requests and decrease startup latency in an economic way. The top 10% of popular videos are kept in SSD to exploit its fast access for read-intensive workloads. Our results show that the design of our proposed HSS produces high performance than the conventional VOD HDD-based server which the enhancement in the average total response times for all different request sizes by 65%. Also, the throughput is enhanced by 200%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Hard Disk Drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-State-Drive (SSD); Throughput; Video On Demand (VOD),Cost effectiveness; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Response time (computer systems); Concurrent requests; Cost effective; Fast response time; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storage systems; Storage subsystems; Total response; Video-on-demand servers; Video on demand,,,,,,,"Zhao, Y., Jiang, H., Zhou, K., Huang, Z., Huang, P., Meeting service level agreement cost-effectively for video-on-demand applications in the cloud (2014) INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 298-306. , IEEE; Al-wesabi, O.A., Sumari, P., Al-wesabi, M.A., Proxy caching strategies for multimedia distribution (2016) Int.

It involves analyzing dynamic information and behaviors that are stored in the execution trace. However, the execution traces of current object-oriented software systems tend to be very large in terms of complexity and size. In particular, classes and coupling features form a very complicated interwoven lattice of the dynamic dependencies. This research focuses on detecting and removing utility classes from an execution trace. Utility detection and removal techniques are very useful in reducing the structural complexity of execution traces for software comprehension process. For this purpose, two new utility classes detection metrics based on dynamic coupling have been introduced to measure the extent to which a class can be considered as a utility. © 2017 IEEE.",dynamic coupling; execution trace analysis; object-oriented; software comprehension; software maintenance; utility classes,Computer software maintenance; Trace analysis; Dynamic couplings; Execution trace analysis; Object oriented; Software comprehension; utility classes; Object oriented programming,,,,,,,"Demeyer, S., Ducasse, S., Nierstrasz, O., (2003) Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns, , Morgan Kaufmann; Ko, A.J., Myers, B.A., Coblenz, M.J., Aung, H.H., An exploratory study of how developers seek, relate, and collect relevant information during software maintenance tasks (2006) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 32 (12), pp. 971-987; Storey, M.-A., Theories, tools and research methods in program comprehension: Past, present and future (2006) Software Quality Journal, Springer, (14), pp. 187-208; Lethbridge, T.C., Singer, J., Forward, A., How software engineers use documentation: The state of the practice (2003) IEEE Software Special Issue: The State of the Practice of Software Engineering, pp. 35-39; Sommerville, I., (2011) Software Engineering, , Ninth edition.

Current discrete wavelet transform (DWT) steganography adds an unacceptable distortion to the images and is considered as an ineffective in terms of security. Applying the DE scheme to the current DWT steganographic methods solves the problems of these methods, and reduces the distortion added to the images, and thus improves the embedding efficiency. The proposed algorithm first converts the secret image into a sequence of base-5 digits. After that, the cover image is transformed into the DWT domain and segmented into 2 × 1 coefficient pairs. The DE scheme is used then to change at most one coefficient of each coefficient pair to embed the base-5 digits. Experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in embedding compared to other methods in terms of embedding payload and image quality. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is attacked by well-known steganalysis software. Results are showing that the proposed algorithm is secure against the powerful universal steganalyzer “ensemble classifier” and the histogram attack. The results also reveal that the proposed algorithm is robust against different image processing attacks such as compression, added noise, and cropping attacks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Diamond encoding (DE); Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Embedding payload; Image steganography; Imperceptibility,Diamonds; Discrete wavelet transforms; Encoding (symbols); Image coding; Image processing; Steganography; Wavelet transforms; Diamond encoding; Embedding algorithms; Embedding efficiency; Embedding payload; Ensemble classifiers; Image steganography; Imperceptibility; Steganographic algorithms; Digital image storage,,,,,,,"Al-Ani, Z.K., Overview: main fundamentals for steganography (2010) J Comput, 2 (3), pp. 158-165; Al-Dmour, H., Al-Ani, A., A steganography embedding method based on edge identification and XOR coding (2016) Exp Syst Appl, 46, pp. 293-306; Al-Korbi, H.A., Al-Ataby, A., Al-Taee, M.A., Al-Nuaimy, W., High-capacity image steganography based on Haar DWT for hiding miscellaneous data (2015) IEEE Jordan Conf Appl Electrical Eng Comput Technol (AEECT), 1, pp. 1-6; Atawneh, S., Almomani, A., Sumari, P., Steganography in digital images: common approaches and tools (2013) IETE Tech Rev, 30 (4), pp. 344-358; Baby, D., Thomas, J., Augustine, G., George, E., Michael, N.R., A novel DWT based image securing method using steganography (2015) Procedia Comput Sci, 46, pp. 612-618; Barve, S., Nagaraj, U., Gulabani, R., Efficient and secure biometric image stegnography using discrete wavelet transform (2011) Int J Comput Sci Commun Netw, 1 (1), pp. 96-99; Chan, C.-K., Cheng, L.-M., Hiding data in images by simple LSB substitution (2004) Pattern Recogn, 37 (3), pp. 469-474; Chao, R.M., A novel image data hiding scheme with diamond encoding (2009) EURASIP J Inf Secur, 2009 (1), pp. 1-9; Chen, M., (2006) Analysis of current steganography tools: classifications & features.

As a result, many researchers proposed some mapping architectures when two users want to communicate using different chatting applications by proposing a translation gateway in order to translate the message format of the sender to the receiver message format. This paper provides a comparison with respect to the packet delay of the interworking module between heterogeneous protocols; Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol (IAX) and Jingle protocol in case of the existence of one (two ways) translation gateway, and the existence of two (one way) translation gateways.

The difficulty of storing and fetching required data from data centers and servers will consequently increase. As a result, significant attention has been given to the flash memory-based solid state drive (SSD) from consumer electronics companies, which has begun to replace the existing hard disk drive and is highly likely to be used as a storage unit for most of consumer electronics to achieve low power consumption. In contrast to traditional disk, SSD uses semiconductor chips to store data. This structure enjoys original technical characteristics, including low power consumption, shock resistance, and high performance in random access. Such features can overcome the shortcomings of magnetic disks. However, flash memory, the basic unit of SSD, has many distinctive characteristics that cause various challenges. Flash memory does not support updating in the place method. A write operation can be performed only on an empty or erased unit, making the process more time-consuming. Moreover, each storage unit has a limited number of erase cycles, after which the block becomes invalid. This research proposes a new scheme called performance and reliability concern to increase the reliability and performance of SSDs. The eligibility of the proposed scheme is proven through EagleTree simulator. The scheme is also compared with other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides sufficient performance and reliability for SSD. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Consumer electronics; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Reliability; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Electronics company; Garbage collection; Low-power consumption; Performance and reliabilities; Semiconductor chips; Solid state drives (SSD); State-of-the-art techniques; Flash memory,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PK-OMP/817066,This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. (1001/PK-OMP/817066).,"Bai, S., Yin, J., Tan, G., Wang, Y.-P., Hu, S.-M., Fdtl: a unified flash memory and hard disk translation layer (2011) IEEE Trans Consum Electr, 57 (4), pp. 1719-1727; Ban, A., (1995) Flash file system, uS Patent 5, 404, p. 485; Bellard, F., Qemu, a fast and portable dynamic translator.

Penang, 11800, Malaysia","Due to the enormous improvement in networking and multimedia, IPTV has become recently a popular means to distribute high quality TV services over IP networks. Accordingly, Telecommunication companies started the competition to provide IPTV services to increase their customer base and profit. The key concern of service providers in this hectic competition is to provide high quality service with lower cost. However, the contents’ popularity and the users’ preferences are fluctuated rapidly, which leads to resources waste and load imbalance. Thus, the contents’ status should be considered during the content replication to save resources and reduce service cost. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigate the impact of contents’ status on building Replica Placement Strategy. Therefore, this paper studies the impact of contents’ status on replica placement strategy over the peer-service area architecture. Two optimization models are proposed Cost Effective Model (CE), which replicates the contents partially without considering contents’ status and Cost Effective with Load Balance model (CELB), which considers the contents’ status. Both models have been solved using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm. The experimental results show that CELB model outperforms the other models in terms of Storage Saving Ratio (SSR), load distribution, and allocation cost. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Content status; Heuristic repair algorithm; Hybrid genetic algorithm; IPTV delivery networks; Load balancing; Replica placement,Cost effectiveness; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Multimedia services; Network architecture; Network management; Optimization; Resource allocation; Telecommunication services; Television broadcasting; Content status; High quality service; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Optimization models; Repair algorithms; Replica placement; Replica placement strategies; Telecommunication companies; IPTV,,,,,,,"Almeida, J.M., Streaming content distribution networks with minimum delivery cost, Ph.D (2003) University of Wisconsin, , Madison; Bektas, T., Cordeau, J., Erkut, E., Laporte, G., Exact algorithms for the joint object placement and request routing problem in content distribution networks (2008) J Comput Opera Res, 35 (12), pp. 3860-3884; Bisdikian, C.C., Patel, B.B., Cost-based program allocation for distributed multimedia-on-demand systems (1996) IEEE Multimed, 3 (3), pp. 62-72; Bolosky, W.J., Barrera, J.S., Draves, R.P., Fitzgerald, R.P., Gibson, G.A., Jones, M.B., Levi, S.P., Rashid, R.F., The tiger video fileserver.

As a result, many researchers proposed some mapping architectures when two users want to communicate using different chatting applications by proposing a translation gateway in order to translate the message format of the sender to the receiver message format. This paper presents a comparison with respect to the packet loss for the homogeneous and heterogeneous protocols media exchange environments including the two main media session architectures. © 2016 IEEE.",media exchange;

This paper presents an enhanced vocabulary-based dictionary algorithm for protecting web user by receiving unwanted spam mails. The proposed algorithm identifies and classifies legitimate incoming mails against unsolicited email attacks. We present a porter stemmer algorithm as a part of normalization process for removing the common morphological and inflexional endings from English words. A comparative study and evaluation of these classification approaches are carried out using machine-learning techniques. The performance of the proposed algorithm is visualized using confusion matrix. The experimental results show that our method produces less number of false negatives when compared with existing techniques. © 2016 IEEE.",dictionary approach; email classification; porter stemmer algorithm; text categorization,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Electronic mail; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Classification approach; Comparative studies; Complete solutions; Confusion matrices; Email classification; Machine learning techniques; Normalization process; Text categorization; Text processing,,,,,,,"Miszalska, I., Zabierowski, W., Napieralski, A., Selected methods of spam filtering in email (2007) CAD Systems in Microelectronics, 2007.

The blood vessels in the retina get altered and have abnormality. Exudates are secreted, micro-aneurysms and haemorrhages occur in the retina. The appearance of these features represents the degree of severity of the disease. Early detection of diabetic retinopathy plays a major role in the success of such disease treatment. The main challenge is to extract exudates which are similar in colour property and size of the optic disk, and then micro-aneurysms are similar in colour and proximity with blood vessels. The main objective of the paper is to develop a computer aided detection system to find the abnormality of retinal imaging and detects the presence of abnormality features from retinal fundus images. There is few existing research works have been undergone by applying machine learning techniques, but existing approaches have not achieved a good accuracy of detection and they have not yielded successful performance in different datasets. The proposed methodology is to enhance the image and filter the noise, detect blood vessel and identify the optic disc, extract the exudates and micro aneurysms, extract the features and classify different stages of diabetic retinopathy into mild, moderate, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR) by using proposed machine learning methods. The expected output of proposed work in this paper will be a preliminary design and pilot prototype development. © 2016 IEEE.",diabetes; exudates; microaneurysm; segmentation and classification,Artificial intelligence; Blood vessels; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Medical problems; Ophthalmology; Classification approach; Computer aided detection; Computer aided detection systems; exudates; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Microaneurysms; Eye protection,,,,,,,"WHO, (2011), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/; Yun, L.W., Acharya, U.R., Venkatesh, Y.V., Chee, C., Min, L.C., Ng, E.Y.K., Identification of different stages of diabetic retinopathy using retinal optical images (2008) Information Sciences, 178, pp. 106-121; Liew, G., Wong, T., Mitchell, P., Wang, J.J., Retinal vascular imaging -A New Tool in Micro vascular disease Research (2008) Advances in Cardiovascular Imaging; Jiang, X., Mojon, D., Adaptive local thresholding by verificationbased multi-threshold probing with application to vessel detection in retinal images (2003) IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25 (1), pp. 131-137; Niemeijer, M., Van Ginneken, B., Staal, J., Suttorp-Schulten, M., Abràmoff, M., Automatic detection of red lesions in digital color fundus photographs (2005) Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on, 24 (5), pp. 584-592; Spencer, T., Olson, J.A., McHardy, K.C., Sharp, P.F., Forrester, J.V., An image-processing strategy for the segmentation and quantification of micro aneurysms in fluorescein angiograms of the ocular fundus (1996) Comput.

It is considered a part of the e-learning system, which helps disseminate teaching and learning materials. This research explores the benefits of storage technology to enhance the performance of a VOD system in term of serving multi-users within the same buffer with a hybrid storage system (HDD/SSD). This study proposes a streaming management scheme is called (MSA) that uses a SSD as non-volatile cache instead of RAM in a VOD server. This case considers the write workload because of the buffer cache in a SSD for unpopular videos that are stored in HDD. To avoid the negative effects of garbage collection and erase-before-write, MSA adopts OP-FCL to manage the storage capacity of the SSD during buffering. The proposed streaming algorithm is expected to satisfy the performance requirements of a large-scale VOD server in term of input/output throughput. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Consultation with plant pathologists to diagnose plant diseases is time consuming, considering that time is an important factor in disease control. Therefore, it is necessary to present a simple, fast, cheap, and precise method for diagnosing plant diseases. In this article, five corn leaf diseases (Southern Leaf Blight, Southern Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Holcus Spot, and Stewart’s Wilt) are diagnosed using image-processing techniques. After collecting and transferring the diseased leaves to the laboratory, the images of leaves are produced under controlled conditions of light. In the following, four different methods are used to diagnose the disease and then the results are analyzed and compared. In the first proposed method, the damaged areas are separated using histogram equalization method and then a two-layer perceptron neural network classification system is used to categorize the final results and diagnose the disease. In the second method, Laplacian and Canny filters are used to separate the damaged areas. In the third method, the principal components analysis method is used and finally in the fourth method, a combination of Gabor filter and visual features is used to diagnose the disease. The results demonstrate that the combination of Gabor filter and visual features could successfully classify the specified disease spots by means of neural network classification system with the average accuracy of 90.04%. © 2016, Scientific Publishers.

In MBO, there are mainly two processes. In the first process, the algorithm emulates how some of the butterflies move from the current position to the new position by the migration operator. In the latter process, the algorithm tunes the position of other butterflies by adjusting operator. In order to enhance the search ability of MBO, an innovation method called MBHS is introduced to tackle the optimization problem. In MBHS, the harmony search (HS) adds mutation operators to the process of adjusting operator to enhance the exploitation, exploration ability, and speed up the convergence rate of MBO. For the purpose to validate the performance of MBHS, 14 benchmark functions are used, and the performance is compared with well-known search algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MBHS performs better than the basic MBO and other algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.",butterfly optimization; Evolutionary computation; Harmony search,Algorithms; Benchmarking; Control systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Benchmark functions; Convergence rates; Harmony search; Innovation methods; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mutation operators; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Optimization,,,,,,,"Yang, X.-S., Firefly algorithm, stochastic test functions and design optimisation (2010) International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 2 (2), pp. 78-84; Michalewicz, Z., Fogel, D.B., (2013) How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics, , (Springer Science & Business Media, 2013); Van Laarhoven, P.J., Aarts, E.H., (1987) Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications, , (Springer Science & Business Media, 1987); Gandomi, A.H., Yang, X.-S., Alavi, A.H., Mixed variable structural optimization using firefly algorithm (2011) Computers & Structures, 89 (23), pp. 2325-2336; Sivanandam, S., Deepa, S., (2008) Genetic Algorithms: Introduction to Genetic Algorithms, pp. 15-37. , (Springer); Engelbrecht, A.P., (2006) Fundamentals of Computational Swarm Intelligence, , (John Wiley & Sons, 2006); Kennedy, J., (2010) Particle Swarm Optimization': 'Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, pp. 760-766. , (Springer); Ram, G., Mandal, D., Kar, R., Ghoshal, S.P., Optimal design of non-uniform circular antenna arrays using PSO with wavelet mutation (2014) International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 6 (6), pp. 424-433; Mirjalili, S., Wang, G.-G., Coelho, L.D.S., Binary optimization using hybrid particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (2014) Neural Computing and Applications, 25 (6), pp. 1423-1435; Wang, G.-G., Gandomi, A.H., Alavi, A.H., Deb, S., A hybrid method based on krill herd and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (2015) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-18; Wang, G.-G., Hossein Gandomi, A., Yang, X.-S., Hossein Alavi, A., A novel improved accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm for global numerical optimization (2014) Engineering Computations, 31 (7), pp. 1198-1220; Simon, D., Biogeography-based optimization (2008) Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on, 12 (6), pp. 702-713; Saremi, S., Mirjalili, S., Lewis, A., Biogeography-based optimisation with chaos (2014) Neural Computing and Applications, 25 (5), pp. 1077-1097; Li, X., Yin, M., Multiobjective binary biogeography based optimization for feature selection using gene expression data (2013) NanoBioscience, IEEE Transactions on, 12 (4), pp. 343-353; Wang, G.-G., Gandomi, A.H., Alavi, A.H., An effective krill herd algorithm with migration operator in biogeographybased optimization (2014) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 38 (9), pp. 2454-2462; Wang, G., Guo, L., Duan, H., Wang, H., Liu, L., Shao, M., Hybridizing harmony search with biogeography based optimization for global numerical optimization (2013) Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience, 10 (10), pp. 2312-2322; Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Colorni, A., Ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents (1996) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 26 (1), pp. 29-41; Krynicki, K., Jaen, J., Mocholí, J.A., Ant colony optimisation for resource searching in dynamic peer-to-peer grids (2014) International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 6 (3), pp. 153-165; Khatib, W., Fleming, P.J., The stud GA: A mini revolution?

Hard disk drive (HDD) has become popular for VOD storage to store and deal with a large amount of data. In practical cases, disk storage throughput is limited by a slow HDD and disk operating degrades drastically when the server needs to serve many simultaneous video streams. On the other hand, solid-state drive (SSD) are a appropriate features which does not has long access delay and support more IOPS that is greatly desirable for VOD storage. Unfortunately, using SSD to entirely replace HDD is not cost-effective. For this reason, hybrid storage is an economical way and offer better performance to treat with large scale VOD storage server. In this paper, SSD is divided into two different regions in size. The large part is used to store popular contents and the other is used as a buffer cache instead of RAM. The target of this research is to exploit fast access of SSD and its greater number of IOPS to maximize the number of simultaneously users and to minimize the service time. Experimental results of the proposed work enhance the response time for VOD storage server. © 2015 IEEE.",Disk bottleneck; Hybrid storage (HDD/SSD); Multimedia-on-demand (MOD); Video on demand (VOD); Video storage,Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Disks (machine components); Hard disk storage; Random access storage; Video streaming; Disk bottleneck; Hybrid storages; Multimedia on demand; Video on demands (VoD); Video storage; Video on demand,,,,,,,"Kasavajhala, V., Solid state drive vs. Hard disk drive price and performance study (2011) Proc.

In addition, the targets may overlap in cluttered scenes. In this paper, a real-time and high-precision method was presented for detecting moving targets in cluttered scenes. The Gaussian Mixture Model was used to obtain the moving regions. Then, a set of morphological operations were applied to locate the candidate targets. Moreover, the areas smaller than the threshold were eliminated. The targets were detected using Histograms of Oriented Gradient features extracted from training images, AdaBoost Cascade Classifier and the trained Support Vector Machines. The key points on the target image were located, and the Weighted Euclidean Distance and Kalman Filter were used to track the targets. The results showed that the proposed method tracked the targets with approximately 90% precision within 500 frames video captured at different hours during a day. Thus, this method delivered satisfactory results. © Research India Publications.",Adaboost; Cascade classifier; Detection; Histograms of oriented gradients; Kalman Filter; SVM; Visual tracking,,,,,,,,"Yilmaz, A., Javed, O., Shah, M., Object Tracking: A Survey (2006) ACM Comput Surv, 38, pp. 1-45; Tian, B., Li, Y., Li, B., Wen, D., Rear-View Vehicle Detection and Tracking by Combining Multiple Parts for Complex Urban Surveillance (2014) IEEE T INTELL TRANSP, 15, pp. 579-606; Choi, J.Y., Sung, K.S., Yang, Y.K., Multiple Vehicles Detection and Tracking based on Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (2007) Proc.

Most of these services use multi-tier architecture for flexible scaling and software reusability. However, managing the performance of multi-tier web services under dynamic and unpredictable workload, and different resource demands in each tier is a critical problem for a service provider. When offering quality of service assurance with least resource usage costs, web service providers should adopt self-adaptive resource provisioning in each tier. Recently, a number of rule- and model-based approaches have been designed for dynamic resource management in virtualized data centers. This survey investigates the challenges of resource provisioning and provides a competing assessment on the existing approaches. After the evaluation of their benefits and drawbacks, the new research direction to improve the efficiency of resource management and recommendations are introduced. © 2016 KSII.",Cloud computing; Multi-tier Application; Quality of service; Resource management,Client server computer systems; Cloud computing; Computer software reusability; Information management; Natural resources management; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Reusability; Surveys; Telecommunication services; Websites; Dynamic resource management; Model based approach; Multi tier architecture; Multi-tier applications; Quality of service assurances; Resource management; Virtualized data centers; Web service providers; Web services,,,,,,,"Douglas, Barry, K., (2003) Web Services, Service-Oriented Architectures, and Cloud Computing: The Savvy Manager's Guide, , Morgan Kaufmann Pub; Fielding, R.T., Kaiser, G., The Apache HTTP Server Project (1997) IEEE Internet Computing, 1 (4), pp. 88-90. , July, Article (CrossRef Link); Tomcat 6.0.44, , http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/; The Java Community Process Program, , http://jcp.org/en/introduction/overview; Menasc, D.A., Almeida, V.A.F., Dowdy Larry, W., (2002) Capacity Planning for Web Services: Metrics, Models, and Methods, , Prentice Hall PTR; Kleinrock, Leonard, (1976) Queuing Systems, 2. , Computer ApplicationsNY: Wiley; Chandra, A., Gong, W., Shenoy, P., Dynamic resource allocation for shared data centers using online measurements (2003) Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 381-398. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Article (CrossRef Link); Xiong, P., Wang, Z., Jung, G., Pu, C., Study on performance management and application behavior in virtualized environment (2010) Proc. of Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), 2010 IEEE, pp. 841-844. , Article (CrossRef Link); Urgaonkar, B., Pacifici, G., Shenoy, P., Spreitzer, M., Tantawi, A., An Analytical Model for Multi-Tier Internet Services and Its Applications (2005) Proc. of ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, 33, pp. 291-302. , Article (CrossRef Link); (2012), http://www.rackspace.com/; Wei, J., Cheng-Zhong, X., EQoS: Provisioning of client-perceived end-to-end QoS guarantees in web servers (2006) Computers, IEEE Transactions, 55 (12), pp. 1543-1556. , Article (CrossRef Link); Liu, X., Sha, L., Diao, Y., Froehlich, S., Hellerstein, J.L., Parekh, S., Online response time optimization of apache web server (2003) Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 461-478. , Article (CrossRef Link); Zhou, D., Huang, W.W., Using a fuzzy classification approach to assess e-commerce web sites: An empirical investigation (2009) ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), 9 (3), p. 12. , Article (CrossRef Link); Diao, Y., Hellerstein, J.L., Parekh, S., (2002) Optimizing quality of service using fuzzy controlManagement Technologies for E-Commerce and E-Business Applications, pp. 42-53. , Article (CrossRef Link); Lama, P., Zhou, X., Autonomic provisioning with self-adaptive neural fuzzy control for percentile-based delay guarantee (2013) ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), 8 (2), p. 9. , Article (CrossRef Link); Rao, J., Wei, Y., Gong, J., Cheng-Zhong, X., Qos guarantees and service differentiation for dynamic cloud applications (2013) Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions, 10 (1), pp. 43-55. , Article (CrossRef Link); Maurer, M., Brandic, I., Sakellariou, R., Self-adaptive and resource-efficient SLA enactment for cloud computing infrastructures (2012) Proc. of Cloud Computing (CLOUD), 2012 IEEE 5Th International Conference On, pp. 368-375. , Article (CrossRef Link); Lama, P., Zhou, X., Efficient server provisioning with control for end-to-end response time guarantee on multitier clusters (2012) Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions On, 23 (1), pp. 78-86. , Article (CrossRef Link); Wang, L., Jing, X., Zhao, M., Yicheng, T., Fortes, J.A.B., Fuzzy modeling based resource management for virtualized database systems (2011) Proc. of Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2011 IEEE 19Th International Symposium On, pp. 32-42. , Article (CrossRef Link); Martinez, J.F., Ipek, E., Dynamic multicore resource management: A machine learning approach (2009) Micro, IEEE, 29 (5), pp. 8-17. , Article (CrossRef Link); Tesauro, G., Jong, N.K., Das, R., Bennani, M.N., A hybrid reinforcement learning approach to autonomic resource allocation (2006) Proc. of Autonomic Computing, 2006.

Designing an automatic and intelligent system for early diagnosis can prevent the blindness in infants.However, the blood vessels in the retina of infants is less clear, hence the correct diagnosis of vessels is very difficult. In this study, first the pre-processing stage removes the noise of images, after that the images are divided into 16 × 16 windows and Gabor filter is applied to each sub-window. Energy and entropy are calculated for each sub-window, and finally these features are sent into a neural networkto determine whether the sub-window has a vessel or not.By counting the number of sub-windows containing vessel, the prematurenessand completeness of retina is determined. In this method, the mean accuracy of images that have been classified is 80.88% respectively.",Gabor filters; Retinal vessel extraction; Retinopathy of premature infants,,,,,,,,"McRitchie, I.N., Hart, P.M., Winder, R.J., Image registration and subtraction for the visualization of change in diabetic retinopathy screening (2006) Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 30, pp. 139-145; Yun, W.L., Rajendra Acharya, U., Venkatesh, Y., Chee, C., Min, L.C., Ng, E., Identification of different stages of diabetic retinopathy using retinal optical images (2008) Information sciences, 178, pp. 106-121; Matsopoulos, G.K., Asvestas, P.A., Delibasis, K.K., Mouravliansky, N.A., Zeyen, T.G., Detection of glaucomatous change based on vessel shape analysis (2008) Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 32, pp. 183-192; Castillo-Riquelme, M.C., Lord, J., Moseley, M.J., Fielder, A.R., Haines, L., Cost-effectiveness of digital photographic screening for retinopathy of prematurity in the United Kingdom (2004) International journal of technology assessment in health care, 20, pp. 201-213; Chaudhuri, S., Chatterjee, S., Katz, N., Nelson, M., Goldbaum, M., Detection of blood vessels in retinal images using twodimensional matched filters (1989) IEEE Trans on Med.

In general, the multimedia techniques consist of instant messages, audio, and video chatting services. However, users cannot phonetically communicate with each other unless they use the same chatting applications since each chatting application has its own control protocol to handle the call setup, the real time media transmission, and the call teardown sessions. The only way to enable the users to communicate phonetically using different chatting applications is to design a new architecture by proposing an interworking module between the control protocols used by the applications. The interworking module between at least two different protocols is a very critical issue as it solves the data transmission problems when using different chatting applications to create a voice call, and demonstrates that the voice conferencing between heterogeneous control protocols identifies the interest of combining the features and taking the advantages of more than one protocol in a single network. The two chosen protocols in this paper are: Inter-Asterisk exchange Protocol and the extension of extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol. Each protocol differs from the other one in many terms. Thus, this paper clarified the main differences between IAX Protocol and Jingle Protocol by doing a comparison in terms of registration, URI format, signals, transport methods, audio and control packets, bandwidth, scalability, functionality, services, etc. This comparison is due to define the common and the unique features to ease proposing the IAX-Jingle mapping architecture, signaling and media transfer modules.

However, VOD performance is limited by the relatively low bandwidth access and high HDD latency access, which increase dramatically when a VOD server receives a large number of simultaneous requests. By contrast, flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are an attractive alternative because these ensure fast access to an intensive reading system such as VOD. A flash-based SSD only stores popular videos to provide fast access for read-intensive workloads. Unfortunately, replacing the entire HDD with SSD is costly because of its high cost per gigabyte. Therefore, hybrid HDD storage and the small capacity of a flash-based SSD can provide high but cost-effective performance in relation to the storage subsystem of a VOD server. The main goal is to improve the performance of the VOD server by maximizing the number of concurrent user requests and minimizing startup latency in a cost-effective way. Experimental results show that the hybrid HDD storage with flash-based SSD provides better performance than the HDD-based system because it can reduce the average response time for a large-scale VOD storage server by approximately 52.44%. © 2015 IEEE.",Hard disk drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-state-drive (SSD); Video on demand (VOD),Big data; Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Drives; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Response time (computer systems); Software engineering; Concurrent users; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storages; Solid state drives (SSD); Storage subsystems; Video on demand services; Video on demands (VoD); Video-on-demand servers; Video on demand,,,,,,,"Huang, T.Y., Handigol, N., Heller, B., McKeown, N., Johari, R., Confused, timid, and unstable: Picking a video streaming rate is hard (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Internet Measurement Conference, pp. 225-238. , ACM; Yu, H., Zheng, D., Zhao, B.Y., Zheng, W., Understanding user behavior in large-scale video-on-demand systems (2006) Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGOPS/EuroSys European Conference on Computer Systems, 40 (4), pp. 333-344; Adhikari, V.K., Guo, Y., Hao, F., Hilt, V., Zhang, Z.L., A tale of three cdns: An active measurement study of hulu and its cdns (2012) Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), pp. 7-12. , IEEE; Rahiman, A.R., Sumari, P., Solid state disk: A new storage device for video storage server (2008) International Symposium on Information Technology, 4, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Rizvi, S.S., Chung, T.S., Data storage framework on flash memory based SSD RAID 0 for performance oriented applications (2010) The 2nd International Conference in Computer and Automation Engineering, 1, pp. 126-128. , IEEE; Liu, Y., Huang, J., Xie, C., Cao, Q., Raf: A random access first cache management to improve SSD-based disk cache (2010) Fifth International Conference on in Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS), pp. 492-500. , IEEE; Yoshii, T., Black, C., Chahal, S., (2009) Solid-State Drives in the Enterprise: A Proof of Concept, , http://download.intel.com/it/pdf/Solid, Intel white paper; Cho, Y., Kim, T., An efficient scheduling algorithm for NCQ within SSDs (2015) IEICE Electronics Express, , https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/elex/advpub/0/advpub_12.20150066/_pdf; Jacob, B., Ng, S., Wang, D., (2008) Memory Systems: Cache, DRAM, Disk, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers; An SSD Primer: Why SSDs Are Awesome, , http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/whitepaper/whitepaper01.html; Headquarters, I., (2011) Toshiba NAND Vs.

Penang, Malaysia","Load balancing is a crucial factor in IPTV delivery networks. Load balancing aims at utilizing the resources efficiently, maximizing the throughput, and minimizing the request rejection rate. The peer-service area is the recent architecture for IPTV delivery networks that overcomes the flaws of the previous architectures. However, it still suffers from the load imbalance problem. This paper investigates the load imbalance problem, and tries to augment the peer-service area architecture to overcome this problem. To achieve the load balancing over the proposed architecture, we suggest a new load-balancing algorithm that considers both the expected and the current load of both contents and servers. The proposed load-balancing algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage is the contents replication according to their expected load, while the second stage is the content-aware request distribution. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we have compared it with both the traditional Round Robin algorithm and Cho algorithm. The experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm outperforms the two other algorithms in terms of load balance, throughput, and request rejection rate. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",Content Distribution Network; Content replication scheme; IPTV; Load balancing algorithm; Peer-service area architecture; Request distribution; VoD,IPTV; Network architecture; Network management; Parallel architectures; Content distribution networks; Content replication; Load balancing algorithms; Request distributions; VoD; Algorithms,,,,,,,"Borzemski, L., Zatwarnicki, K., CDNs with global adaptive request distribution (2008) Proc. of the 12th Inter.

Virtual delivery networks, as a cost-effective alternative, tend to be the dominant delivery option in the near future due to its advantages for service providers. However, virtual networks provisioning is more complicated as it integrates resources allocation, resources diminishing, and content replication interdependently. In this paper, we investigate the problem of virtual IPTV delivery network provisioning over the recent architecture, peer-service area architecture. The Genetic Algorithm as an optimization tool has been used to find the optimal provisioning parameters including storage, bandwidth, and CPU consumption. The experiments have been conducted on two data sets with different popularity distributions. The experimental results showed the impact of content popularity on the provisioning process Copyright 2014 ACM.",Content popularity; Hybrid genetic algorithm; IPTV; VDN provisioning; Virtual delivery networks,Communication; Genetic algorithms; Information management; IPTV; Optimization; Content popularities; Content replication; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Network provisioning; Optimal provisioning; Popularity distribution; Resources allocation; VDN provisioning; Network architecture,,,,,,,"Nguyen, H.V., Safaei, F., Boustead, P., Chou, C.T., Provisioning overlay distribution networks (2005) Comput.

Most of the steganographic methods either use spatial domain or frequency domain for embedding the secret information. Current hybrid methods require the original cover image to extract the secret information making these methods to become not practical. This paper proposes a new blind steganographic method for digital images that combines spatial and frequency domains and does not rely on the cover image in extracting the secret information. The proposed method utilizes a chaotic map to scramble the secret information before the embedding procedure takes place. A coding map is generated during the work on spatial domain, and the original image is transformed into DWT domain, then the generated coding map is embedded in the coefficients of LL and HL sub-bands of the cover image. The drawn experimental results show that the resultant stego-images have high quality and the proposed method provides high embedding capacity compared with other methods and is robust against the visual analysis and other image processing attacks such as lossy compression and added noise. © 2013 Engineering and Technology Publishing.",Chaotic map; Frequency domain; Haar-DWT; Spatial domain; Steganography,Chaotic map; Embedding capacity; Embedding procedures; Frequency domains; Haar-DWT; Secret information; Spatial and frequency domain; Spatial domains; Chaotic systems; Digital storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Image compression; Steganography; Image coding,,,,,,,"Safy, R.E.L., Zayed, H., Dessouki El, A., An Adaptive Steganographic Technique Based On Integer Wavelet Transform (2009) Proc.

Content Distribution Networks (CDN) are used to solve this problem but the problem of load imbalance among servers still exists due to the dynamic changes in contents and user interests in an IPTV environment. In the VoD context, many content storage management architecture models are proposed: single point, hierarchal, distributed, and service peer area architectures. In the this paper we choose peer-service area architecture for CDN to study the load imbalance problem and try to handle it by modifying peer-service area architecture and proposing a balanced content allocation scheme that solves the load imbalance problem by replicating the contents based on their popularity. Experimental results show that this proposed allocation scheme can maintain the load balancing among servers and avoid over/under utilization of servers.",Balanced content allocation; CDN; Content allocation; Content popularity; IPTV; Load imbalance; Peer-service area architecture; VOD,,,,,,,,"Bisdikian, C., Patel, B., Cost-based program allocation for distributed multimedia-on-demand systems (1996) IEEE Multimedia, 3 (3), pp. 62-72. , doi:10.1109/93.556540; Cheng, J., Report: One-third of TV watching to be video-ondemand by 2012 (2007), http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/09/report-one-third-of-tv-watching-to-be-video-on-demandby-2012.ars, Report.

It is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer. Screening mammography is currently the most effective tool for early detection of breast cancer. For every thousand cases analyzed by a radiologist, only 3 to 4 are cancerous and the rest could be overlooked. The challenges basically come from the (1) A large variability in the appearance of abnormalities (masses) within digital mammogram made very difficult in image analysis (2) Presence of high dense breast tissues for fibroglandular tissue predominance such as mammogram of young woman which makes the distinction between normal glandular tissues and malignant disease is difficult, So it is very hard to detect the masses with an opaque uniform background and (3) hard to obtain data in an unstructured knowledge of previous screening history. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm by CBR (Case Based Reasoning Classification) based computerized mammogram mass detection for improving the accuracy rate of detection; the main aim of the paper is to show the evaluation results of CBR classification and make a comparative analysis with existing ANN classification method. © 2012 AICIT.",Case Base Reasoning and Aritificial Neural Network; Classification; Segmentation,Accuracy rate; ANN classification; Breast Cancer; Breast tissues; Case-base reasonings; CBr; Comparative analysis; Digital mammograms; Early detection of breast cancer; Effective tool; Evaluation results; Fibroglandular tissue; Glandular tissue; Lung Cancer; Malaysia; Malignant disease; Mass detection; Skin cancers; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Diseases; Histology; Image segmentation; Information management; Mammography; Tissue; X ray screens; Case based reasoning,,,,,,,"Fajardo, L.J., Williams, M.B., The Clinical Potential of Digital Mammography (1996) Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Digital Mammography, Chicago, USA, pp. 43-52; Bottigli, U., Massive Lesions Classification using Features based on Morphological Lesion Differences (2006) Proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, Greece, 12. , March; Wang, C.-M., Classification for Breast MRI Using Support Vector Machine (2009) 1nternational Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 9 (5). , May; Vibha, L., Harshavardhan, G.M., LESION DETECTION USING SEGMENTATION and CLASSIFICATION of MAMMOGRAMS Proceedings of 25th IASTED Conference on AI and Its Applications"", Austria, Feb 2007; Rabottino, G., Mass Contour Extraction in Mammographic Images for Breast Cancer Identification 16th IMEKO TC4 Symposium,Exploring New Frontiers of Instrumentation and Methods for Electrical and Electronic Measurements,Italy, Sep 2008; Valliappan, R., Sumari, P., Mohan, V., Then, P., Case Base Classification on Mammograms: Adding Weights and Improving the Performance of CBR Classifier IEEE ICGIP,Manila, Philippines,Dec 2010; Bishop, C.M., (1996) Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, , Oxford:Oxford University Press; Battiti, R., First and second order methods for learning:between steepest descent and Newton's method (1992) Journal of Neural Computing, 4, pp. l41-l66","Raman, V.; School of Engineering Computing and Science, , Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia; email: vraman@Swinburne.edu.my",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE);Inst.

However, it has two characteristics namely: 1) Out-place updating and 2) Cleaning process that affects its performance as an efficient storage sub-system. Both characteristics influence the access time requirement in enabling the continuity of data storing and updating. In this paper, we propose an efficient data allocation scheme that takes into account the data popularity as the main indicator in making the allocation decision. Then, we unveil the importance of the allocation scheme in the block cleaning algorithm process. The simulation studies have shown that the integration between the block cleaning algorithm and the proposed data allocation scheme has significant impact on the cleaning process performance in terms of the number of block erasure operation and the number of active block requirements. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",Algorithm; Allocation; Cleaning; Flash memory; Simulation,Access time; Active blocks; Allocation; Allocation decision; Block cleaning; Cleaning process; Data allocation; Data popularity; Data storing; Memory performance; Non-volatile; Number of blocks; Significant impacts; Simulation; Simulation studies; Sub-systems; Algorithms; Flash memory; Virtual storage; Cleaning,,,,,,,"Chang, L., Kuo, T., An efficient management scheme for large-scale flash-memory storage systems Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, , SAC '04, Nicosia, Cyprus, pp. 862-868, 2004; Breeuwsma, M., Jongh, M.D., Klaver, C., Knijff, R.V.D., Roeloffs, M., Forensic data recovery from flash memory (2007) Journal of Small Scale Digital Device Forensics, 1, pp. 1-17. , June; Lawton, G., Improved flash memory grows in popularity (2006) Computer, 39, pp. 16-18. , January; Douglis, F., Caceres, R., Kaashoek, F., Li, K., Marsh, B., Tauber, J.A., Storage alternatives for mobile computers Proc. 1 st Symp.

Numerous periodic VOD broadcasting protocols have been proposed to support a large number of receivers. Broadcasting is an efficient transmission scheme to provide on-demand service for very popular movies. This paper proposes a new broadcasting scheme called Popularity Cushion Staggered Broadcasting (PCSB). The proposed scheme improves the Periodic Broadcasting (PB) protocols in the latest mobile VOD system, which is called MobiVoD system. It also, reduces the maximum waiting time of the mobile node, by partitioning the 1 st segment of the whole video and storing it in the Local Media Forwarder (LMF) exactly in the Pool of RAM (PoR), and then transmitting them when the mobile nodes miss the 1 st broadcasted segment. The results show that the PCSB is more efficient and better than the all types of broadcasting and caching techniques in the MobiVoD system. Furthermore, these results exhibits that system performance is stable under high dynamics of the system and the viewer's waiting time are less than the previous system. © 2012 KSII.",MANET; PCSB; Periodic broadcast;

Data broadcasting algorithm plays an important role as it instructs the server to disseminate large amount of data at fast rate and send to many mobile clients. One of the work known as Broadcast Disk method is creating a sequence of slots containing data and broadcasting them in circular manner to the air. Mobile clients keep listening to the air and catch those slots that interest them. However based on Broadcast Disk method, some slots are empty, which results into bandwidth waste and client waiting time increment. Empty slots are randomly exists which difficult to locate. In this paper we enhance the Broadcast Disk method to overcome the empty slots aims to reduce the latency of users in accessing the service. We manage to locate these empty slots and fill them with popular data.

In this system, the video server employs staggered broadcasting protocol to disseminate video to mobile clients within the MANET environment. In this protocol, video is divided into small segments and are repeatedly broadcasted within server's channel in periodic basis. Clients can join any of the channels to receive the segments and begin to watch the video. The drawback of periodic broadcasting is it leads mobile clients to have a long waiting time (range in several minutes) due to the issue of channel transitions period. In this paper we focus on reducing the waiting time by proposing two caching schemes. This paper proposed first, a Neighbour-based caching scheme allows clients to get help from neighbour's buffer for the playback, and a Relay-based caching scheme uses middle clients to relay the video from client to another client. Simulation shows that our two caching schemes can reduce clients delay tremendously in comparison with the case of no caching scheme. © 2010 IEEE.",Mobile ad hoc; Periodic broadcast; Service delay; Video on demand system,Caching scheme; Channel transition; Hand held device; Mobile ad hoc; Mobile client; Mobile video; Periodic broadcasting; Periodic broadcasts; Service delays; Staggered broadcasting; Video on demand system; Video servers; Waiting-time; Computer graphics; Mobile ad hoc networks; Video streaming; Visualization; Video on demand,,,,,,,"Tran, D.A., Hua, M.K., MobiVod: A video on demand system design for mobile ad hoc networks (2004) Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM'04), pp. 118-126. , June; Alzoubi, K.M., Wan, P.-J., Frieder, O., Message-optimal connected dominating sets in mobile ad hoc networks (2002) Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking &amp (MobiHoc '02), pp. 157-164. , June; Bajaj, S., Breslau, L., Shenker, S., Uniform versus priority dropping for layered video (1998) ACM SIGCOMM, pp. 131-143; http://www.bluetooth.com/; Bradshaw, M.K., Wang, B., Sen, S., Gao, L., Kurose, J., Shenoy, P., Towsley, D., Periodic broadcast and patching services - Implementation, measurement, and analysis in an internet streaming video testbed (2001) Proceedings of the ACM International Multimedia Conference and Exhibition, 4, pp. 280-290; Cali, F., Conti, M., Gregori, E., IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN: Capacity analysis and protocol enhancement (1998) Proceedings of INFOCOM'98, pp. 142-149. , March; Camp, T., Boleng, J., Davies, V., A survey of mobility models for ad hoc network research (2002) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2 (5), pp. 483-502; Carter, S.W., Long, D.D.E., Improving bandwidth efficiency of video-on-demand servers (1999) Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 31 (1), pp. 99-111","Sumari, P.; Multimedia Computing Research Group, , Penang, Malaysia; email: putras@cs.usm.my",,,,"2010 7th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization, CGIV 2010",7 August 2010 through 10 August 2010,"Sydney, NSW",82042,,9.78077E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Most of these applications are desktop-based; only the desktop users can view regular contents and make conversation. The software we have developed is a LAN-based using client/server and Peer to peer architecture for transmitting and receiving multimedia contents. Such types of software already exist in the market, lacking the feature of portability and in result clients are bound to use Microsoft platform. Our paper expose this problem; LAN clients of this application can use any sort of platform, as they are based-Java also provides many other useful utilities for heterogeneous system such as voice and video Streaming and registry service and security issues are also considered. Totally work based on Java Technology environments, this project includes Custom Clients and Registry Server also persistency as well as database connectivity at backend. In particular in this work we have taken full advantage of Java's beauty by using Java Network Library and (JMF) Java Media Framework ,additional we have created lot of user define protocols to develop and facilitate developers to develop their own Multimedia based applications rapidly. © 2010 IEEE.",Media streaming; Multicast; Peer to peer (P2p); Plug-in proxy; Registry service; RTP; Video and audio transmission,Audio transmission; Multicasts; Peer to peer; Plug-ins; Registry service; Acoustic streaming; Audio streaming; Computer software portability; Information technology; Internet protocols; Java programming language; Multicasting; Peer to peer networks; Video streaming; Videotex; Media streaming,,,,,,,"Damien, S., Peer-to-Peer Streaming Media Delivery [Online], , www.robotarmy.com/dstolarz/P2PStreamingMediaDelivery.pdf, [Accessed 4th December 2007].

It has lots of attractive features such as small size and light weight nature, zero noise, solid-state reliability, low power consumption, and better shock resistant. However, its two hardware characteristics, namely, i) out-place updating and ii) garbage collection process are affecting flash memory performance if these characteristics are not well-organized. To overcome these constraints, we propose an efficient page allocation scheme that based on the occurrences of page data in the data access pattern. In the scheme, we have classified the page data into hot and cold data and allocated them into different blocks. The performance of the allocation scheme is confirmed by trace-driven simulations and the merit of the proposed scheme is justified in terms of a number of active block requirements. The number of active block requirement is reduced into 16% in comparison to the existing schemes. ©2009 IEEE.",Active block; Flash memory; Garbage collection; Trace-driven simulation,Active blocks; Consumer devices; Data access patterns; Data allocation; Data storage devices; Garbage collection; Hardware characteristics; Light weight; Low-power consumption; Page allocation; Small size; Trace driven simulation; Refuse collection; Waste disposal; Flash memory,,,,,,,"Douglis, F., Caceres, R., Kaashoek, F., Li, K., Marsh, B., Tauber, J.A., Storage alternatives for mobile computers (1994) Proc. 1st Symp.

Since humans tend to use high-level semantic concepts when querying and browsing multimedia databases, there is an increasing need for semantic video indexing and analysis. For this purpose, we proposed a unified framework for semantic extraction retrieval with motion vector analysis and color tracking model in sports video and also focus on clustering by aggregating shots or key-frames with similar low-level features, the proposed scheme employs supervised learning to perform a top-down video shot classification. This paper also focuses on the integration of multimodal features for sport video structure analysis. In this paper stochastic modeling and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that can be efficiently applied to merge audio and visual cues. Currently our approach is validated in the particular domain of tennis videos. For initial analysis we undergone a pilot prototype study with existing works and added up proposed methods, based on results achieved we further need to enhanced the framework. We are now in the stage of analyzing and formulating the problem solution for implementation in matlab. © 2009 IEEE.",Component; Semantic extraction; Shot classification and HMM's,Audio and visual cues; Color tracking; Digital media; High level semantics; Key-frames; Low-level features; Motion vector analysis; Multimedia database; Multimodal features; Semantic extraction; Semantic video indexing; Shot classification; Sport video; Sports video; Stochastic modeling; Tennis videos; Topdown; Unified framework; Video shot classification; Visual content; Digital storage; Electrical engineering; Feature extraction; Hidden Markov models; MATLAB; Object recognition; Stochastic models; Visual communication; Semantics,,,,,,,"Gong, Y., Sin, L.T., Chuan, C.H., Zhang, H., Sakauchi, M., Automatic Parsing of TV Soccer Programs (1995) Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems, pp. 167-174; Sudhir, G., Lee, J.C.M., Jain, A.K., Automatic Classification of Tennis Video for High-level Content-based retrieval (1998) Proc. of IEEE International Workshop on Content-Based Access of Image and Video Database, pp. 81-90; Ngo, C.-W., Pong, T.-C., Zhang, H.-J., On clustering and retrieval of video shots (2001) Proc. of ACM Multimedia, pp. 51-60; Assfalg, J., Bertini, M., Del Bimbo, A., Nunziati, W., Pala, P., Soccer Highlights Detection and Recognition Using HMMs Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo, 2002; Zhong, D., Chang, S.-F., Structure Analysis of Sports Video Using Domain Models Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo, 2001; Assfalg, J., Bertini, M., Colombo, C., Del Bimbo, A., Semantic annotation of sports videos (2002) IEEE Multimedia, 9 (2), pp. 52-60; Black, M.J., Anandan, P., The Robust Estimation of Multiple Motions: Parametric and Piecewise-smooth Flow Fields (1996) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 63 (1), pp. 75-104","Raman, V.; School of Computer Science, , Penang 11800, Malaysia; email: Vallimaster@yahoo.com",,International Association of Computer;Science and Information Technology (IACSIT),,"2009 International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering, ICCEE 2009",28 December 2009 through 30 December 2009,Dubai,79725,,9.78077E+12,,,English,"Int.

The reasons that make it become popular include small size and light weight nature, less noise, solid-state reliability, low power consumption, and better shock resistant. However, its two hardware characteristics, called out-place updating and garbage collection indirectly affect the performance of it superiority features. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a page allocation algorithm that based on page appearance regularity.

For a watermark to be useful, it must be perceptually invisible and robust against any possible attack and image processing by those who seek to corsair the material, researchers have considered various approaches like JPEG compression, geometric distortions and noising. Approach: We proposed a framework based on the Hartung technique which depended on spread spectrum communication in discrete cosine transform (DCT). Results: For the experimental results, researchers had considered various approaches: JPEG compression, geometric distortions and noising. Results showed a good performance in the proposed method. Conclusion: The presented technique was applicable not only to MPEG-2 video, but also to other DCT coding videos like MPEG-1,H261 and H263. Future study could be on improving DCT and comparing it with existing methods. It could be on discrete wavelet transform that is relatively new and has useful properties for the image processing applications. © 2009 Science Publications.",Data hiding; Geometric distortions; JPEG compression; Transform domain; Video; Watermarking,,,,,,,,"Voloshynovskiy, S., Pereira, S., Herrigel, A., Baumgartner, N., Pun, T., Generalized watermarking attack based on watermark estimation and perceptual remodulation (2000) Proceedings of the Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Content II Conference, p. 548. , http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1379132, Jan. 24-26, San Jose, CA, pp; Voloshynovskiy, S., Pereira, S., Pun, T., Eggers, J.J., Su, J.K., Attacks on digital watermarks: Classification, estimation based attacks and benchmarks (2001) IEEE.

In our study there are many fields concern with numbers, for example, checks in banks or recognizing numbers in car plates, the subject of digit recognition appears. A system for recognizing isolated digits may be as an approach for dealing with such application. In other words, to let the computer understand the Arabic numbers that is written manually by users and views them according to the computer process. Scientists and engineers with interests in image processing and pattern recognition have developed various approaches to deal with handwriting number recognition problems such as, minimum distance, decision tree and statistics. Approach: The main objective for our system was to recognize isolated Arabic digits exist in different applications. For example, different users had their own handwriting styles where here the main challenge falls to let computer system understand these different handwriting styles and recognize them as standard writing. Result: We presented a system for dealing with such problem. The system started by acquiring an image containing digits, this image was digitized using some optical devices and after applying some enhancements and modifications to the digits within the image it can be recognized using feed forward back propagation algorithm. The studies were conducted on the Arabic handwriting digits of 10 independent writers who contributed a total of 1300 isolated Arabic digits these digits divided into two data sets: Training 1000 digits, testing 300 digits.

In this paper, we present and discuss the uses of object oriented approach and UML paradigm for complex web hypermedia design. Our main objective is to propose a hypermedia design method, called Com+HDM, which is based on UML profile and its general extension mechanisms. We define and propose specific modeling elements, called stereotypes to model conceptual, navigational, and user interface aspects of complex web hypermedia applications. The novelty of our design method stands in the modeling concepts, stereotypes used, and design patterns of the modeling approaches.

Early detection is the key for improving breast cancer prognosis. Mammography has been one of the most reliable methods for early detection of breast carcinomas. However, it is difficult for radiologists to provide both accurate and uniform evaluation for the enormous mammograms generated in widespread screening. The CAD systems can provide such help and they are important and necessary for breast cancer control. Microcalcifications and masses are the two most important indicators of malignancy, and their automated detection is very valuable for early breast cancer diagnosis.

It provides users a service to browse and watch any video at any time with VCR (rewind, forward and pause) operations. One of the requirements for VOD system implementation is to have a VOD server that acts as an engine to deliver videos from the server's disk to users. Designing VOD server, particularly the video layout component on the server's disk, is an interesting issue as it determines the number of streams being delivered to users. Video blocks should be laid intelligently with less latency on disk and hence produce high number of streams. However, due to real time and large volume characteristics possessed by the video, the designing of video layout is a challenging task. Real time constraints the distribution of blocks on disk and hence decrease the number of streams being delivered to users. Another important aspect of designing video layout is the VCR operation service since it provides interactivity. It possesses the same challenge as in streaming videos to users as it consumes bandwidth of the server. In this paper we present a new video layout scheme for a VOD server called Disk-region storage scheme. The scheme partitions the disks into regions and uses a special algorithm to distribute blocks of video data within regions. The scheme is capable of producing a high number of streams as well as providing VCR operations to users. The simulation showed that the scheme increases the number of simultaneous stream by 15%.

One of the important components of this environment is the server with broadcasting capabilities. Data are fetched from the server and being broadcast to the air. Mobile users keep listening within the air and catch those data that interest him. In one of the work known as the Acharya algorithm (Acharya et al., 1995) has focused on developing algorithm for arranging the sequence order of data to be broadcasted. The work has generated the sequence of data to be broadcast with the policy of broadcasting more popular data compare to the less popular one. However, the work does not covers the overhead issue incurred by the disk during actual data retrieval task in order to satisfy the broadcasting order. In this paper, we present a data organization called sequence to be used as a data storing method in the server to support broadcasting environments. Our scheme, the sequence order of data to be stored on physical disk, is basically similar in pattern to the sequence order of data to be broadcasted. Having this approach the server's disk incurs less overhead (seek and latency). We show by simulation result that our scheme has reduced the overhead of Acharya scheme by average 60%. We also work on multiple disks with the same speed and configuration as opposed by the Acharya scheme, which used different disk speed and configuration. © 2003 IEEE.",Artificial satellites; Cellular networks; Communications technology; Information retrieval; Local area networks; Mobile communication; Mobile computing; Network servers; Satellite broadcasting; Wireless LAN,Broadcasting; Cellular telephone systems; Communication satellites; Geometry; Information retrieval; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Satellites; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Cellular network; Communications technology; Mobile communications; Network server; Satellite broadcasting; Local area networks,,,,,,,"Achary, S., Franklin, M., Zdonik, S., Alonso, R., Broadcast disks : Data management for asymmetric communications environments (1995) Proceedings of the ACCM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, San Jose, pp. 199-210. , May; Imielinski, T., Korth, H., (1996) Mobile Computing, p. 331. , Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York; Hameed, S., Vaidya, N., Efficient algorithm for scheduling data broadcast (1999) Wireless Networks, 5 (3), pp. 183-193; Barbara, D., Mobile Computing and Databases - A survey (1999) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 11 (1), pp. 108-117. , January/February; Dunham, M.H., Mobile Computing and Databases Tutorial of International Conference on Data Engineering, February 1998; Baruah, S., Bestavros, A., Pinwheel scheduling for fault-tolerant broadcast disk in real-time database systems (1997) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Data Eng.

In previous paper (Yew et al., 2003), we have shown a new method for embedding plain-texts using a complementary elliptic curve. In this paper we extend our work to obtain a new modified method for the Nyberg-Rueppel message recovery signature scheme using the complementary curve. By applying this method, we eventually enlarge the block of message of elliptic curve cryptosystems and this resulted in faster communication and processing time and at the same time the security level remain tight. © 2003 IEEE.",Communication system security; Computer science; Elliptic curve cryptography; Elliptic curves; Equations; Galois fields; H infinity control; Public key; Public key cryptography; Solid modeling,Authentication; Computational geometry; Computer control systems; Computer science; Cryptography; Geometry; Public key cryptography; Communication system security; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography; Equations; Galois fields; H -infinity controls; Public keys; Solid model; Curve fitting,,,,,,,"Diffie, W., Hellman, M., New Directions in Cryptography (1976) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 22, pp. 644-654; Koblitz, N., Elliptic Curves Cryptosystems (1987) Mathematics of Computation, 48 (177), pp. 203-209; Miller, V.S., Uses of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography (1986) Lecture Notes in Computer Since, 218, pp. 417-426. , Advances in Cryptology, CRYPTO'85 Proceedings; Silverman, J.H., (1986) The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Demytko, N., A New Elliptic Curve Based Analogue of RSA (1993) LNCS, 765, pp. 40-49. , Advances in Cryptology - Eurocrypt '93, Springer-Verlag; Borst, J., (1997) Public Key Cryptosystems Using Elliptic Curves, , Master Thesis, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Faculteit Wiskunde en Informatica; Koblitz, N., (1988) A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography, , Springer-Verlag, New York; ElGamal, T., A Public Key Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme Based on Discrete Logarithms (1985) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, IT-31 (4), pp. 469-472. , 1985; Nyberg, K., Rueppel, R., Message Recovery for Signature Schemes Based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem (1994) LNCS, 740, pp. 182-193. , Advances in Cryptology - Crypto'92, Springer-Verlag; Yew, T.C., Kamarulhaili, H., Sumari, P., Complementary elliptic curves for cryptographic used Proc.

VOD provides a service to users to browse and to watch any videos at any time. One of the most challenging aspects in designing VOD system is to design a data storage for VOD server with a capability of retrieving and transmitting different blocks of videos simultaneously to support simultaneous streams. Real time and latency characteristics are the major hurdles in devising server’s data storage for producing maximum number of simultaneous streams as well as reducing the average service waiting time. In this paper we present a new data storage scheme for VOD server that eliminates latency and hence producing maximum number of simultaneous streams. The scheme introduces a disk-region layout technique on an array of disks. The disk-region layout uses a residue class theory concept for overall mechanism of disk partition and data distribution within disks.

One of the most challenging aspects in such system is to have a VOD server with a capability of retrieving and transmitting different blocks of videos simultaneously. A part from this the VOD server should also capable of producing high number of simultaneous streams with a low average waiting time. In this paper we present a new data storage scheme employed by the VOD server to eliminate latency and hence producing maximum number of simultaneous streams. In this scheme the disk is divided into regions and blocks of video are scattered within the regions based on the residual theory rule. We also developed a stream caching technique for reducing the average waiting time of the system. © 2002 IEEE.,,Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Software engineering; Average waiting-time; Caching technique; Data storage; Video on demands (VoD); Video-on-demand servers; VOD servers; Video on demand,,,,,304/PKOMP/633114,,"Chang, E., Garcia-Molina, H., Reducing Initial Latency in Media Servers (1997) IEEE Multimedia, pp. 50-61. , Vol; Chang, C.K., Shih, C.-C., A circular skip-cluster scheme to support video-on-demand services.

Basically, VoD consists of a video server, interconnection network and user display equipment (UDE). It provides a similar service to the neighbourhood rental store. Videos or movies are distributed from the video server to users upon request through the network and users can view interactively using their UDE along with VCR-like functions (e.g. forward, rewind, pause and resume). VoD offers a convenient service since users do not have to leave their homes, which also leads to shorter response times than with today's video stores. One important aspect of any VoD is the storage scheme used, which affects the amount and type of storage required, the maximum number of concurrent video streams and the average waiting time experienced by users of the service from the moment they choose a video to the moment video playback starts. The paper reviews some well known storage schemes, such as the phase based method and the phase based with replication method, and then proposes two new schemes that further increase the number of concurrent streams and reduce the waiting time, while reducing the total storage space required. These new schemes rely on two concepts called immediate playback RAM and sustainable playback storage. Using a case study, the new schemes are briefly compared with an existing scheme and their strengths and shortcomings are highlighted. Using some typical values, analyzes are carried out that quantify the performance gain resulting from the new storage schemes.",,Client server computer systems; Computer systems programming; Interconnection networks; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Telecommunication services; Videocassette recorders; User display equipment (UDE); Video on demand,,,,,,,"Chang, Y., II.
