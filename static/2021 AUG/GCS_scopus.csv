Most BLE-based mesh protocols are implemented as overlays on top of the standard Bluetooth star topologies while using piconets and scatternets. Nonetheless, mesh topology support has increased the vulnerability of BLE to security threats, since a larger number of devices can participate in a BLE Mesh network. To address these concerns, BLE version 5 enhanced existing BLE security features to deal with various authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality issues. However, there is still a lack of detailed studies related to these new security features. This survey examines the most recent BLE-based mesh network protocols and related security issues. In the first part, the latest BLE-based mesh communication protocols are discussed. The analysis shows that the implementation of BLE pure mesh protocols remains an open research issue. Moreover, there is a lack of auto-configuration mechanisms in order to support bootstrapping of BLE pure mesh networks. In the second part, recent BLE-related security issues and vulnerabilities are highlighted. Strong Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for detecting security breaches in order to protect against zero-day exploits. Nonetheless, viable IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks remain a nascent research area. Consequently, a comparative survey of IDS approaches for related low-power wireless protocols was used to map out potential approaches for enhancing IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks. © 2020 by the authors.","BLE; Bluetooth low energy; IoT security; Wireless mesh networks","Bluetooth; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Low power electronics; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Security systems; Surveys; Topology; Auto-configuration; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Low power wireless; Reliable communication; Security protocols; Network security; bootstrapping; communication protocol; confidentiality; internet of things; review",,,,,,,,"Ghori, M.R., Wan, T.C., Sodhy, G.C., Bluetooth Low Energy 5 Mesh Based Hospital Communication Network (B5MBHCN) (2020) Advances in Cyber Security, 1132, pp. 247-261. , Springer: Singapore; Darroudi, S.M., Gomez, C., Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Networks: A Survey (2017) Sensors, 17, p. 1467. , [CrossRef] [PubMed]; Gohel, S., Bluetooth Attendance System with Android Application for ERP (2018) Proceedings of the International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON), pp. 481-484. , Greater Noida, India, 28–29 Septtember; Sthapit, P., Gang, H., Pyun, J., Bluetooth Based Indoor Positioning Using Machine Learning Algorithms Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Asia (ICCE-Asia), pp. 206-212. , Jeju, Korea, 24–26 June 2018; Yumantoro, G., Kristalina, P., Sudarsono, A., Performance Evaluation of Indoor Characteristic based on Bluetooth Low Energy Communication System through Statistical Approach Proceedings of the International Electronics Symposium on Engineering Technology and Applications (IES-ETA), pp. 189-195. , Bali, Indonesia, 29–30 October 2018; Handojo, A., Lim, R., Octavia, T., Anggita, K., Museum Interactive Information Broadcasting Using Indoor Positioning System and Bluetooth Low Energy: A Pilot Project on Trowulan Museum Indonesia Proceedings of the 3rd Technology Innovation Management and Engineering Science International Conference (TIMES-iCON), pp. 1-5. , Bangkok, Thailand, 12–14 December 2018; Sunardy, A., Surantha, N., Performance Evaluation of Indoor Positioning Algorithm using Bluetooth Low Energy Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 503-507. , Bandung, Indonesia, 22–26 October 2018; Mohsin, N., Payandeh, S., Ho, D., Gelinas, J.P., Bluetooth Low Energy Based Activity Tracking of Patient Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV), pp. 1991-1996. , Singapore, 18–21 November 2018; Giovanelli, D., Farella, E., Fontanelli, D., Macii, D., Bluetooth-Based Indoor Positioning Through ToF and RSSI Data Fusion Proceedings of the International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), pp. 1-8. , Nantes, France, 24–27 September 2018; Jung, C., Kim, K., Seo, J., Silva, B., Han, K., Topology Configuration and Multihop Routing Protocol for Bluetooth Low Energy Networks (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 9587-9598. , [CrossRef]; Leonardi, L., Patti, G., Lo Bello, L., Multi-Hop Real-Time Communications Over Bluetooth Low Energy Industrial Wireless Mesh Networks (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 26505-26519. , [CrossRef]; Bluetooth Vulnerabilities, , https://thehackernews.com/2020/02/hacking-bluetooth-vulnerabilities.html, (accessed on 20 February 2020); https://docs.zephyrproject.org, Zephyr Projects.

For WAHN, there are many available technologies such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Threads, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) etc. Despite of the improvements in IoT technologies, multicasting pure mesh-based routing is still a major problem that needs to be resolved. In view of the aforesaid, this research will propose a multicast mesh-based communication network architecture and protocol having topology autoconfiguration features. Subsequently, for this study, the use case will be the hospital (being the most critical place dealing with emergencies). Furthermore, for the aforesaid use case, the BLE is supposed to be the most suitable technology being low power and easily available (in smart phone and gadgets). Initially, the BLE was introduced in Bluetooth version 4.0 and its features got matured in the advance version 4.2 and 5. BLE 5 has the capability for mesh topology that has increased the network coverage and enhanced end to end diversity of the Bluetooth based ad-hoc networks. Likewise, in this paper, the emphasis will be on proposing a pure mesh-based routing protocol capable of multicasting and topology autoconfiguration for BLE 5 enabled network for the hospital. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ad-hoc network; BLE 5; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Hospital; Mesh network","Ad hoc networks; Bluetooth; Hospitals; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Multicasting; Network architecture; Smartphones; Topology; Auto-configuration; BLE 5; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Bluetooth-based; Internet of thing (IOT); Mesh topologies; Network coverage; Low power electronics",,,,,,,,"Balogh, A., Service mediation in multi-hop Bluetooth low energy networks based on NDN approach (2015) Proceedings of the Twenty Third International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks, Croatia, pp. 285-289. , pp; Bluetooth Sig, Bluetooth Low Energy, , http://www.bluetooth.com/, Accessed 28 Oct 2018; Cabra, J., An IoT approach for wireless sensor networks applied to e-health environmental monitoring (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (Ithings), pp. 578-583. , pp; Celia, G.H., IoT heterogeneous mesh network deployment for human-in-the-loop challenges towards a social and sustainable industry 4.0 (2018) IEEE Access J, 6, pp. 28417-28437; Chen, D., S2M: A lightweight acoustic fingerprints based wireless device authentication protocol (2017) IEEE Iot J, 4 (1), pp. 88-100; Chuang, Y.H., A lightweight continuous authentication protocol for the Internet of Things (2018) Sens.

Moreover, the technologists are doing research to make WMN more reliable and secure. Subsequently, among wireless ad-hoc networking technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is gaining high degree of importance among researchers due to its easy availability in the gadgets and low power consumption. BLE started its journey from version 4.0 and announced the latest version 5 with mesh support capability. BLE being a low power and mesh supported technology is nowadays among the hot research topics for the researchers. Many of the researchers are working on BLE mesh technology to make it more efficient and smart. Apart from other variables of efficiency, like all communication networks, mesh network security is also of a great concern. In view of the aforesaid, this paper provides a comprehensive review on several works associated to the security in WMN and BLE mesh networks and the research related to the BLE security protocols. Moreover, after the detailed research on related works, this paper has discussed the pros and cons of the present developed mesh security mechanisms.

The NDN, and previously content-centric networking (CCN), has been considered as the enabler to address various Internet of Things (IoT) challenges, with the potential to outperform the current IP paradigm in many dimensions. The requirements and challenges of the IoT, imposed by constraints, such as limited memory and computational power, while requiring high energy efficiency in the face of unstable network connectivity, impose extra burdens on the IP paradigm. The named content, in-network caching and named-based routing approach in the CCN and NDN provide promising solutions to overcome these constraints and showcase alternative implementations. This paper aims to investigate and demonstrate the current incorporation of the NDN/CCN with the IoT in terms of in-network caching management, naming scheme for devices and data, access control and policies, forwarding strategies, device configuration, and discovery. © 2013 IEEE.","CCN; content-centric networking; ICN; information-centric networking; Internet of Things; named data networking; NDN","Access control; Energy efficiency; Information management; Internet of things; Content-centric networkings; Device configurations; Forwarding strategies; Future internet architecture; High energy efficiency; Information-centric networkings; Internet of Things (IOT); Named data networkings; Internet protocols",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

NDN originated from an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) [5], which Van Jacobson proposed at Xerox PARC. This information-based model retrieves content by name without directly mapping the content to host locations, and at the same time achieves better performance, scalability, and security. Both NDN and CCN are considered as Information-Centric Networking (ICN) [6]–[8] instances, similar to previous ICN oriented projects such as DONA [9], COMET [10], and PSIRP [11]. They natively support multicasting, mobility, and in-network caching. In contrast to the host-centric IP-based networking approach, content in CCN/NDN is an integral part of the network. According to Van Jacobson [5], every CCN node specifies what to search for but not where the information is located, unlike the IP-based paradigm. Any authorized consumer can acquire the data using a unique name (self-identifying), and the data can be authenticated with a signature (self-authenticating).

However, this system causes some user pains and problems, i.e. high capital investment, setup and maintenance hassle, lack of flexibility and reliability, and data security and privacy concern. Cloud computing as an emerging technology is used for developing a cloud-based POS software named RetailNow. A cloud service provider is in charge of delivering and maintenances of the software to retailers based on their environments. The provider is also responsible for security and privacy of data on its servers. Due to the pay-per-use subscription model of the cloud, retailers also save in their finance. The retailers only require a basic computer and an internet connection in order to connect to RetailNow. RetailNow is targeted for all scales and environments of retail outlets. The purpose of the study is to understand the influential factors that impact on intention to use RetailNow among retailers in Malaysia. The proposed model is the combination of the TOE and the TAM to obtain applicability and predictive power. In order to test the proposed model, a quantitative study using a self-administrated survey will be directed. A research method which is based on the multi-analytical approach of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is applied which enables extra verification of the results provided by the PLS-SEM for direct relationships in the model. We only apply PLS-SEM for testing the mediation effect. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","ANN; Cloud-based POS; PLS-SEM; RetailNow; SaaS; TAM; The Point of Sale (POS) system; TOE","Data privacy; Investments; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Soft computing; Cloud service providers; Cloud-based; Data security and privacy; Partial least square (PLS); Point of sale; RetailNow; SaaS; Structural equation modeling; Sales",,,,,,,,"Blokdijk, G., (2015) Point of sale—simple Steps to Win, Insights and Opportunities for Maxing out Success; Margaret Weber, M., Prasad Kantamneni, S., POS and EDI in retailing: An examination of underlying benefits and barriers (2002) Supply Chain Manag, 7 (5), pp. 311-317; Tolbert, F., Why point of sales data matters for demand management (2009) J.

The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness. We introduce a generic and flexible structured document model to represent heterogeneous structured documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections. We also illustrate how the proposed model can be utilized in structured document retrieval. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Contextual constraints; Document collection; Document structure; Representation model; Semantic correspondence; Structured document; Structured document retrieval; Semantic Web; Semantics; Stairs; User interfaces; Information retrieval",,,,,,,,"Barbosa, D., Mignet, L., Veltri, P., Studying the xml web: Gathering statistics from an xml sample (2006) World Wide Web, 9 (2), pp. 187-212; Denoyer, L., Gallinari, P., The wikipedia xml corpus (2006) SIGIR Forum, 40 (1), pp. 64-69; Gabriella, K., Antoine, D., Monica, L., Overview of the inex 2008 book track (2008) Advances in Focused Retrieval 7th International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX, pp. 106-123. , Dagstuhl Castle, Germany: Springer-Verlag; Schenkel, R., Suchanek, F., Kasneci, G., Yawn: A semantically annotated wikipedia xml corpus (2008) Proceedings of Datenbanksysteme in Business, Technologie und Web, BTW, pp. 277-291. , Aachen, Germany; Van Zwol, R., Van Loosbroek, T., Effective use of semantic structure in xml retrieval (2007) Proceedings of the 29th European Conference on IR Research, ECIR, pp. 621-628; Schlieder, T., Meuss, H., Querying and ranking xml documents (2002) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, JASIST, 53 (6), pp. 489-503; Trotman, A., Searching structured documents (2004) Information Processing and Management, 40 (4), pp. 619-632; Trotman, A., Sigurbjrnsson, B., Narrowed extended xpath i (nexi) (2004) Advances in XML Information Retrieval and Evaluation: 3rd International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX, pp. 16-40. , Dagstuhl Castle, Germany; Carmel, D., Maarek, Y.S., Mandelbrod, M., Mass, Y., Soffer, A., Searching xml documents via xml fragments (2003) Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Informaion Retrieval, SIGIR, pp. 151-158. , Toronto, Canada: ACM; Schenkel, R., Theobald, A., Weikum, G., Semantic similarity search on semistructured data with the XXL search engine (2005) Information Retrieval, 8 (4), pp. 521-545; Rijsbergen, C.J.V., (1979) Information Retrieval, , 2nd ed.

Structured retrieval makes use of both content and structure of documents to improve information retrieval. Therefore, the availability of semantic structure in the documents is an important factor for the success of structured retrieval. However, the majority of documents in the Web still lack semantically-rich structure. This motivates us to automatically identify the semantic information in web documents and explicitly annotate the information with semantic tags. Based on the well-known Wikipedia corpus, this paper describes an unsupervised learning approach to identify conceptual information and descriptive information of an entity described in a Wikipedia article. Our approach utilizes Wikipedia link structure and Infobox information in order to learn the semantic structure of the Wikipedia articles. We also describe a lazy approach used in the learning process. By utilizing the Wikipedia categories provided by the contributors, only a subset of entities in a Wikipedia category is used as training data in the learning process and the results can be applied to the rest of the entities in the category.

But they are missing the ingredients to being proactively engaged in the area of identifying blackhats' state of affairs like recording their activities, as and when they try to break in, how they break in, tools or tactics used as of when they are successful or what are their motives when they succeed and so forth. Honeynet gives us the possibilities to obtain early warnings of what may come along the way that could eventually become real threats to our valuable network resources and their continuity of operations. This paper focuses on using multiple layers of Data Control and Data Capture mechanisms in making Honeynet a great architecture to achieve this objective. We implement multiple Data Control mechanisms to contain and control intruders and let them know only what we want them to know. And at the same time, we capture the intruders' activities without them knowing it using multiple Data Capture mechanisms.","Honeynet; Honeypot; Honeywall; Virtual honeynet; Virtualization","Computer architecture; Intrusion detection; Resource allocation; Data capture mechanisms; Honeynet; Honeypot; Honeywall; Virtual honeynet; Computer system firewalls",,,,,,,,"(2004) Know Your Enemy: Learning About Security Threats, , The Honeynet Project, 2nd edition Addison-Wesley; Grimes, R.A., (2005) Honeypots for Windows, , Apress; Baumann, R., (2003) Honeyd - A low involvement Honeypot in Action, , http://security.rbaumann.net/download/honeyd.pdf, URL; Clark, M., (2001) Virtual Honeynets, , http://www. securityfocus.eom/infocus/1506, Nov 7, URL; Levine, J.G., Grizzard, J.B., Owen, H.L., Using Honeynets to Protect Large Enterprise Networks (2004) IEEE Security and Privacy, 2 (6), pp. 73-75; Gonzalez Gómez, D., (2004), http://www.honeynet.org.es/ papers/vhwall, Installing a Virtual Honeywall Using VMWare, Spanish Honeynet Project, November 14, URL; Oudot, L., (2004) Wireless Honeypot Trickery, SecurityFocus, , http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1761, February, URL; F.

It provides an opportunity to harness a lot of idle peer-resources such as desktop computers across the Internet, for solving large-scale computing applications. Each peer is autonomous and it needs incentive for sustained contribution of its resources to P2P applications. In addition, a flexible and efficient job scheduling is needed to harvest the idle computing power as cheaply and economically as possible. This paper introduces an economic based job scheduler for mapping jobs to resources in P2P computing environment. The scheduler has been implemented with the Compute Power Market (CPM) system developed using Sun JXTA P2P technology. Our scheduler can be configured depending on users' quality of service requirements such as the deadline and budget constraints. Our scheduler follows a hierarchy scheme. The design allows multiple consumers and multiple providers to schedule and run jobs. To allow wider support for a wide variety of applications, the system is designed to allow easy 'plug in' of user applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,"Budget control; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Personal computers; Quality of service; Scheduling; Social networking (online); Budget constraint; Computing power; Large-scale computing; P2P applications; P2P technologies; Peer-to-peer computing; Peer-to-peer computing systems; Web based computing; Peer to peer networks",,,,,,,,"Shikey, C., What is P2P⋯ And What Isn't (2000), http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/11/24/shirky1-whatisp2p.html, O'Reilly Network.

However; there is plenty of idle computational power not being used efficiently since most of this power resides on individual machines, only waiting to be harnessed in an orderly manner. Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology provides the infrastructure and methodology of using this idle power which is otherwise not fully utilized. Compute Power Market (CPM) has been proposed to bring together the providers and users of computing power in a systematic manner. This paper discusses our effort at developing a CPM/P2P framework, based on JXTA which is one of the latest P2P technology. We have managed to develop some essential modules needed to bring together providers and consumers of computational power.","Compute Power Market; JXTA; Resource Trading","Bandwidth; Internet; Problem solving; Resource allocation; Servers; Web browsers; Compute power market; Resource trading; Distributed computer systems",,,,,,,,"Buyya, R., Vazhjudai, S., Compute Power Market: Towards a Market-Oriented Grid (2001) The First IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGrid 2001), , Brisbane, Australia, May 15-18; http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu, SETI@home; Buyya, R., Abramson, D., Giddy, J., Nimrod/G: An Architecture for a Resource Management and Scheduling System in a Global Computational Grid Nimrod/G (2002) The 4th International Conference on High Performance Computing in AsiaPacific Region (HPC Asia 2000), , Beijing, China; Baker, M., Buyya, R., Laforenza, D., The Grid: International Efforts in Global Computing (2000) International Conference on Advances in Infrastructure for Electronic Business, Science, and Education on the Internet (SSGRR 2000), , ÍAquila, Rome, Italy, July 31 - August 6; Buyya, R., Giddy, J., Abramson, D., A Case for Economy Grid Architecture for Service-Oriented Grid Computing (2001) 10th IEEE International Heterogeneous Computing Workshop (HCW 2001), , in conjunction with IPDPS 2001, San Francisco, California, USA, April; Gong, L., JXTA all about community (2001) The O'Reilly Peer-to-Peer and Web Services Conference, , Washington D.C., USA, Sept 18-21; Gong, L., Project JXTA: A Technology Overview (2001) Project JXTA Documentation, , http://www.sun.com/software/jxta/jxta-doc.html, April 25; Amir, Y., Awerbuch, B., Borgstrom, R.S., The Java Market: Transforming the Internet into a Metacomputer (1998) Technical Report, CNDS-98-1. , Johns Hopkins University; Gnutella, , http://www.gnutella.co.uk/; Bearshare, , http://www.bearshare.com/; Limewire, , http://www.limewire.com/; Morpheus, , http://www.morpheus-os.com/; Ripeanu, M., Foster, I., Iamnitchi, A., Mapping the Gnutella Network: Properties of Large-Scale Peer-to-Peer Systems and Implications for System Design (2002) IEEE Internet Computing Journal, 6 (1); JXTA, , http://www.jxta.org; Project JXTA: An Open, Innovative Collaboration (2001) Project JXTA Documentation, , http://www.sun.com/software/jxta/jxta-doc.html, April 25","Ling, A.W.K.; School of Computer Science, , 11800 Penang, Malaysia","Sahni S.","IASTED",,"Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Computer Science and Technology","19 May 2003 through 21 May 2003","Cancun",62490,,0889863490,,,"English","Proc.
