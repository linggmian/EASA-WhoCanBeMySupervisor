These devices, collectively, might possess an enormous amount of valuable data but due to privacy concerns and privacy laws like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this enormous amount of very valuable data is not available to train models for more accurate and efficient AI applications. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a very prominent collaborative learning technique to learn from such decentralized private data while reasonably satisfying the privacy constraints. To learn from such decentralized and massively distributed data, federated learning needs to overcome some unique challenges like system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, communication, model heterogeneity, privacy, and security. In this article, to begin with, we explain some fundamentals of federated learning along with the definition and applications of FL. Subsequently, we further explain the unique challenges of FL while critically covering recently proposed approaches to handle them. Furthermore, this paper also discusses some relatively novel challenges for federated learning. To conclude, we discuss some future research directions in the domain of federated learning. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

Ontology is one of the major cornerstones of representing the information in a more meaningful way on the semantic Web. The current ontology repositories are quite limited either for their scope or for currentness. In addition, the current ontology extraction systems have many shortcomings and drawbacks, such as using a small dataset, depending on a large amount predefined patterns to extract semantic relations, and extracting a very few types of relations. The aim of this paper is to introduce a proposal of automatically extracting semantic concepts and relations from scientific publications. This paper introduces a novel relevance measurement for concepts, and it suggests new types of semantic relations. Also, it points out of using deep learning (DL) models for semantic relation extraction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Concept extraction; Deep learning; Ontology construction; Relevance measurements; Semantic relation discovery,Extraction; Large dataset; Ontology; Ontology Extraction; Ontology repositories; Scientific publications; Semantic concept; Semantic relation extractions; Semantic relations; Types of relations; Unstructured data; Deep learning,,,,,,,"Mishra, S., Jain, S., A study of various approaches and tools on ontology (2015) IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), pp. 57-61. , , pp. , 2015; Maimon, O., Browarnik, A., Ontology learning from text: Why the ontology learning layer cake is not viable (2015) Int.

DL lies in image-based detection and instance segmentation of an entity, which is a critical issue that needs further investigation. This paper aims to study the fundamental challenges in using object instance segmentation of images. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for multi-object image instance segmentation algorithm in three stages. A novel backbone approach improves the image recognition algorithm by extracting low and high characteristic levels from the given images in the first stage. The ResNet is the fundamental building block and connects with the Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) for each ResNet block. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) is used to determine the object item’s placement, followed by the third stage, which suggests an average position RoI layer to choose the optimal boundaries of the instance segmentation. The experiments are conducted and validated using a standard benchmark image dataset, called COCO. The proposed algorithm’s performance is validated using standard evaluation criteria and compared against the recent image segmentation algorithms that use object instances. The results show that the proposed algorithm gets better results than other well-known instance segmentation algorithms in terms of average accuracy over IoU (AP) threshold measures using various thresholds. © 2021, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

Closely related to the third dimension of depth, this operation can be accomplished using human vision, though considered challenging due to the various issues when using computer vision. The differences in the geometry, the texture of the scene, the occlusion scene boundaries and the inherent ambiguity exist because of the minimal information that could be gathered from a single image. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel depth estimation in the field of architecture, which includes the stages that can manage depth estimation from a single RGB image. An encoder-decoder architecture has been proposed, based on the improvement yielded from DenseNet that extracted the map of an image using skip connection technique. This paper also takes on the reverse Huber loss function that essentially suits our architecture hand driven by the value distributions that are commonly present in depth maps. Experimental results have indicated that the depth estimation architecture that employs the NYU Depth v2 dataset has a better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods that tend to have fewer parameters and require fewer training time. © 2020, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

Ontology learning (OL) from text is a process that aims to (semi-) automatically extract and represent the knowledge from text in machine-readable form. Ontology is considered one of the main cornerstones of representing the knowledge in a more meaningful way on the semantic web. Usage of ontologies has proven to be beneficial and efficient in different applications (e.g. information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering). Nevertheless, manually construction of ontologies is time-consuming as well extremely laborious and costly process. In recent years, many approaches and systems that try to automate the construction of ontologies have been developed. This paper reviews various approaches, systems, and challenges of automatic ontology construction from the text. In addition, it also discusses ways the ontology construction process could be enhanced in the future by presenting techniques from shallow learning to deep learning (DL). © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Concept classification; Deep learning; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Semantic relation,Ontology; Semantic Web; Automatic ontology; Concept classification; Explosive growth; Machine readable form; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Question Answering; Semantic relations; Deep learning,,,,,,,"Abney, S., Part-of-speech tagging and partial parsing (1997) Corpus-based methods in language and speech processing, pp. 118-136. , Young S, Bloothooft G, (eds), 2, Springer, Netherlands; Albukhitan, S., Helmy, T., Alnazer, A., Arabic ontology learning using deep learning (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence, , Paper presented at the, Leipzig, Germany; Arel, I., Rose, D.C., Karnowski, T.P., Deep machine learning—a new frontier in artificial intelligence research [research frontier] (2010) IEEE Comput Intell Mag, 5, pp. 13-18; Arguello Casteleiro, M., Maseda Fernandez, D., Demetriou, G., Warren, R., Fernandez-Prieto, M.J., des Diz, J., Nenadic, G., Robert, S., (2017) A Case Study on Sepsis Using Pubmed and Deep Learning for Ontology Learning.

The proposed framework consists of four steps. Firstly, multi food image enhancement using image processing to handle different sizes of the image. Secondly, improve the recognition algorithm through the proposed novel backbone to extract low and high levels of features. Thirdly, locate the item of food using Region Proposal Network (RPN). Finally, develop a new technique called Max RoI layer, to get the best boundaries for the multi food image in the instance segmentation. The proposed method is validated by an experimental study on creating dataset has 27000 images were collected and annotated to train this deep learning (DL)-based algorithm to identify the multi foods in images, and the results are compared with the latest algorithm in object instance segmentation, they are Mask R-CNN, YOLACT, and CASCADE R-CNN. The proposed framework achieves better performance about the accuracy AP with different thresholds (AP 50, AP 75, AP 90 ), which are all higher than those of three frequently used methods—the Mask R-CNN, YOLACT, and CASCADE R-CNN. The training time proposed method is also slightly lower than the other methods. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

To enhance the performance of MBO algorithm, harmony search (HS) is introduced as a mutation operator during the adjusting operator of MBO. A novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization method, the so-called HMBO, is introduced to find the best solution for the global optimization problems. HMBO combines HS exploration with MBO exploitation, and therefore, it produces potential candidate solutions. The implementation process for enhancing MBO method is also presented. To evaluate the effectiveness of this improvement, fourteen standard benchmark functions are used. The mean and the best performance of these benchmark functions in 20, 50, and 100 dimensions demonstrated that HMBO often performs better than the original MBO and other population-based optimization algorithms such as ACO, BBO, DE, ES, GAPBIL, PSO and SGA. Moreover, the t-test result proved that the performance differences between the enhanced HMBO and the original MBO as well as the other optimization methods are statistically significant. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Evolutionary computation; Harmony search; Monarch butterfly optimization; Optimization,Benchmarking; Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Global numerical optimizations; Global optimization problems; Harmony search; Hybrid Meta-heuristic; Implementation process; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Optimization algorithms; Population-based optimization; Ant colony optimization,,,,,,,"Yang, X.S., (2010) Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, , Luniver press, Frome; Michalewicz, Z., Fogel, D.B., (2013) How to solve it: modern heuristics, , Springer, Berlin; Van Laarhoven, P.J., Aarts, E.H., Simulated annealing (1987) Simulated annealing theory and applications, pp. 7-15. , Springer, Netherlands; Wang, G., Guo, L., Wang, H., Duan, H., Liu, L., Li, J., Incorporating mutation scheme into krill herd algorithm for global numerical optimization (2014) Neural Comput Appl, 24 (3-4), pp. 853-871; Gandomi, A.H., Yang, X.S., Talatahari, S., Alavi, A.H., (2013) Metaheuristic applications in structures and infrastructures, , Newnes, Oxford; Yang, X.S., Deb, S., Hanne, T., He, X., Attraction and diffusion in nature-inspired optimization algorithms (2015) Neural Comput Appl, 24, pp. 1-8; Ouaarab, A., Ahiod, B., Yang, X.S., Discrete cuckoo search algorithm for the travelling salesman problem (2014) Neural Comput Appl, 24 (7-8), pp. 1659-1669; Yang, X.S., Gandomi, A.H., Talatahari, S., Alavi, A.H., (2012) Metaheuristics in water, geotechnical and transport engineering, , Newnes, Oxford; Horst, R., Tuy, H., (2013) Global optimization: deterministic approaches, , Springer, Berlin; Ding, S., Zhang, Y., Chen, J., Jia, W., Research on using genetic algorithms to optimize Elman neural networks (2013) Neural Comput Appl, 23 (2), pp. 293-297; Mitchell, M., (1998) An introduction to genetic algorithms, , MIT press, Cambridge; Zhao, M., Ren, J., Ji, L., Fu, C., Li, J., Zhou, M., Parameter selection of support vector machines and genetic algorithm based on change area search (2012) Neural Comput Appl, 21 (1), pp. 1-8; Khatib, W., Fleming, P.J., The stud GA: A mini revolution?

The team formation algorithm is designed in a way that it would continuously search for resources with better performance and pool resources together to achieve better availability. The main intention of this work is not to replace the human administrators but to provide a better alternative in managing services in dynamic distributed environment. Instructions from the administrators are still required but at a different level. Administrators are freed from making low level decisions such as to decide the actual placement of the services and design the failover capabilities for each of the services. The evaluation results showed that the framework is capable of managing resources according to the requirements given by administrator, even during in the event of multiple consecutive resources failure. The proposed solution had the probability of 72.1% of its services that are still available after 83.3% of the available resources were shut down while conventional failover solution using three redundant units had only the probability of 40.8% of services that are still available. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The Dynamic Service Placement and Replication (DSPR) framework is designed to manage services on distributed environment by repetitively searching for the best combination of distributed machines from a resource pool until the best working group is attained to satisfy the requirements of the service. In this research, a fuzzy logic based resource evaluation technique is proposed for the DSPR framework. The proposed technique is then compared with existing resource evaluation methods such as rule-based, utility-based and constraint-based. Besides that, the ability of DSPR to increase service availability in the event of multiple continuous failures is measured. The performance difference between using DSPR and conventional system with failover capability in the event of disaster was carried out. These experiments justify the suitability of using the proposed resource evaluation techniques compare to the existing work. © 2011 IEEE.",dynamic service placement and replication; fuzzy logic; resource evaluation; service availability,Constraint-based; Conventional systems; Core components; Distributed environments; Dynamic services; Failover; Resource evaluation; Resource selection; Rule based; Service availability; Working groups; Fuzzy logic,,,,,,,"Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Zaharia, M., A view of cloud computing Commun.

However, most of these algorithms aim to improve service performance or to reduce operation cost and do not consider the reliability and availability of their resources. Most of them do not consider events when machines in their resource pool malfunction. These malfunctioned machines could cause services to halt or, worse, to produce transient and intermittent errors. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic service placement and redundancy (DSPR) concept to manage service placement and replicas to achieve high availability and that is capable of detecting and recovering from arbitrary faults. The DSPR algorithm will autonomously look for opportunities to ensure service availability by migrating services to hosts with better performance and availability. The concept, research methodology and potential evaluation techniques are included. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.",autonomic computing; resource availability; resource management; service placement,Arbitrary faults; Autonomic Computing; Distributed environments; Dynamic services; High availability; Operation cost; Placement algorithm; Potential evaluation; Reliability and availability; Research directions; Research methodologies; resource availability; Resource management; Service availability; Service performance; service placement; Algorithms; Lakes; Redundancy; Multimedia services,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Tuecke, S., The anatomy of the grid: Enabling scalable virtual organizations (2001) International J.

These malfunctioned machines could cause services to halt or, worse, to produce transient and intermittent errors. Presently, most of the solutions proposed to improve service availability are based on having redundancy units that do not consider the amount of work and resources needed to create replicas, which greatly increases the complexity of the management of a distributed system. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art techniques that could improve service availability in distributed environments and propose an autonomic algorithm based on team building concept that dynamically performs service placement to improve service availability even in the event of resource failures. © 2010 IEEE.",Autonomic computing; Resource availability; Resource management; Service placement,Autonomic Computing; Distributed environments; Distributed systems; Dynamic services; Operation cost; Placement algorithm; Reliability and availability; Resource availability; Resource management; Service availability; Service performance; Service placement; Team building; Information technology; Lakes; Natural resources management; Quality assurance; Redundancy; Resource allocation; Algorithms,,,,,,,"Kephart, J.O., Research challenges of autonomic computing (2005) Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, , ACM: St. Louis, MO, USA; Sterritt, R., Autonomic computing (2005) Innovations Systems Software Engineering, 1 (1), pp. 79-88; Samuel, K., Ramon, N., Jordi, T., Autonomic QoS-Aware resource management in grid computing using online performance models (2007) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools, , ICST (Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering): Nantes, France; Folino, G., Spezzano, G., An autonomic tool for building self-organizing Grid-enabled applications (2007) Future Gener.

The features of agents including autonomous and distributed are designed to address the federation problems in grid, such as resource selection and policy reconciliation. Early work of resource federation is still highly depending on resource administrator (a person who manages the resources for corresponding institute). In this paper, automated agent negotiation in grid is presented to maximize the satisfaction level of federation outcome for involving parties. Using a new conflict resolution techniquecreative negotiation, is introduced in solving communication problems during negotiation. A framework of automated negotiation with conflict resolutionselect, match, negotiate and expand (SMNE) protocol, is proposed to guide resource administrators in performing resource federation with intelligent agent. According to the experimental result, the proposed SMNE protocol is able to guide resource administrator in conflict resolution when negotiated parties are unable to make further a concession in resource federation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Resource prediction can be used to enhance scheduler effectiveness on their scheduling strategies and resource allocation. The prediction results can also be used by the applications to adjust themselves to suit the resource availability to get better performance. In this paper, we use a suffix tree to discover CPU usage patterns to find opportunities for exploiting the available CPU resources. We introduced a prediction strategy that uses discovered frequent patterns to predict CPU load. We defined that a CPU usage behavior as a set of CPU usage patterns. Our experiment results showed that CPU usage does exhibit certain behavior and our model is capable of discovering the usage and utilized it to perform prediction. The discovered patterns are interesting because some of the discovered cyclic patterns seem to be related to users' usage behaviour. In order to justify our model prediction capability, we compared our prediction model with the state-of-the-art methods such as Network Weather Services. © 2006 IEEE.",,CPU resources; Cyclic patterns; Distributed frameworks; Experiment results; Frequent patterns; In order; international conferences; model predictions; multimedia applications; prediction modeling; resource availabilities; Resource prediction; Resource-sharing; Scheduling strategies; State-of-the-art methods; Suffix trees; Usage patterns; Weather services; Arts computing; Computer networks; Distributed computer systems; Mathematical models; Metropolitan area networks; Multimedia systems; Neodymium; Network protocols; Planning; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Forecasting,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., (1998) The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastucture, , Morgan Kufmann; Lingyun Yang, Jennifer M.

For this reason, resource selection has been a challenging task especially in meeting user's demand for a quality of service (QoS). A quality of service is the ability to serve a job by providing quality and reliable resource in fulfilling the user's need. Quality and reliable resource selections naturally yield excellent and quality results. The background of the users and where the resource belongs to are important in determining the quality of a resource. This paper concerns with efficient and quality-based resource discovery using Condor ClassAd and PageRank technique in order to achieve a quality resource matching. The paper discusses how quality of users and resources are determined and considered in the discovery process prior to allocating jobs to resources. © 2006 IEEE.",,Customer satisfaction; Distributed computer systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Grid environment; Quality resource matching; Resource discovery; Resource allocation,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C.G., (1999) The Grid: Blueprint for a Future Computing Infrastructure, , Morgan Kaufmann; Ridings, C., Shishigin, M., (2002) PageRank Uncovered; Brin, S., Page, L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine (1998) Proceedings of the 7th World Wide Web Conference, , http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html, Brisbane, Australia; Page, L., Brin, S., Motwani, R., Winograd, T., The pagerank citation algorithm: Bringing order to the web (1998) Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on World Wide Web, , Brisbane, Australia, April; Thain, D., Tannenbaum, T., Livny, M., (2003) Condor and the Grid, , Fran Berman, Anthony J.G.

The nature of the application which allows the whole docking jobs to be broken up into multiple small independent tasks, has the potential of utilizing the availability of the Grid computing. Using the web interface, the whole docking procedures can be automated from the start to the end. Automation includes the preparation of the target receptor, creation of parameter files (gpf and dpf), calculation of grid energy, and docking of molecules. Once the job is split into small tasks, the tasks are submitted to Globus GRAM that submits the tasks to the resources available in the Grid environment. The execution of the grid-enabled AutoDock 3.05 is tested and the results showed that the process of molecular docking are faster compared if the execution is run on sequential computing resources.",AutoDock 3.01; Distributed computing; Drug design; Grid computing; Molecular docking,Automation; Drug products; File organization; Random access storage; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Distributed computing; Drug screening; Grid computing; Molecular docking; Natural sciences computing,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., (1999) The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, USA; Akaho, E., Morris, G., Goodsell, D., Wong, D., Olson, A., (2001) Journal of Chemical Software, 7 (3), pp. 103-114; Elizabeth, A.L., Computing in drug discovery: The design phase IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering Magazine, , http://computer.org/cise/homepage/2001/O5Ind/O5ind.htm; http://www.globus.org","Tantoso, E.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800, Penang, Malaysia",,,Ohmsha Ltd.,,,,,2883635,,NGCOE,,English,New Gener Comput,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642337029
