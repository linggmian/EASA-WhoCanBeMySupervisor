Most BLE-based mesh protocols are implemented as overlays on top of the standard Bluetooth star topologies while using piconets and scatternets. Nonetheless, mesh topology support has increased the vulnerability of BLE to security threats, since a larger number of devices can participate in a BLE Mesh network. To address these concerns, BLE version 5 enhanced existing BLE security features to deal with various authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality issues. However, there is still a lack of detailed studies related to these new security features. This survey examines the most recent BLE-based mesh network protocols and related security issues. In the first part, the latest BLE-based mesh communication protocols are discussed. The analysis shows that the implementation of BLE pure mesh protocols remains an open research issue. Moreover, there is a lack of auto-configuration mechanisms in order to support bootstrapping of BLE pure mesh networks. In the second part, recent BLE-related security issues and vulnerabilities are highlighted. Strong Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for detecting security breaches in order to protect against zero-day exploits. Nonetheless, viable IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks remain a nascent research area. Consequently, a comparative survey of IDS approaches for related low-power wireless protocols was used to map out potential approaches for enhancing IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks. © 2020 by the authors.","BLE; Bluetooth low energy; IoT security; Wireless mesh networks","Bluetooth; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Low power electronics; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Security systems; Surveys; Topology; Auto-configuration; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Low power wireless; Reliable communication; Security protocols; Network security; bootstrapping; communication protocol; confidentiality; internet of things; review",,,,,,,,"Ghori, M.R., Wan, T.C., Sodhy, G.C., Bluetooth Low Energy 5 Mesh Based Hospital Communication Network (B5MBHCN) (2020) Advances in Cyber Security, 1132, pp. 247-261. , Springer: Singapore; Darroudi, S.M., Gomez, C., Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Networks: A Survey (2017) Sensors, 17, p. 1467. , [CrossRef] [PubMed]; Gohel, S., Bluetooth Attendance System with Android Application for ERP (2018) Proceedings of the International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON), pp. 481-484. , Greater Noida, India, 28–29 Septtember; Sthapit, P., Gang, H., Pyun, J., Bluetooth Based Indoor Positioning Using Machine Learning Algorithms Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Asia (ICCE-Asia), pp. 206-212. , Jeju, Korea, 24–26 June 2018; Yumantoro, G., Kristalina, P., Sudarsono, A., Performance Evaluation of Indoor Characteristic based on Bluetooth Low Energy Communication System through Statistical Approach Proceedings of the International Electronics Symposium on Engineering Technology and Applications (IES-ETA), pp. 189-195. , Bali, Indonesia, 29–30 October 2018; Handojo, A., Lim, R., Octavia, T., Anggita, K., Museum Interactive Information Broadcasting Using Indoor Positioning System and Bluetooth Low Energy: A Pilot Project on Trowulan Museum Indonesia Proceedings of the 3rd Technology Innovation Management and Engineering Science International Conference (TIMES-iCON), pp. 1-5. , Bangkok, Thailand, 12–14 December 2018; Sunardy, A., Surantha, N., Performance Evaluation of Indoor Positioning Algorithm using Bluetooth Low Energy Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 503-507. , Bandung, Indonesia, 22–26 October 2018; Mohsin, N., Payandeh, S., Ho, D., Gelinas, J.P., Bluetooth Low Energy Based Activity Tracking of Patient Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV), pp. 1991-1996. , Singapore, 18–21 November 2018; Giovanelli, D., Farella, E., Fontanelli, D., Macii, D., Bluetooth-Based Indoor Positioning Through ToF and RSSI Data Fusion Proceedings of the International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), pp. 1-8. , Nantes, France, 24–27 September 2018; Jung, C., Kim, K., Seo, J., Silva, B., Han, K., Topology Configuration and Multihop Routing Protocol for Bluetooth Low Energy Networks (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 9587-9598. , [CrossRef]; Leonardi, L., Patti, G., Lo Bello, L., Multi-Hop Real-Time Communications Over Bluetooth Low Energy Industrial Wireless Mesh Networks (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 26505-26519. , [CrossRef]; Bluetooth Vulnerabilities, , https://thehackernews.com/2020/02/hacking-bluetooth-vulnerabilities.html, (accessed on 20 February 2020); https://docs.zephyrproject.org, Zephyr Projects.

Source routing in MANETs is subject to some issues such as changes in the network topology, which lead to frequent link breakages that may increase the requests of route discoveries. Thus, this paper aims to enhance on-demand source routing protocols by proposing two mechanisms, a zone-based route discovery mechanism (ZRDM) and a link failure prediction mechanism (LFPM). ZRDM aims to control the flooding of route requests, and LFPM aims to avoid route breakages caused by node mobility. The performance of the proposed mechanisms was evaluated using network simulator 3 in terms of normalized routing load, average end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio. The experimental results showed that the proposed mechanisms outperform well-known mechanisms such as the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol, reliable DSR, and zone-based DSR and segment-based DSR. © 2013 IEEE.","DSR; MANET; routing overhead; RREQ; source routing protocol","Failure (mechanical); Network routing; Routing protocols; Telecommunication links; Average end-to-end delays; Dynamic Source Routing Protocol; MANET; Route discovery mechanism; Routing overheads; RREQ; Source routing protocols; Wireless mobile ad-hoc networks; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PNA/6316271","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) through the Bridging Research Grant under Grant 304/PNA/6316271.",,"Conti, M., Giordano, S., Mobile ad hoc networking: Milestones, challenges, and new research directions (2014) IEEE Commun.

For WAHN, there are many available technologies such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Threads, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) etc. Despite of the improvements in IoT technologies, multicasting pure mesh-based routing is still a major problem that needs to be resolved. In view of the aforesaid, this research will propose a multicast mesh-based communication network architecture and protocol having topology autoconfiguration features. Subsequently, for this study, the use case will be the hospital (being the most critical place dealing with emergencies). Furthermore, for the aforesaid use case, the BLE is supposed to be the most suitable technology being low power and easily available (in smart phone and gadgets). Initially, the BLE was introduced in Bluetooth version 4.0 and its features got matured in the advance version 4.2 and 5. BLE 5 has the capability for mesh topology that has increased the network coverage and enhanced end to end diversity of the Bluetooth based ad-hoc networks. Likewise, in this paper, the emphasis will be on proposing a pure mesh-based routing protocol capable of multicasting and topology autoconfiguration for BLE 5 enabled network for the hospital. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ad-hoc network; BLE 5; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Hospital; Mesh network","Ad hoc networks; Bluetooth; Hospitals; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Multicasting; Network architecture; Smartphones; Topology; Auto-configuration; BLE 5; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Bluetooth-based; Internet of thing (IOT); Mesh topologies; Network coverage; Low power electronics",,,,,,,,"Balogh, A., Service mediation in multi-hop Bluetooth low energy networks based on NDN approach (2015) Proceedings of the Twenty Third International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks, Croatia, pp. 285-289. , pp; Bluetooth Sig, Bluetooth Low Energy, , http://www.bluetooth.com/, Accessed 28 Oct 2018; Cabra, J., An IoT approach for wireless sensor networks applied to e-health environmental monitoring (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (Ithings), pp. 578-583. , pp; Celia, G.H., IoT heterogeneous mesh network deployment for human-in-the-loop challenges towards a social and sustainable industry 4.0 (2018) IEEE Access J, 6, pp. 28417-28437; Chen, D., S2M: A lightweight acoustic fingerprints based wireless device authentication protocol (2017) IEEE Iot J, 4 (1), pp. 88-100; Chuang, Y.H., A lightweight continuous authentication protocol for the Internet of Things (2018) Sens.

This paper focuses on the discovery of an optimal multi-hop path between a source (CH) and a destination (BS) to reduce power consumption, which shall maximize network lifetimes, by proposing a new Optimal Multi-hop Path Finding Method (OMPFM). A genetic algorithm is utilized in the proposed method to find an optimal path by proposing a new fitness function. Moreover, two pre-processes are proposed to select the CHs and increase the efficiency of the genetic algorithm in terms of the execution time and the quality of the chromosomes. The evaluation of the proposed method is conducted in MATLAB simulator and compared with other related methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than LEACH, GCA, EAERP, GAECH and HiTSeC by 35%, 34%, 26%,19% and 50%, respectively, in terms of the first node die metric, and by 100%, 99%, 87%, 78% and 50%, respectively, in terms of the last node die metric. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-hop path; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks","Electric power utilization; Genetic algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Critical factors; Energy efficient; Enhanced genetic algorithms; Fitness functions; Matlab simulators; Multi-hop path; Network efficiency; Network lifetime; Energy efficiency",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PNAV/6316271","This research was supported by the Bridging Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/6316271 .",,"Al-Shalabi, M.A., Anbar, M., Obeidat, A., Alternating sensing process to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (2019) J.

IoT devices in DTN generate and store data until a network link is available for data transmission. Data mules or ferries are scheduled to travel among intermittent networks to collect data and disseminate configuration updates from control centers to all participating nodes in a reliable manner. The incorporation of efficient, reliable multicast algorithms into DTN helps to overcome the current limitations in updating large numbers of nodes in remote areas with identical configurations. In this paper, the current state of multicast routing protocols in DTN is outlined according to their design aspects. Open issues are also discussed to provide impetus for further research into the Reliable Multicast DTN (RMDTN) protocol. © 2019 by the authors.

Since the performance of LEACH deteriorates sharply with increasing network size, the challenge for new WSN protocols is to extend the network lifespan while maintaining high scalability. This paper introduces an energy-efficient clustering and hierarchical routing algorithm named energy-efficient scalable routing algorithm (EESRA). The goal of the proposed algorithm is to extend the network lifespan despite an increase in network size. The algorithm adopts a three-layer hierarchy to minimize the cluster heads' load and randomize the selection of cluster heads. Moreover, EESRA uses multi-hop transmissions for intra-cluster communications to implement a hybrid WSN MAC protocol. This paper compares EESRA against other WSN routing protocols in terms of network performance with respect to changes in the network size. The simulation results show that EESRA outperforms the benchmarked protocols in terms of load balancing and energy efficiency on large-scale WSNs. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; LEACH; load balancing; scalability; wireless sensor networks","Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Low power electronics; Medium access control; Power management (telecommunication); Resource allocation; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Scalability; Energy efficient; Energy Efficient clustering; Hierarchical routing algorithm; High scalabilities; Intra-cluster communication; Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchies; Multihop transmission; Wsn routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).",,"Liu, X., Atypical hierarchical routing Protocols for wireless sensor net-works: A review (2015) IEEE Sensors J., 15 (10), pp. 5372-5383. , Oct; Gherbi, C., Aliouat, Z., Benmohammed, M., A survey on clustering routing Protocols in wireless sensor networks (2017) Sens.

The NDN, and previously content-centric networking (CCN), has been considered as the enabler to address various Internet of Things (IoT) challenges, with the potential to outperform the current IP paradigm in many dimensions. The requirements and challenges of the IoT, imposed by constraints, such as limited memory and computational power, while requiring high energy efficiency in the face of unstable network connectivity, impose extra burdens on the IP paradigm. The named content, in-network caching and named-based routing approach in the CCN and NDN provide promising solutions to overcome these constraints and showcase alternative implementations. This paper aims to investigate and demonstrate the current incorporation of the NDN/CCN with the IoT in terms of in-network caching management, naming scheme for devices and data, access control and policies, forwarding strategies, device configuration, and discovery. © 2013 IEEE.","CCN; content-centric networking; ICN; information-centric networking; Internet of Things; named data networking; NDN","Access control; Energy efficiency; Information management; Internet of things; Content-centric networkings; Device configurations; Forwarding strategies; Future internet architecture; High energy efficiency; Information-centric networkings; Internet of Things (IOT); Named data networkings; Internet protocols",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

NDN originated from an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) [5], which Van Jacobson proposed at Xerox PARC. This information-based model retrieves content by name without directly mapping the content to host locations, and at the same time achieves better performance, scalability, and security. Both NDN and CCN are considered as Information-Centric Networking (ICN) [6]–[8] instances, similar to previous ICN oriented projects such as DONA [9], COMET [10], and PSIRP [11]. They natively support multicasting, mobility, and in-network caching. In contrast to the host-centric IP-based networking approach, content in CCN/NDN is an integral part of the network. According to Van Jacobson [5], every CCN node specifies what to search for but not where the information is located, unlike the IP-based paradigm. Any authorized consumer can acquire the data using a unique name (self-identifying), and the data can be authenticated with a signature (self-authenticating).

For this purpose the efficiency of each protocol was analyzed to verify their behavior in non-uniform node density environments to determine the protocol which is more efficient on the basis of average end to end delay and normalized routing load (NRL). Network Simulation (NS-2) is applied to evaluate the protocols performances. The experiment results show that: CBRP protocol outperformed DSR and AODV in terms NRL when traffic sources greater than 20 sources and AODV outperforms DSR and CBRP in terms Average Delay for all traffic sources where AODV achieved the lowest delay. In addition, when node speed increases, the performance of (AODV, DSR and CBRP) protocols decreases. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","AODV; CBRP; DSR; MANET; Non-uniform; Routing protocols","Computer vision; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Robotics; Routing protocols; Ad hoc on demand distance vector; AODV; Average end-to-end delays; CBRP; Cluster based routing protocols; MANET; Non-uniform; Normalized routing loads; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM

Direct transmission problem, when a CH sends its data directly to the BS, causes a rapid drain of energy in CHs that are far from the BS. Several studies have been proposed to address this problem by finding intermediate nodes between the CH and the BS, but they suffer from many problems such as the complexity and considering just one parameter to select the intermediate nodes. This paper proposed a new mechanism to find the optimal multi-hop path for data transmission from a CH to the BS by utilizing the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed mechanism aims to increase the network lifetime by reducing the consumed energy in the data transmission process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Data transmission; Genetic Algorithm; LEACH protocol; Multi-hop path","Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Sensor nodes; Soft computing; Critical factors; Intermediate node; Leach protocols; Mechanism-based; Multi-hop path; Network efficiency; Network lifetime; Transmission problem; Data communication systems",,,,,,,,"Abed, A., Alkhatib, A., Baicher, G.S., Wireless sensor network architecture (2012) International Conference on Computer Networks and Communication Systems (CNCS 2012), 35, pp. 11-15. , IACSIT Press, Singapore; Pantazis, N.A., Nikolidakis, S.A., Vergados, D.D., Energy-efficient routing protocols in wireless sensor networks: A survey (2013) IEEE Commun.

The main objective of the project is to enable Southeast Asian universities to develop a new kind of accessible, affordable, high-quality, and effective educational services to various targeted groups across the region, which are often excluded from traditional educational outreach. The MOOC technology was chosen as the tool most promising and suitable for the region with regard to its particular characteristics: namely, growing population dispersed across thousands of islands and separated by thousands of kilometres and high growth of ICT penetration enabling modern ICT-based education. The COMPETEN-SEA project particularly focuses on three underprivileged communities, each representing one of the three Southeast Asian countries which are taking part in the project:","Abstract—This Paper explores the current use of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as a means of educational outreach among identified remote populations in Southeast Asia.

A WSN comprises a number of sensor nodes that are randomly spread in a specific area for sensing and monitoring physical attributes that are difficult to monitor by humans, such as temperature, fire, and pressure. Many problems, including data transmission, power consumption and selecting cluster heads, may occur due to the nature of WSNs. Various protocols have been conducted to resolve these issues. Most of the proposed protocols are based on the Genetic Algorithm as an optimization technique to select the Cluster Heads (CHs) or to find a multi-hop path for sending the data from the CHs to the Base Station (BS). This paper presents a comprehensive study of the protocols for WSNs that are proposed to come up with these issues. This study emphasises on CHs selection protocols and multi-hop path finding protocols and their strengths and weaknesses. A new taxonomy is presented to discuss these protocols on the basis of different classes. A complete comparison of the main features and behaviors of the protocols is conducted. This study will give basic guidelines for the researchers those have a motivation to develop a new CHs selection protocol or a multi-hop path finding protocol. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Radio communication; Sensor nodes; Cluster head; Different class; Modern technologies; Multi-hop path; Optimization techniques; Specific areas; Genetic algorithms",,,,,,,,"Al-Shalabi, M., Anbar, M., Wan, T.C., Khasawneh, A., Variants of the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol: Survey, issues and challenges (2018) Electronics, 7, p. 136; Abbasi, A., Younis, M., A survey on clustering algorithms for wireless sensor networks (2007) Computer Communications, 30, pp. 2826-2841; Norouzi, A., Zaim, H., Genetic algorithm application in optimization of wireless sensor networks (2014) The Scientific World Journal; Kumar, M., Husian, M., Upreti, N., Gupta, D., Genetic algorithm: Review and application (2010) International Journal of Information Technology and Knowledge Management, 2, pp. 451-454; Yang, Q., Yang, X., Wang, Y., An, D., A strategy based on cooperative transmission for minimizing delivery delay in WSN (2013) International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2013; Zhou, R., Chen, M., Feng, G., Liu, H., He, S., Genetic clustering route algorithm in WSN (2010) Natural Computation, 8, pp. 4023-4026; Liu, W., Wu, Y., Routing protocol based on genetic algorithm for energy harvesting-wireless sensor networks (2013) IET Wireless Sensor Systems, 3, pp. 112-118; Sivanandam, S.N., Genetic algorithm implementation using matlab (2008) Introduction to Genetic Algorithms, p. 453; Warrier, M., Kumar, A., An energy efficient approach for routing in wireless sensor networks (2016) Procedia Technology, 25, pp. 520-527; Song, Y., Gui, C., Lu, X., Chen, H., Sun, B., A genetic algorithm for energy-efficient based multipath routing in wireless sensor networks (2015) Wireless Personal Communications, 85, p. 2055; Balamurugan, A., An energy efficient fitness based routing protocol in wireless sensor networks (2014) Ictact Journal on Communication Technology, 5; Song, Y., Gui, C., Lu, X., Chen, H., Sun, B., A genetic algorithm for energy-efficient based multipath routing in wireless sensor networks (2015) Wireless Personal Communications, 85, p. 2055; Yao, G., Dong, Z., Wen, W., Ren, Q., A routing optimization strategy for wireless sensor networks based on improved genetic algorithm (2016) Journal of Applied Science and Engineering, 19, pp. 221-228; Khalil, E.A., Attea, B.A., Energy-aware evolutionary routing protocol for dynamic clustering of wireless sensor networks (2011) Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 1, pp. 195-203; Lu, Y., Wong, V., An energy-efficient multipath routing protocol for wireless sensor networks (2006) International Journal of Communication Systems, 23, pp. 633-652; Baranidharan, B., Santhi, B., Gaech: Genetic algorithm based energy efficient clustering hierarchy in wireless sensor networks (2015) J.

VANET networks do not depend on a fixed structure where vehicles moving very fast, which can result in frequent link breakages. Thus, routing protocols must be efficient and reliable to ensure data delivery, indeed, forwarding strategy is considered the core part of routing protocol where it is responsible for path selection. In literature, several works have been proposed to improve the performance of routing and forwarding strategies over vehicular networks. The main problem of current works is that they did not consider the main impact factors such as relative velocity between two connected vehicles, vehicle density, and channel condition. Therefore, this paper presents a review of the most related work in the field of forwarding strategy over VANET. A new classification of forwarding strategy is presented in this paper based on the selection parameters. Each classification presents a comprehensive review to identify the weaknesses and strengths points using examples. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Forwarding strategies; Geographic (position-based) routing protocol; V2V and V2I communications; Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs)",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 1001/PKOMP/811336, 304/PNAV/650694/E114, 304/PNAV/650817/C127","This research is funded in part via Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Grants 304/PNAV/650817/C127 , 304/PNAV/650694/E114 and 1001/PKOMP/811336 .",,"Jeremiah, C., Nneka, A.J., Issues and possibilities in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) (2015) 2015 International Conference on Computing, Control, Networking, Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineering (ICCNEEE); Moharrum, M.A., Al-Daraiseh, A.A., Toward secure vehicular ad-hoc networks: a survey (2012) IETE Tech.

A WSN comprises a number of sensors that are randomly spread in a specific area for sensing and monitoring physical attributes that are difficult to monitor by humans, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. Many problems, including data routing, power consumption, clustering, and selecting cluster heads (CHs), may occur due to the nature of WSNs. Various protocols have been conducted to resolve these issues. One of the important hierarchical protocols that are used to reduce power consumption in WSNs is low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH). This paper presents a comprehensive study of clustering protocols for WSNs that are relevant to LEACH. This paper is the first to emphasis on cluster formation and CHs selection methods and their strengths and weaknesses. A new taxonomy is presented to discuss LEACH variants on the basis of different classes, and the current survey is compared with other existing surveys. A complete comparison of the location, energy, complexity, reliability, multi–hop path, and load balancing characteristics of LEACH variants is conducted. Future research guidelines for CHs selection and cluster formation in WSNs are also discussed. © 2018 by the authors.

WSN has a broad range of important applications such as environmental monitoring, health monitoring, and various industrial and military applications. The various routing protocols in WSN manage the load balance, energy consumption and the expansion of the network. This study outlines the procedure of developing scalable, low energy and highly adaptive clustering hierarchy routing protocol. The main objective is to maintain the network lifespan over the network expansion. We refer to the proposed protocol as Energy-Efficient Scalable Routing Algorithm (EESRA). The EESRA protocol is expected to optimize the well-known LEACH protocol for more energy efficiency on a large scale WSN. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

Multicasting service is a solution to provide better performance with lower resource consumption in such applications. However, sensors and devices are scattered geographically across vast areas and form partitioned networks due to the absence of end-to-end network connection between devices located in the different network. Existing Internet protocols cannot work well in this kind of intermittent network with a long propagation delay. Although Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) enables the communication between the partitioned network, achieving multicast routing in DTN has been identified as the new challenge to be solved. In this paper, we presented an initial concept and implementation of Reliable Multicast Disruption Tolerant Networking (RMDTN) protocol to realize multicast support in DTN using the designated ferry as a data mule for better resource utilization. An Ethernet testbed is setup to test the implementation and evaluation is done with the comparison to two common routing protocols. © 2017 IEEE.","Disruption Tolerant Networking; Internet of Things; Message Ferry; Reliable Multicast; Routing Protocol","Internet of things; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Network routing; Routing protocols; Disruption tolerant networking; Intermittent networks; Message ferries; Multicasting services; Partitioned networks; Reliable Multicast; Resource consumption; Resource utilizations; Delay tolerant networks",,,,,"University of Southern Mississippi, USM

Constructive Interference (CI) enables reliable and fast network flooding, to decrease the scheduling overhead of MAC protocols, improve link quality of lossy links, achieve accurate time synchronization, and to realize efficient data collection. This paper presents a mathematical analysis of a WS N utilizing CI-Flooding, to investigate the network performance represented by the network throughput and lifetime. The mathematical analysis shows that the number of nodes, error displacement and distances between hops have the greatest impact on the network performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Concurrent transmissions; Constructive Interference; Synchronized Flooding; Wireless Sensor Networks","Floods; Medium access control; Network performance; Concurrent transmission; Constructive interference; Data collection; Mathematical analysis; Network throughput; Performance analysis; Time synchronization; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,,,"Sha, M., Xing, G., Zhou, G., Liu, S., Wang, X., C-MAC: Model dr IV en concurrent medium access control for wireless sensor networks (2009) Proc.

One of serious challenges is to design a robust routing protocol that is capable of tackling the frequent link disruptions which are caused by vehicle mobility. Geographic forwarding strategy-based routing protocols are found more suitable in highly dynamic network such VANET. Link expiry time-based (LET) routing is being utilised to minimise link breakages in effectively mobile networks. However, it may cause some issues such as increasing delay and routing loops due to non-optimal selection of next-hop. This paper proposes a relative velocitybased geographic forwarding (RVGF) strategy which aims to enhance the link stability with respect to geographic information. Relative velocity model is introduced where speed and direction of vehicles are utilised to improve forwarding decisions in VANET. RVGF can help in minimising the probability of link breakage and ensuring high packet delivery.

In case of sparse topology, a multi-hop single path routing is usually used to pass information from a source node to a destination node. A problem with this approach is the loss of connectivity of nodes in the path between source and destination, which may lead to network partitioning. Constructive interference (CI) is used to increase the transmission range of the node and connect disconnected parts of a network to overcome the separation problem. CI- based flooding first presented by Glossy can realize millisecond network flooding latency and sub-microsecond time synchronization accuracy, adapt to topology changes and require no network state information. However, Glossy suffers the scalability problem. The packet reception performances of the forwarded nodes degrade significantly as the size or the density of the network increases. In addition, Glossy produces substantial unnecessary data forwarding, which significantly reduces the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop selective CI-based flooding (MSCIF) approach to improve the CI flooding scalability and reduce energy consumption. The proposed protocol works on a cluster-based network and build a virtual backbone from source to destination, consist of the best dominant nodes to perform the flooding. The dominant nodes are selected based on distances between hops and the residual energy in each node. The mathematical analysis shows that the proposed approach reduces the energy consumption and improves the packet reception ratio (PRR). © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

Data mules such as workers or vehicles, which pass through the monitored area periodically, bridge the gap between disconnected networks. Since data dissemination often involves multiple users, and configuration updates from the Monitoring and Control Center needs to be delivered reliably to all participating IoT devices, the combination of efficient Reliable Multicast algorithms with DTN should address this problem effectively.

These challenges should be managed effectively by the routing protocol. Geographic forwarding-based routing protocols are found to be effective in VANET, where geographic location information is utilized to select the next-hop for packet forwarding. Forwarding strategy is known as the core of such protocols to select the suitable forwarder among neighbouring nodes that can enhance the performance of routing strongly. Several research works have been developed to improve the forwarding strategy in VANET. However, some key issues such as utilizing the vehicle density to improve forwarding decision and reduce network congestion were not addressed. In this paper, an innovative forwarding strategy, called Density-aware Directional (DAD), with a joint consideration of vehicle density factor and directional forwarding is proposed for next-hop selection. It is aimed to manage the number of candidate next-hops as function of density and reduce routing loop by involving a directional angle. The proposed forwarding strategy was analyzed numerically to verify that it achieves the target properties. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Ad hoc networks; Routing protocols; Traffic congestion; Dynamic topologies; Forwarding strategies; Geographic forwarding; Geographic location; Neighbouring nodes; Network congestions; Next-hop selection; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks",,,,,,,,"Cheng, H.T., Shan, H., Zhuang, W., Infotainment and road safety service support in vehicular networking: From a communication perspective (2011) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 25, pp. 2020-2038; Enkelmann, W., Fleetnet-applications for inter-vehicle communication (2003) Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2003.

The performance of LTE system for different packet size is done. The simulation experiments are done using Mat lab and Simulink libraries. The results show and discuss the effects of packet size and adaptation modulation on the performance of LTE based on throughput and packet loss. Moreover, the Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold values can be optimized in order to enhance the performance of LTE system.

The consequences of link failures trigger a lot of route discoveries that generates numerous number of route request (RREQ) packets. This can cause high overhead due the big amount of control packets propagated throughout the network where the resources, such as battery and bandwidth, are consumed inefficiently. As a result, the network lifetime and performance are degraded seriously. The route discovery procedure in most of these protocols does not consider the limitation of network resources. Common source routing protocols, such as DSR and RDSR, blindly flood the network with RREQs whenever a route to a destination is needed. Blind flooding causes redundancy, contention and collision in the network which increases the overhead in MANETs. This paper presents a feasible progressives route discovery strategy for source routing to reduce the overhead by reducing the amount of flooding of RREQs in the network. The performance of the proposed strategy was evaluated and compared to DSR and RDSR in terms of the amount of RREQ and control packets generated. The results showed that the proposed strategy improves the performance and extend the lifetime of the network as it presents lower number of RREQs and overhead compared to DSR and RDSR. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Gaussian Q-function is gaining more intention from researchers due to its direct relation in computing the error probability in terms of symbol error rate (SER) or bit error rate. In literature, several approximated functions have been proposed to evaluate and analyze the error rate in fading channel. In this paper, a novel, simple and accurate closed form for Gaussian Q-function is derived. In contrast to previous related approximated functions; it is noticeable that the designed formula improves the accuracy for large range of positive argument. Furthermore, an efficient SER formula is derived for additive white Gaussian noise and for Rayleigh fading channel. Numerical analysis and simulation were conducted to verify and validate the designed approximated functions. The results show that the proposed form can achieve high accuracy compared to that of previous work; and also simplify the evaluation analysis of SER in fading channels. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","AWGN; Bit error rate; Q-function; Rayleigh fading channel","Bit error rate; Errors; Fading channels; Function evaluation; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Analysis and simulation; Approximated functions; AWGN; Error probabilities; Gaussian Q-function; Q-functions; Symbol error rate (SER); Rayleigh fading",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PNAV/814233","The authors would like to thank the Univeristi Sains Malaysia for providing RUI Grant entitled Relative Velocity-based Forwarding Strategy For Vehicular Ad hoc Naetworks (1001/PNAV/814233) to fund this research project.",,"Dhungana, Y., Tellambura, C., New simple approximations for error probability and outage in fading (2012) IEEE Communications Letters, 16, pp. 1760-1763; Alkurd, R., Abualhaol, I., & Muhaidat, S.

The model investigates user traffic, including that injected through distributed gateways and that destined to gateways that are experiencing actual attacks. Misbehaving traffic filtration is triggered only when the network is congested, at which point burst gateways generate an explicit congestion notification (ECN) to misbehaving users. To investigate the behavior of misbehaving user traffic, packet delay variation (PDV) ratios are actively estimated and packet transfer rates are passively measured at a unit time. Users who exceed the PDV bit rates specified in their service level agreements (SLAs) are filtered as suspicious users. In addition, suspicious users who exceed the SLA bandwidth bit rates are filtered as network intruders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently filters network traffic and precisely detects malicious traffic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This research evaluates RObust Header Compression (ROHC) for Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) in terms of network performance and practical implementation design of a ROHC via Satellite test-bed. Moreover, mathematical model was presented to estimate the theoretical performance characteristics of ROHC compressed traffic which is then compared with empirical results. The experiments showed that ROHC delivered significant improvement in bandwidth utilization for packets with small payload sizes with up to 86% gain in throughput performance when compressing traffic. Packets with larger payload sizes exhibited an exponential decrease of throughput gain achievable through ROHC as the size of the payload increased.

The random and unpredictable node mobility in MANETs has negative impact on the network performance as it makes the network prone to frequent link breakages which increase packet loss and control overhead. Reliable MANET can be achieved through fast link failures detection that enables fast notification to be delivered to sources in order to make proper reaction. Therefore, the research work in this paper presents an effective topology-aware method, called Route Failure Prediction (RFP), which predicts the link breakage before it actually occurs in source routing networks. A node that utilizes RFP divides the area within transmission range into regions based on the signal strength received from neighbors. It calculates the changing rate of its location and update the upstream node if it is about to move out of the transmission range to avoid communication disruption. The performance of RFP was evaluated using ns-2 and compared to that of DSR. The experimental results gained from simulations were analyzed in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Control Overhead (COH), and the End-to-End Delay with respect to the number of events of link breakage happened during the experiments. The numerical results showed that RFP outperforms DSR significantly and offers reliable data transfer between sources and destinations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","DSR; Link failure detection; MANET; Routing protocols","Artificial intelligence; Coal breakage; Data transfer; Learning systems; Network routing; Routing protocols; Signal detection; Signal processing; Telecommunication networks; Topology; Link failure detection; MANET; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Numerical results; Packet delivery ratio; Reliable data transfers; Sources and destinations; Transmission ranges; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,"NAv6

A large number of proposed protocols in the literature employ a message passing mechanism to make sensor node clocks tick in unison. In this paper, we first classify Message Passing based Time Synchronization (MPTS) protocols and then analyze them based on different metrics. The classification is based on the following three criteria: structure formation of the network affected by the synchronization protocol, frequency of synchronization process (synchronization interval), and synchronization message overhead. Proposed protocols are analyzed and evaluated from different perspectives based on available data. A comparison table of the reviewed protocols is presented according to the evaluation metrics. Finally, some potential methods will be proposed to improve the synchronization process. © 2016 Mohammad Ali Sarvghadi and Tat-Chee Wan.",,"Internet protocols; Sensor nodes; Synchronization; Evaluation metrics;

This paper provides a study of the transmission, modeling, and analysis of variable bit rate (VBR) video, which is fundamental for designing protocols and for effective utilization of networks in video transmission. To meet the specified requirements of future networks, the scalable video codec (SVC) was chosen as the video compression standard. The main objective of this work was to propose a statistical model that will allow better coordination between generated SVC video traffic and original video traffic. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the model with three existing low-complex statistical models using graphical and statistical measurements as well as cross-validation. For all evaluation techniques, the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated, and the frame size distribution of the modeled traffic was found to match that of the original video traffic better than other existing models.

In the many-to-one WSNs, the nodes located around the sink relay the data from other sensor nodes, which depletes their energy more quickly, resulting in energy holes and hot spot areas. When an energy hole appears, data cannot be sent from other sensors to the sink even though most of the sensors still have energy. In this paper, we generally classified the schemes proposed for solving the energy hole problem. In addition, we investigated the basic mathematical modeling of network connectivity and coverage, energy consideration, and optimum width of coronas in the corona-based WSNs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy hole; Heterogeneous; Homogeneous; Lifetime; Sensor network","Cellular radio systems; Computer applications; Electrical engineering; Sensor networks; Energy considerations; Energy holes; Heterogeneous; Homogeneous; Lifetime; Mitigation techniques; Network connectivity; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",,,,,"304/PNAV/6312093","This research was sponsored by National Advanced IPv6 Centre, Universiti Sains Malaysia through Grant No. 304/PNAV/6312093.",,"Perillo, M., Cheng, Z., Heinzelman, W., An analysis of strategies for mitigating the sensor network hot spot problem.

Reliable information transmission requires the full connectivity of the network because of the multi-hop communication of wireless sensor networks. A network is fully connected if each pair of nodes can communicate with each other, either directly or through intermediate relay nodes. The current study presents a Harmony Search (HS) algorithm to improve the connectivity of the non-uniform density wireless sensor networks. HS is a meta-heuristic algorithm, which mimics the actions of harmonizing musical instruments, including memory-based, random, and pitch-adjusted play, during improvisation. In the present work, HS is used to optimize the phase shift parameters of sensors node inside the cluster to ensure maximum radiation field at the reception point. This process results in a significant increase in the coverage area of cluster nodes, consequently increasing network connectivity.","Connectivity; Harmony search algorithm; Non-uniform density; Wireless sensor networks","Algorithms;

Vehicular networks expected to support variety types of application including safety and non- safety applications, which need certain level of quality satisfactory. Therefore, forwarding strategy should be able to handle the challenges of such environment such frequent link disruptions. Greedy forwarding (GF) consider only the position of neighboring nodes to forward the data, and Directional Greedy Routing (DGR) protocol add the direction of neighboring nodes to its decision. Relative velocity concept can play a main role to ensure the link stability and increase the probability of successful transmission. In this work, relative velocity is employed to design new geographic forwarding strategy called Relative Velocity-based Directional Greedy Forwarding (RVDF) strategy. The proposed RVDF is aimed to ensure the packet is forwarded to the optimal next-hop node (vehicle). The proposed scheme can help to minimize the probability of link breakage and ensure packet delivery with minimum delay. © 2014 International Information Institute.","Forwarding strategy; Position-based Routing; VANET",,,,,,,,,"Hanshi, S.M., Kadhum, M.M., Geographic routing protocol issues in vehicular ad hoc networks (2013) RFID-Technologies and Applications (RFID-TA), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-7; Cheng, H.T., Shan, H., Zhuang, W., Infotainment and road safety service support in vehicular networking: From a communication perspective Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 25 (2011), pp. 2020-2038; Lee, Y.H., Vehicle routing problem with pickups under dynamic rescheduling environment (2012) Information- An International Interdisciplinary Journal, 15 (12). , December; Enkelmann, W., Fleetnet-applications for inter-vehicle communication (2003) Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2003.

At the end a comparison is done for the reviewed protocols. © 2014 IEEE.","drift; offset; skew; synchronization message delay; timestamp","Sensor nodes; Synchronization; drift; Message delay; offset; skew; Time-stamp; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,,,"Ali, M., Saif, U., Dunkels, A., Voigt, T., Römer, K., Langendoen, K., Polastre, J., Uzmi, Z.A., Medium access control issues in sensor networks (2006) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 36 (2), pp. 33-36; Ganeriwal, S., Kumar, R., Srivastava, M.B., Timing-sync protocol for sensor networks (2003) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, pp. 138-149. , ACM; Maróti, M., Kusy, B., Simon, G., Lédeczi, A., The flooding time synchronization protocol (2004) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, pp. 39-49. , ACM; Elson, J., Girod, L., Estrin, D., Fine-grained network time synchronization using reference broadcasts (2002) ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review, 36 (SI), pp. 147-163; Vig, J.R., Introduction to quartz frequency standards (1992) DTIC Document, , Tech.

Although the performance can be improved by applying an effective network-based IP mobility scheme in place of the traditional host-based alternatives, the existing inter-domain extensions of network-based IP mobility continue to suffer from an extended handover latency. This paper proposes a new interdomain network-based IP mobility scheme based on node movement prediction. The proposed scheme accelerates the handover by preparing the future domain of the mobile node in a proactive manner. Analytical and simulation-based evaluations confirm improved performance of the proposed scheme in terms of handover latency and packet loss compared with existing schemes. © 2014 KICS.","Inter-domain handover; Internet protocol (IP) handover; Movement prediction; Network-based IP mobility","Internet; Handover; Handover latency; Handover performance; Inter-domain handover; IP mobility; IP mobility scheme; Mobility protocols; Movement prediction; Internet protocols",,,,,,,,"Johnson, D., Perkins, C., Arkko, J., Mobility support in IPv6 (2004) IETF RFC 3775, , June; Fathi, H., Chakraborty, S.S., Prasad, R., Optimization of mobile IPv6-based handovers to support VoIP services in wireless heterogeneous networks (2007) IEEE Trans.

However, this concept has limited application in LTE networks. As such, alpha-Shannon capacity, which is modified from Shannon capacity, has been proposed for use in LTE networks. Nonetheless, the existing alpha-Shannon capacity formula is still unable to predict accurately the standard peak data rate capacities for LTE. This study proposes a modified alpha-Shannon capacity formula to better predict the value of the LTE peak data rate. In the proposed modification, the system level bandwidth efficiency α value and required maximum target SNR efficiency ω value for each modulation type are taken into consideration for calculating the expected peak data rate. The proposed formula is compared against the alpha-Shannon capacity formula. Results show that the proposed formula is more accurate for the standard LTE than the alpha-Shannon capacity. Consequently, the proposed formula can improve the estimation accuracy of link adaptation techniques to achieve better network performance.

However, with the increase in real-time traffic requirements in wireless sensor nodes, network performance metrics are increasingly important. Nonetheless, most existing network performance studies were done via simulation, with few experimental studies performed on testbeds using ad hoc methodologies. This paper proposes a structured experimental methodology for evaluating the delay, throughput, and packet loss performance of wireless sensor networks, while addressing practical issues related to the use of an experimental approach. A global clock synchronization technique, in addition to insertion of timestamps in the network packets was proposed for more accurate measurement of the network delay. Several different physical topologies such as single cluster, chain, and cluster tree topologies were defined as standard test topologies. The EMLMAC protocol was used to demonstrate the viability of the proposed structured experimental methodology. Based on the proposed experimental approach, the measured throughput for EMLMAC for the single cluster two-hop and three-hop chain topologies differed by 1.02%, 6.75% and 13.91% respectively from the simulation results. This indicates that an experimental approach is essential for verifying the actual performance of a wireless sensor network. © 2013 IEEE.","delay; experimental methodology; packet loss; throughput; time synchronization; wireless sensor network","delay; Experimental approaches; Experimental methodology; Global clock synchronizations; Medium access control protocols; Network performance metrics; Packet loss performance; Time synchronization; Advanced traffic management systems; Chains; Energy utilization; Medium access control; Network performance; Packet loss; Throughput; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor nodes",,,,,,,,"Grilo, A., Macedo, M., Nunes, M., An energy-efficient low-latency multi-sink mac protocol for alarm-driven wireless sensor networks (2007) Proc. 3rd Int.

Although hybrid satellite-wireless system seems to be an ideal network, transporting IP-based packet via satellite can be a challenge. High header overheads consume a significant portion of bandwidth and lower the transmission efficiency. This paper presents a comparative study of hybrid header compression schemes that enable the saving of resources over the hybrid network. The hybrid header compression schemes are proposed over loosely coupled and tightly coupled hybrid satellite-wireless networks. The effectiveness of deploying hybrid header compression schemes in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is evaluated. The findings from this study contribute to a better understanding on how to enhance the bandwidth utilization in both loosely coupled and tightly coupled hybrid satellite-wireless networks that can be useful for deployment of broadband connectivity in rural areas. © 2013 by the IETE.","Header compression;

The model investigates these users by measuring their bandwidth consumption ratios. User traffic that exceeds the service-level agreement bandwidth ratio is filtered as intrusive.

For example, video streaming in a disaster-management scenario requires careful handling to ensure that the end-to-end delay is within the acceptable range and the video is received properly without any distortion. The failure to transmit a video stream effectively occurs for many reasons, including sensor function limitations, excessive power consumption, and a lack of routing reliability. We propose a novel mathematical model for quality of service (QoS) route determination that enables a sensor to determine the optimal path for minimising resource use while satisfying the required QoS constraints. The proposed mathematical model uses the Lagrangian relaxation mixed integer programming technique to define critical parameters and appropriate objective functions for controlling the adaptive QoS constrained route discovery process. Performance trade-offs between QoS requirements and energy efficiency were simulated using the LINGO mathematical programming language. The proposed approach significantly improves the network lifetime, while reducing energy consumption and decreasing average end-to-end delays within the sensor network via optimised resource sharing in intermediate nodes compared with existing routing algorithms. © 2013 Mohammed Zaki Hasan and Tat-Chee Wan.",,,,,,,,,,"Akyildiz, I.F., Melodia, T., Chowdhury, K.R., A survey on wireless multimedia sensor networks (2007) Computer Networks, 51 (4), pp. 921-960. , DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2006.10.002, PII S1389128606002751;

NEMO Basic Support Protocol (NEMO) has been standardized by this group to provide the network mobility support. However, the handover latency in NEMO is high and, the nested tunnels' problem in the nested NEMO networks is not considered. Many schemes have been proposed to solve these problems by optimizing the handover signaling procedure, and by proposing routing optimization scheme for NEMO. Better optimized signaling procedure is proposed in this paper, and a proposed Routing Optimization scheme as a solution for the lack of the nested tunnels' problem is proposed as well. Analytical results highlight the importance of the proposed scheme comparing to others are provided, revealing that the proposed scheme has the lowest handover latency and disruption time.

Existing phishing e-mail prevention mechanisms do not perform well against zero-day phishing e-mail attacks. This paper introduces a novel framework, called phishing dynamic evolving neural fuzzy framework (PDENFF), which adapts the ""evolving connectionist system"" based on a hybrid (supervised/unsupervised) learning approach. PDENFF adaptive online is enhanced by offline learning to detect dynamically the unknown zero-day phishing e-mails. Our analyses have shown that this framework is designed for high-speed ""life-long"" learning with low memory footprint and minimizes the complexity of the rule base and configuration. This framework achieves high performance, including high level of accuracy, true positive, and true negative results that reached up to 99%, 97%, and 98%, respectively, and an improvement between 3% and 13% comparison of the generated existing solutions to zero-day phishing e-mail exploits. © 2013 ICIC International.","Dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system (DENFIS);

Criminals try to lure online users by convincing them to reveal the username, passwords, credit card number and updating account information or fill billing information. One of the main problems of phishing email detection is the unknown ""zero-day""phishing attack, (we define zero-day attacks as attacks that phisher mount using hosts that do not appear in blacklists and not trained on the old data sample and it is a noise data), which increases the level of difficulty to detect phishing email. Nowadays, phishers are creating different representation ""zero-day"" phishing email to breach the defenses of those detectors. Our proposed is a novel framework called phishing dynamic evolving neural fuzzy framework (PDENF), which adapts the evolving connectionist system (ECoS) based on a hybrid (supervised/unsupervised) learning approach. PDENF adaptive online is enhanced by offline learning to detect dynamically the phishing email included unknown zero-day phishing e-mails before it get to user account.PDENF is suggested to work for high-speed ""life-long"" learning with low memory footprint and minimizes the complexity of he rule base and configuration with few number of rules creation for email classification. We expect to achieves high performance, including high level of true positive, true negative, sensitivity, precision, F-measure and overall accuracy compared with other approaches.","Detection; Evolving connectionist System (Ecos); Phishing email; Zero-day",,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimeh, S., Nappa, D., A comparison of machine learning techniques for phishing detection (2007) Proceedings of the eCrime Researchers Summit, , Pittsburgh, PA,, ACM; Almomani, A., Wan, T.-C., An Online Model on Evolving Phishing E-mail Detection and Classification Method (2011) journal of applied science, 11 (18), pp. 3301-3307; Almomani, A., Wan, T.-C., ""An enhanced online phishing e-mail detection framework based on ""evolving connectionist system"" (2012) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control (IJICIC), 9 (2); Almomani, A., Wan, T.-C., Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network for Phishing Emails Detection (2012) Journal of Computer Science, 8 (7), pp. 1099-1107; Almomani, A., Wan, T.-C., Asurvay of learning-based techniques of phishing email filtering (2012) International Journal of Digital Content Technology and its Applications(JDCTA), 6 (18); APWG (2010) Phishing Activity Trends Report, , http://www.antiphishing.org/reports/apwg_report_Q1_2010.pdf, from; Bergholz, A., De Beer, J., New filtering approaches for phishing email (2010) Journal of computer security, 18 (1), pp. 7-35; Bimal Parmar, F., Protecting against spear-phishing (2012) Computer Fraud & Security, (1), pp. 8-11. , 2012; Cook, D.L., Gurbani, V.K., Phishwish: a simple and stateless phishing filter (2009) Security and Communication Networks, 2 (1), pp. 29-43; Dunlop, M., Groat, S., (2010) GoldPhish: Using Images for Content-Based Phishing Analysis, IEEE; Fette, I., Sadeh, N., Learning to detect phishing emails (2007) Proceedings of the 16th International World Wide Web Conference(WWW 2007), , Banff, Alberta, Canada, ACM Press; GARTNER (2007) Gartner Survey Shows Phishing Attacks Escalated in 2007; More than 3 Billion Lost to These Attacks, , http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=565125, Retrieved December 17, from; Song, Y.C.Q., Dynamic neural fuzzy inference system (2009) Advances in Neuro-Information Processing 5506/2009, pp. 1245-1250; IID (2011) eCrime Trends Report, 1; Islam, M.R., Abawajy, J., Multi-tier phishing email classification with an impact of classifier rescheduling (2009) The International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, , Algorithms, and Networks, Kaohsiung, Taiwan IEEE; Kasabov, L.B.A.N., EVOLVING CONNECTIONIST SYSTEM(ECOS) (2007) Computational Neurogenetic Modeling SPRINGER; Kasabov, N., Song, Q., DENFIS: dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system and its application for time-series prediction (2002) Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on, 10 (2), pp. 144-154; Khonji, M., Iraqi, Y., Enhancing Phishing E-Mail Classifiers:A Lexical URL Analysis Approach (2012) International Journal for Information Security Research (IJISR), 2 (1-2); Khonji, M., Jones, A., A novel Phishing classification based on URL features (2011) GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC), 2011 IEEE; MAAWG (2011) Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG)Email Metrics Program. 15. third Quarter.; Kasabov, N., Song, Z.S.H.C., Greer, D., (2005) Evolving Connectionist Systems with Evolutionary Self-Optimisation springer, 173; Saberi, A., Vahidi, M., Learn to Detect Phishing Scams Using Learning and Ensemble?

The goal of this study is to develop a protocol which improves the delivery ratio of warning messages with low end-to-end delay in high density networks while using the network bandwidth efficiently. In order to deal with data dissemination under various network densities, a modified dissemination protocol prevents the broadcast storm and synchronization problems. The simulation results show that the E1PD protocol achieved a higher delivery ratio compared to S1PD in low vehicle traffic density. Furthermore, E1PD presented lower end-to-end delay in diverse density network conditions, while efficiently using the bandwidth of the wireless network compared to O1PD protocol. © 2012 IEEE.","Data disseination protocol; ITS; V-2-I; V-2-V; VANETs","Data dissemination protocols; Dissemination protocols; ITS; Synchronization problem; V-2-I; V-2-V; VANETs; Vehicle ad-hoc networks; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",,,,,,,,"Emmelmann, M., (2010) Vehicular Networking: Automotive Applications and beyond, 2. , Wiley; Sengupta, K., A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study of the efficacy and safety of 5-loxin for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (2008) Arthritis Research & Therapy, 10, p. 85; Guo, J., Balon, N., (2006) Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and Dedicated Short-Range Communication, , University of Michigan - Dearbon June 26; Korkmaz, G., Black-burst-based multihop broadcast protocols for vehicular networks (2007) Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 56, pp. 3159-3167; Liu, C., Chigan, C., Rpb-md: Providing robust message dissemination for vehicular ad hoc networks (2011) Ad Hoc Networks, 10, pp. 497-511; Wisitpongphan, N., Broadcast storm mitigation techniques in vehicular ad hoc networks (2007) Wireless Communications, 14, pp. 84-94; Schwartz, R.S., A directional data dissemination protocol for vehicular environments (2011) Computer Communications, 34, pp. 2057-2071; Blum, J.J., Eskandarian, A., Avoiding timeslot boundary synchronization for multihop message broadcast in vehicular networks (2009) Vehicular Technology Conference, Middletown, PA, pp. 1-5","Rostami, F.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia; email: fa.rostami0@gmail.com",,,,"2012 International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies, ISTT 2012","26 November 2012 through 28 November 2012","Kuala Lumpur",96337,,9781467347860,,,"English","Int.

This method is an efficient approach for network modelling of sensor data transmission. In this framework, clusters of neighbouring nodes are formed. Collectively, these clusters can significantly improve the transmission of information. The method is based on network clustering and the coherent addition of transmission fields from closely spaced wireless nodes. MHCTI can improve the data transmission distance range and be used to address the problem of low network connectivity in cases of non-uniform wireless node density, consequently increasing the lifetime of the sensor network. To analyse the effectiveness of the proposed method, the network lifetime and connectivity of the MHCTI method were compared with those of previous approaches. Moreover, a simple adaptive algorithm was investigated. In this algorithm, phase shifts in the radiator are randomly selected, and the zone covering the sending cluster is controlled, resulting in improved network connectivity. © 2012 ICIC International.","Clustering; Collective information transmission; Connectivity; Lifetime; Non-uniform density; Routing","Clustering; Connectivity; Information transmission; Lifetime; Non-uniform Density; Routing; Adaptive algorithms; Data communication systems; Sensor nodes",,,,,,,,"Culler, D., Estrin, D., Srivastava, M., Overview of sensor networks (2004) IEEE Computer Society, 37, pp. 41-49; Zhao, F., Guibas, L.J., (2004) Wireless Sensor Networks: An Information Processing Approach, , Morgan Kaufmann Pub; Akyildiz, I.F., Su, W., Sankarasubramaniam, Y., Cayirci, E., A survey on sensor networks, Communications Magazine (2002) IEEE, 40, pp. 102-114; Yick, J., Mukherjee, B., Ghosal, D., Wireless sensor network survey (2008) Computer Networks, 52, pp. 2292-2330; Sohraby, K., Minoli, D., Znati, T.F., (2007) Wireless Sensor Networks: Technology, Protocols, and Applications, , Wiley-Blackwell; Mainwaring, A., Culler, D., Polastre, J., Szewczyk, R., Anderson, J., Wireless sensor networks for habitat monitoring (2002) ACM, pp. 88-97; Tubaishat, M., Madria, S., Sensor networks: An overview (2003) Potentials, IEEE, 22, pp. 20-23; Schwiebert, L., Gupta, S.K.S., Weinmann, J., Research challenges in wireless networks of biomedical sensors (2001) ACM, pp. 151-165; Krohn, A., Beigl, M., Decker, C., Riedel, T., Zimmer, T., Varona, D.G., Increasing connectivity in wireless sensor network using cooperative transmission (2006) Proc. of the 3rd International Conference On Networked Sensing Systems, , Chicago, IL, USA; Scaglione, A., Hong, Y.-W., Opportunistic large arrays: Cooperative transmission in wireless multihop ad hoc networks to reach far distances (2003) IEEE Trans.

However, the poor performance of traditional mobile IP protocols can affect negatively delay sensitive services. Recently, network-based IP mobility has been proposed as a potential solution. Although initial evaluations have already confirmed the practical advantages of this new approach, a proper investigation of existing methods has yet to be performed. In the present paper, an evaluation framework is proposed to investigate handover performance metrics in network-based IP mobility. The framework is subsequently employed to analyze prominent methods. Analytical results highlight the efficiency of each solution under different operating conditions and reveal the main factors that affect the performance. Unlike other comparative studies, this framework has been developed to assist IP mobility designers in analyzing the effects of system parameters on their proposed solutions. A new prediction-based mobility solution for metropolitan area networks is suggested, and its design parameters are analyzed by utilizing the proposed framework. The present study not only provides deeper insights into network-based IP mobility but also a framework for faster analysis of future solutions in this category.

Wireless ad hoc networks are well suited for use by emergency response teams, for search and rescue operations that require teambased communications in the absence of working telecommunications infrastructure, while infrastructure networks require the existence of access point in which all the communications are done through it. Unfortunately, wireless ad hoc networks suffer from limited bandwidth and QoS constraints. A Priority eXplicit multiCAST based routing protocol (P-XCAST) is presented in this paper to support team-based many-to-many communications in wireless ad hoc networks. eXplicit multiCAST (XCAST) is well suited for supporting a large number of small groups effectively, in comparison with multicast based protocols. However, since XCAST was initially designed for wired networks, it was not optimized for wireless ad hoc network use. The proposed P-XCAST protocol enhances XCAST for wireless ad hoc network use by modifying the Route Request mechanism in AODV to build the network topology, and route data packets containing the list of destinations for a given group in the XCAST header, by classifying the destinations according to similarities in their next hop neighbors and hop counts. A single data packet is XCASTed in lieu of sending n Unicast data packets to n destinations with the same next hop neighbor. In addition, P-XCAST is merged with a new mobile group management protocol to handle mobility of group members. In this paper, P-XCAST was tested using topologies with different sources that were sending and receiving data at the same time to handle foreground and background many-to-many applications. The results of simulation experiments show that P-XCAST achieved better QoS performance compared with other routing protocols for small group sizes typical of group communications applications such as Push-To-Talk (PTT).","MANETs; P-XCAST; PTT; QoS",,,,,,,,,"Anand, K., (2004) A Scalable Explicit Multicast Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, , MSc Thesis, Btech Electrical Engineering University of Roorkee, India; Andrew, B., (2002) TCP/IP Jump Start-Internet Protocol Basics, , 2ed SYBEX; Aron, I., Gupta, S., A witness-aided routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks with unidirectional links (1999) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Mobile Data Access, pp. 24-33. , UK; Boivie, R., Feldman, N., Iami, Y., Livens, W., Ooms, D., Pariddaens, O., Explicit multicast (XCAST) basic specifications (2005), IETF Internet Draft, December; Charles, P., Elizabeth, B., Samir, D., Ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing (2002), IETF Internet Draft, draft-ietf-manet-AODV- 10.txt, Work in Progress, March; Chen, L., (2006) Protocols for Supporting Quality of Service In Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, PhD Thesis, , University of Rochester, New York; Clausen, T., Jacquet, P., Optimized link state routing protocol (2003), RFC-3626, October; (2008), http://pcl.cs.ucla.edu/projects/glomosm, Glomosim, Last Visited; Ilyas, M., (2003) Ad Hoc Wireless Networks, , CRC Press LLC; Johnson, D., Hu, Y., Maltz, D., The dynamic source routing protocol (DSR) for mobile ad hoc networks for IPv4 (2007), pp. 2-100. , RFC-4728, draft-ietfmanet- dsr-10.text, February; Lavi, N., Cidon, I., Keidar, I., MaGMA: Mobility and group management architecture for real-time collaborative application (2004) Proceedings of the 6th IEEE IFIP Conference On Mobile and Wireless Communication Networks (MWCN), pp. 1-36. , Paris; Lu, H., Denko, M., (2006) Ad-hoc networking: An AODV-based clustering and routing scheme for mobile ad hoc networks, , Springer Boston; Lee, S., Gerla, M., Chiang, C., On-demand multicast routing protocol (1999) Proceedings of IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, pp. 1298-1302. , USA; Novatnack, J., Greenwald, L., Arora, H., Evaluating Ad hoc routing protocols with respect to quality of service (2005) IEEE Communications Magazine, 3 (22-24), pp. 205-212; Saghir, M., (2008) Quality of Service Enabled Cross-Layer Multicast Framework for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, , PhD Thesis, Universiti Sains Malaysia; Tebbe, H., Kassler, A., QAMNet: Providing quality of service to ad hoc multicast enabled networks (2006) Proceedings of 1st International Symposium on Wireless Pervasive Computing (ISWPC), pp. 1-5. , Thailand; Werapum, W., Thavornvisit, K., Performance comparison of TCP and CBR in MAODV Ad hoc network (2007) Proceedings of 2nd International Conference On Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC), p. 4. , France; Zhang, Y., Aaron, G., Quality of service for ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (2005) Proceedings of IEEE Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications, pp. 192-196","Alzyoud, F.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia",,,,,,,,16833198,,,,"English","Int.

Multimedia streaming applications demand high quality of service (QoS), especially from wireless networks, because of the problems that exist in these types of environments, including interference, packet loss, delay, reduction of wireless link utilization, and so on. QoS necessitates the utilization of available resources at different layers of the multimedia system components, such as network, terminal, and content. Thus, a new design called cross-layer has been developed and is now considered beneficial by the research community. The aim of the current paper is to present different cross-layer designs or approaches that are classified into many categories. A cross-layer design based on the direction of information (i.e., downward, upward, hybrid, MAC-centric, and joint adaptation) and on the information itself (i.e., channel state information, QoS-related parameters, resources information, and application-based data) are also presented. In addition, a number of the video-streaming applications and their issues that cross-layer approaches attempt to solve, such as Pre-stored video streaming, real-time streaming, and congestion loss on high-definition three-dimensional television, are presented. As a result, a comparative study among the different approaches in cross-layer design is presented based on cost, QoS parameters (i.e., packet loss, delay, throughput), and complexity factors. This comparison can help in the selection of an appropriate design for the problems desired to be solved. © 2012 by the IETE.","Cross-layer design; Cross-layer optimization; Packet loss; QoS; Video transmission over wireless","Comparative studies; Congestion loss; Cross layer optimization; Cross-layer; Cross-layer approach; Cross-layer design; High definition; High quality; Multimedia streaming; Multimedia streaming applications; New design; QoS parameters; Real time streaming; Research communities; Resources information; Three-dimensional television; Video transmissions; Wireless link; Image communication systems; Multimedia systems; Packet loss; Quality of service; Television applications; Video streaming; Wireless networks; Design",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors are thankful to Institute of Postgraduate Studies and Universiti Sains Malaysia for the fellowship awarded to Ali Bin Salem to support his research.",,"Azri, Z., Suzuki, T., Tasaka, S., Application-level qos and qoe assessment of a cross-layer packet scheduling scheme for audio-video transmission over error-prone ieee 802.11e hcca wireless lans (2010) Journal of IEICE Transaction Communication, E93-B (6), pp. 1384-1394. , June; Goudarzi, P., Moin, M.S., (2008) Multi-source Video Transmission with Optimum Perceptual Quality over Wireless Ad Hoc Networks, 5174, pp. 61-71. , Springer Berlin /Heidelberg Aug; Toufik, A., Ismail, D., Delivering audiovisual content with mpeg-21-enabled cross-layer qos adaptation (2006) Journal of Zhejiang University Science A, 7 (5), pp. 784-793; Dobson, S., Putting meaning into the network: Some semantic issues for the design of autonomic communications systems (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3457, pp. 207-216. , Autonomic Communication - First International IFIP Workshop, WAC 2004; Haas, Z.J., Guest editorial: Design methodologies for adaptive and multimedia networks (2001) IEEE Communications Magazine, 39 (11), pp. 106-107. , DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2001.965366; Razzaque, M.A., Dobson, S., Nixon, P., Cross-layer architectures for autonomic communications (2007) Journal of Network and Systems Management, 15 (1), pp. 13-27. , DOI 10.1007/s10922-006-9051-8; Vijay, T., Iyer, S., Cross layer design optimizations in wireless protocol stacks (2004) Computer Communications (Elsevier) Journal, 27 (8), pp. 720-724; Wu, G., Bai, Y., Lai, J., Ogielski, A., Interactions between tcp and rlp in wireless internet (1999) Global Telecommunications Conference 1999 (GLOBECOM '99), pp. 661-666. , Rio de Janeireo; Forouzan, B.A., Fegan, S.C., (2007) Data Communication and Networking, , 4th ed, New York, NY, USA: McGrawHill;; Wang, C., Lin, T., Lin, P., Cross-layer analysis and design for multimedia services in ieee 802.11 wlans (2008) Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications, and Systems, pp. 1-6. , Taiwan, Sept; Schaar Der M.Van, Shankar, S., Cross-layer wireless multimedia transmission: Challenges, principles and new paradigms (2004) IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine, 12 (4), pp. 50-58. , Nov; Srivastava, V., Cross-layer design: A survey and the road ahead (2005) IEEE Communications Magazine, 43 (12), pp. 112-119. , Dec; Gineste, M., Van Wambeke, N., Exposito, E., Chassot, C., Dairaine, L., A cross-layer approach to enhance qos for multimedia applications over satellite (2009) Wireless Pers Commun, 50 (3), pp. 305-328. , Aug; Pradas, D., Bouabdallah, A., Lacan, J., Vazquez Castro, M.A., Bousquet, M., Cross-layer optimization of unequal protected layered video over hierarchical modulation (2009) Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2009.

Authentication and encryption are the most important security techniques used by CDMA mobile network. While encryption technique is used to provide confidentiality to the transmitted data and voice over the network, the authentication technique is used to allow only authorized users to access the network. The authentication of CDMA2000 mobile network includes two processes: provisioning the subscriber authentication key and mutual authentication between user and service network. In this study a comparison among some modern public key cryptosystem (RSA, ECC, ECDH, DH, MQV and ECMQV) is implemented, the results show that the superiority of ECC and ECDH public key technique over other public key techniques based on the key length and the implementation speed. For these reason the proposed CDMA2000 authentication technique uses ECDH public key to provide the subscriber authentication key, also ECC is proposed to be used to provide authentication request and mutual authentication between user and service network. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.","Authentication; CDMA; CDMA2000; Cryptography; Mobile network; Public key; Security",,,,,,,,,"(2009) Security architecture, , 3GPP. 3GPP TS 33.102, Version 9.1.0; Enhanced cryptographic algorithms, , 3GPP2 3GPP2 S.S0055-A, Version 4.0.

VoIP technology employs Internet infrastructure and protocols to transfer VoIP data between call parties. Unfortunately, none of the existing Internet transport layer protocols address VoIP application requirements. Typically, the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) application layer protocol and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport layer protocol are bound together to address VoIP application requirements. However, a combination of RTP and UDP reduces the quality of VoIP applications and causes inefficient bandwidth utilization. In the present work, a dedicated transport protocol named Internet Telephony Transport Protocol (ITTP) was designed to carry VoIP application data. ITTP is designed to address key VoIP requirements and handle the problems resulting from RTP/UDP. A simple mathematical model was used to evaluate ITTP bandwidth efficiency and compare it with RTP/UDP. ITTP was found to improve bandwidth usage substantially. In addition, ITTP was simulated using Network Simulation 2. The results showed that ITTP had better performance compared with RTP/UDP in terms of packet loss, delay and bandwidth usage. © 2012 ISSN 1349-4198.","ITTP; RTP; Signaling protocols; VoIP; VoIP quality","Application layer protocols;

Multicast has the potential to optimize network performance and support scalable distributed applications without compromising performance, efficiency, and QoS but introduces new challenges to transmit multicast packet in the backbone especially when incorporated into wireless mesh network with limited bandwidth. We propose ROHC enabled tunnel for source specific multicast architecture that will compress packet header and aggregate them to together in a frame to save bandwidth and address the packet loss. Our ROHC enabled tunneling protocol will act as SSM channel (S, G) and is designed to be deployed in the backbone network. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the how to address the bandwidth efficiency and packet loss with respect to our proposed tunneling protocol. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","IPv6; ROHC; Source-specific multicast; Tunneling protocol; VOIP","IPv6; ROHC; Source specific multicast; Tunneling protocol; VOIP; Bandwidth; Engineering technology; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Materials science; MESH networking; Multicasting; Network performance; Packet loss; Video streaming; Voice/data communication systems; Network architecture",,,,,,,,"Piri, E., Pinola, J., Fitzek, F., Pentikousis, K., ROHC and aggregated VoIP over fixed WiMAX: An empirical evaluation (2008) Proc.

Providing an in-depth understanding, analysis, and classifications of WiMAX scheduling schemes is of utmost importance toward designing effective practical schedulers. This article provides a comprehensive survey of various WiMAX scheduling schemes for both point-to-multipoint and multi-hop relay systems. We first discuss on an existing QoS architecture of conventional WiMAX systems, then we make a comprehensive classification and in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the-art of single- and multi-hop relay systems which further classifies the scheduling schemes based on the use of channel state condition, queue state, and type of scheduling scheme. We also highlight detailed descriptions of various design aspects, objectives, methodologies, and limitations of the previously proposed researches. After extensively reviewing literatures on scheduling mechanisms, we found out that there still remain many issues and consideration in the previously scheduler designs. Hence, we discussed on the main important aspects related to schedulers design to assist researchers, network designers, and Internet Service Providers in designing effective practical schedulers for single-hop or multi-hop relay systems.

Starting with an assumption that a circum-terra ring can be deployed in LEO, a high-bandwidth, optical-fiber-based, communication system has been proposed as the first of a system of LEO and higher-orbit (MEO) rings for different purposes. These rings about the Earth would complement existing terrestrial and space communications networks and thereby improve global connectivity and throughput. In particular, networking issues necessary for both initial and expanded-ring system communications are addressed. A proposed component of a system of circum-Terra rings, the LEO ARCHIPELAGO, would consist of about 200 sub satellites in a single orbital plane interconnected using a 40,000 km fiber-optic ring. Traditionally, both Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) and Inter-Ring Links (IRL) links have relied on RF communication links. However, with the prospect of the LEO ARCHIPELAGO™ using high tensile-strength fiber cables for ring stabilization, the use of fiber-optic-based ISL becomes a possibility. A low-loss hybrid architecture for a Reconfigurable Optical Add Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) would be the major part of each LEO satellite node that provides for bi-directional links over a ring fiber. This architecture for ROADM subsystem is one of its kind. It performs better than the latest available ROADM models and would reduce the overall network operating cost. The hybrid ROADM architecture combines the best features of Planar Light-wave Circuit (PLC) and Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) technology. Signals coming out of the hybrid ROADM node need not be amplified for a significant distance, thereby adding to the cost-reduction factor. Higher throughput data along with the facility to assign any wavelength (color) to any port at the add/drop site, completely by software control and unattended operation are a few of the advantages of using 'colorless' ROADM architecture.

This research examines ad-hoc networks that have varying node densities. These environments can be found in areas struck by disasters to urban city environments. Mobile nodes would not distribute evenly in such environments. Instead, the nodes would likely concentrate around specific landmarks or areas such as public squares with a high number of pedestrians while connecting roads and highways that have a low density of mobile nodes. The main contribution was the integration of a density based probabilistic scheme on AODV to reduce incurred routing overheads and improve packet delivery without significantly affecting the throughput and end to end delays. The proposed AODV-P (AODV-Probabilistic) protocol was compared against the AODV and OLSR protocols via simulation. The evaluation was based on three different environments: a high density, a variable density and a sparse density. The study showed that the AODV-P had a 28% higher data throughput than AODV and a 42% higher data throughput than OLSR at the three environments. Other performance parameters also showed that AODV-P performed better than AODV or OLSR in sub-optimal network environments due to the improved link lifetimes and lower routing overheads. © 2011/2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Among existing options, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) as a network-based protocol presents higher handover performance comparing with its client-based counterparts such as Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6). Nevertheless, the PMIPv6's operation is limited to a relatively small domain. This motivated researchers to try to extend PMIPv6 operation beyond its local mobility domain, while preserving its network-based nature. However, the existing globally extended PMIPv6 solutions experience longer handover latency and higher packet loss comparing to the original PMIPv6. This paper suggests a low-latency global PMIPv6 scheme, which creates the mobile node's binding record inside the target domain before its real attachment to that domain. The proposed scheme takes advantage of link layer events to initiate IP-level handover in parallel with link reconnection process. The analytical and simulation-base evaluations demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed scheme concerning to the handover latency and packet loss. © 2011 IEEE.","Inter-domain handover; IP Mobility; Network-Based; Proxy Mobile IPv6","Cellular network; Enhanced performance; Handover; Handover latency; Handover performance; Hierarchical Mobile IPv6; Inter-domain handover; IP Mobility; IP mobility scheme; Link layers; Local mobility; Low-latency; Mobile IPv6; Mobile nodes; Mobile wireless network; Network-based; Proxy Mobile IPv6; Subnets; Target domain; Cellular neural networks; Packet loss; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks; Internet protocols",,,,,,,,"Johnson, D., Perkins, C., Arkko, J., (2004) Mobility Support in IPv6, , IETF RFC 3775, June; Soliman, H., Castelluccia, C., El Malki, K., Bellier, L., (2008) Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) Mobility Management, , IETF RFC 5380, Oct; Koodli, R., (2009) Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers, , IETF RFC 5568, Juj; Gundavelli, S., Leung, K., Devarapalli, V., Chowdhury, K., Patil, B., (2008) Proxy Mobile IPv6, , IETF RFC 5213, Aug; Neumann, N., Lei, J., Fu, X., Zhang, G., I-PMIP: An inter-domain mobility extension for proxy-mobile IP Proceedings of the 2009 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing: Connecting the World Wirelessly, Leipzig, Germany, 2009, pp. 994-999; Giaretta, G., (2010) Interactions between PMIPv6 and MIPv6: Scenarios and Related Issues; Draft-ietf-netlmm-mip-interactions-07, , IETF Internet- Draft; (2008) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); Architecture Enhancements for Non-3GPP Accesses, , version 8.2.0 Release 8. vol. 3GPP TS 23.402; IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks - Part 16: Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems - Amendment 2: Physical and Medium Access Control Layers for Combined Fixed and Mobile Operation in Licensed Bands and Corrigendum 1 (2006) IEEE Std 802.16e™-2005 and IEEE Std 802.16™-2004/Cor1-2005, , 28 February; Choi, H., Proxy Mobile IPv6 for Ns-2, , http://commani.net/pmip6ns/; The Network Simulator - 2, , http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/, NS-2; Seamless and Secure Mobility Models for NS-2, , http://www.nist.gov/itl/antd/emntg/ssm_tools.cfm, The National Institute of Standards and Technology; Mussabbir, Q.B., Wenbing, Y., Zeyun, N., Xiaoming, F., Optimized FMIPv6 Using IEEE 802.21 MIH Services in Vehicular Networks (2007) Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 56, pp. 3397-3407","Taghizadeh, A.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 Penang, Malaysia; email: alireza.cod08@student.usm.my",,"IEEE Communication Society Malaysia Chapter;VTS Malaysia;IEEE",,"17th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications, APCC 2011","2 October 2011 through 5 October 2011","Kota Kinabalu, Sabah",88886,,9781457703881,,,"English","Asia-Pac.

Assuming that the transceiver is the most power-consuming component of a typical sensor node, then a large advantage can be achieved at the data link layer where the medium access control (MAC) protocol controls the usage of the radio unit. Many MAC protocols have been developed for traditional wireless networks. Given that the sensor network is different from the traditional wireless network in many places, researchers are looking for a MAC protocol that is specifically designed and adapted to the sensor network. Moreover, most of the contributions in the wireless sensor network have assumed static nodes. However, some applications in the area of medical care and disaster response make use of the mobile sensor network. Thus, the present paper studies and simulates the sensor MAC (S-MAC), timeout MAC and mobility-aware S-MAC (MS-MAC) protocols in terms of their energy efficiency in different mobility situations. Furthermore, an enhancement of the MS-MAC protocol, named as enhanced MS-MAC, is introduced and simulated. The results show that this enhancement can significantly improve the energy efficiency when there is a reasonable packet delivery rate. © The Author 2011.

Criminals lure online users into revealing their passwords or account numbers by sending e-mails as if they come legitimately from financial organizations; these users in turn update and/or provide their account and billing information. In the current study, propose a novel concept that adapts the Evolving Clustering Method for Classification (ECMC) to build new model called the Phishing Evolving Clustering Method (PECM). PECM functions are based on the level of similarity between two groups of features of phishing e-mails. PECM model proved highly effective in terms of classifying e-mails into phishing e-mails or ham e-mails in online mode, speed and use of a one-pass algorithm. PECM also proved its capability to classify e-mail by decreasing the level of false positive and false negative rates while increasing the level of accuracy to 99.7%. The model was built to work in online mode and can learn continuously without consuming too much memory because it works on a one-pass algorithm. Therefore, data are accessed one time from the memory and then the rule is created depending on the evolution of the profile if the characteristics of the phishing e-mail have been changed.

Energy efficiency is a key characteristic of todays wireless sensors. In energy constraint sensor network, mobility handling can cause some additional challenges in sensor protocol design. Recently there are many MAC protocols have been proposed and adopted specially for sensor networks. Most of the proposed MAC protocols in wireless sensor network assumed nodes to be static. However some application like medical care and disaster response make use of mobile sensors essential. In this paper, we take closer look at S-MAC, T-MAC (which are well-known energy efficient MAC protocols) and IEEE 802.15.4 (which is the ZigBee standard) MAC protocols and studies their performance in terms of energy efficiency in different situation of mobility. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Disaster recovery; Disaster response; Energy constraint; Energy efficient MAC; Environmental Monitoring; IEEE 802.15.4; Key characteristics; MAC protocol; Medium access control protocols; Mobile sensors; Protocol design; Wireless sensor; ZigBee standard; Computer science; Information science; Medium access control; Network protocols; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Standards; Wireless networks; Energy efficiency",,,,,,,,"Stann, F., Heidemann, J., RMST: Reliable data transport in sensor networks (2003) Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Sensor Net Protocols and Applications, pp. 102-112; Schwiebert, L., Gupta, S.K.S., Weinmann, J., Research challenges in wireless networks of biomedical sensors (2001) Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM, pp. 151-165; Feller, S.D., Tracking and imaging humans on heterogeneous infrared sensor arrays for law enforcement applications (2002) Fitzpatrick Center for Photonics and Communication Systems and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, , Duke University, Durham, NC, vol. 27708; Mainwaring, A., Wireless sensor networks for habitat monitoring (2002) Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks and Applications, pp. 88-97; Demirkol, I., Ersoy, C., Alagoz, F., MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks: A survey (2006) IEEE Communications Magazine, 44 (4), pp. 115-121. , DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2006.1632658; Ye, W., Medium access control with coordinated adaptive sleeping for wireless sensor networks (2004) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN), 12, p. 506; Van Dam, T., Langendoen, K., (2003) An Adaptive Energy-efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks, pp. 171-180; (2003) IEEE 802.15.4 Standard, , http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.15.4-2003.pdf; Castalia Simulator, , http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au/; http://www.omnetpp.org/; Chipcon, A., (2004) CC2420 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15. 4/ZigBee-ready RF Transceiver, 4. , Chipcon AS, Oslo, Norway","Zareei, M.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: mza09_sa0008@student.usm.my",,"IEEE Advancing Technology for Humanity;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Malaysia Computer Chapter;IEEE Malaysia;IEEE Malaysia Power Electron.

However, the threat of intruders on Internet services is prevalent. This paper proposes a distributed edge-to-edge complementary approach for intrusion detection in a DiffServ/MPLS domain. The QoS metrics are inspected at the edges routers to determine anomalous behavior in the network traffic. Consumed ratios of one-way delay variation (OWDV) and packet loss are computed to monitor service level agreement (SLA) violations. The bandwidth ratio is measured to differentiate abnormal from normal traffic as well as to detect multiple intrusions launched simultaneously. We employed SLA as a comparison scale to infer the deviation between the users consumed ratios and the predefined ratios in the SLA. Service violation occurs and intrusion may be launched when the predefined ratios are exceeded. The complementary services of DiffServ and MPLS techniques guarantee accurate measurements, whereas the complementary measurements of active and passive techniques immunize network performance against scalability limitation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of monitoring SLA violations and can filter out traffic of intruders who breach SLA without disturbing the normal traffic of legitimate users. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although satellite network plays a vital role in providing coverage over the surface of the earth, Line-Of-Sight (LOS) is still an obstacle in satellite communications. Thus a hybrid network between satellite and terrestrial wireless systems (IEEE802.16 WiMAX) will be the key to affordable services that can provide broadband connectivity to rural and remote areas. In this paper, a header compression scheme is proposed over hybrid satellite-WiMAX network. The proposed header compression scheme (Hybrid-ROHC or in short H-ROHC) will enable the saving of resources over the hybrid network where bandwidth is a premium. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","H-ROHC; Header Compression; Hybrid Network; IEEE802.16 WiMAX; Satellite Communication","H-ROHC; Header compression; Hybrid network; IEEE802.16; Satellite Communication; Bandwidth compression; Cold heading; Communication; Satellite communication systems; Satellites; Semantic Web; Semantics; User interfaces; Wimax; Wide area networks",,,,,,,,"(2006) IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks, Air Interface for Fixed Broadband Wireless Access Systems.

MANETs are especially popular in locations that lack a fixed communication infrastructure. To achieve zero-configuration MANETs, as well as quick and easy access to network resources, resources must be well managed by the network. This paper proposes a hierarchical service discovery and advertisement protocol (HSDAP) implemented in the routing layer. HSDAP queries services by piggybacking service REQuest (SREQ) packets on routing packets to reduce overhead and energy consumption. We extend the cluster-based routing protocol (CBRP) to improve service management hierarchy. Simulation results show that adding service discovery and advertisement (SDA) functions to CBRP does not significantly affect overhead. SDA overhead, routing overhead, energy consumption, and SDA delay are significantly less than the extended zone routing protocol. Furthermore, SDA hit ratio of the proposed protocol is greater than 86% for various levels of mobility. The proposed HSDAP is robust and scalable. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is notable that security in this area is still a challenging issue. Without having a trusted public authority, designing suitable security for this type of networking is troublesome. One of the important issues in security mechanisms which is based on RSA algorithms is the support of key-management infrastructure based on the concept of a certificate authority (CA). In this paper, we have employed the Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) as a Routing layer protocol to use unique features of the Cluster Based MANETs and to avoid traffic flooding. CBRP is a robust/scalable routing protocol for medium and large MANETs. We have also employed the cross-layering technique to reduce the number of exchanging packets and increase the speed of the network. In addition, we have introduced a new security key management mechanism based on the CA distribution in MANETs. We introduced a distributed CA mechanism based on cluster-based architecture to create a secure network that is highly adapted to the characteristics of ad hoc networks. Our experiment showed that the proposed protocol does not generate significant overhead in the network. The average energy consumption and end-to-end delay in this protocol are less than the Authentication Protocol Based on CBRP (APBC). © King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals 2010.","Certificate authority; Key management; Mobile ad hoc network; Routing protocol",,,,,,,,,"Varadharajan, V., Shankaran, R., Hitchens, M., Security for cluster based ad hoc networks (2004) Comput Commun, 27, pp. 488-501; Ge, R., Crescenzo, D., Fecko, G., Samtani, M., Efficient and secure indirect-address service discovery in MANET (2005) IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2005, 3, pp. 1514-1520; Xia, P., Wu, M., Wang, K., Chen, X., Identity-based fully distributed certificate authority in an OLSR MANET (2008) IEEE Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM), 2008, pp. 1-4; Zhou, H., Mutka, M.W., Ni, L.M., Multiple-key cryptography-based distributed certificate authority in mobile ad-hoc networks (2005) IEEE GLOBCOM Conference, pp. 1681-1685; Zefreh, M.S., Fanian, A., Sajadieh, S.M., Berenjkoub, M., Khadivi, P., A distributed certificate authority and key establishment protocol for mobile ad hoc networks (2008) IEEE ICACT 2008, pp. 1157-1162; Hahn, G., Nyang, D., Song, J., Lee, J.-I., Park, B., Secure cluster based routing protocol incorporating the distributed PKI mechanisms (2004) IEEE MELECON 2004, pp. 787-790; Shamir, A., How to share a secret (1979) Commun ACM, 22, pp. 612-613; Desmedt, Y., Frankel, Y., Threshold cryptosystems (1989) Lecture notes in computer science & Crypto, 89 (435), pp. 307-315; Lee, K.-H., Suh, H.-S., Han, S.-B., Lee, S., Hwang, C.-S., An authentication protocol based on CBRP in ad hoc network (2004) The 6th international conference on advanced communication technology, pp. 407-412; Chiang, W.-C., Wu, H.-K., Gerla, M., Routing in Clustered Multihop, MobileWireless Networks with Fading Channel (1997) IEEE SICON Conference, pp. 197-211; Boukerche, A., Simulation-based performance comparison of routing protocols formobile ad hoc networks (2002) Simulation, 78, p. 7; Perkins, C.E., Royer, E.M., Das, S.R., Marina, M.K., Performance comparison of two on-demand routing protocols for ad hoc networks (2001) Pers Commun IEEE, 7, pp. 116-129; Moghim, N., Hendessi, F., Movehhedinia, N., Gulliver, T.A., Ad-Hoc wireless network routing protocols and improved AODV (2003) Arab J Sci Eng, 28, pp. 99-114; Abolhasan, M., Wysocki, T., Dutkiewicz, E., Liu, C., Kaiser, J., A review of routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (2004) Ad hoc Netw, 2, pp. 1-22; Jiang, M., Li, J., Tay, Y.C., (1999) Cluster based routing protocol(CBRP) (INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-manet-cbrp-spec-01.txt)., pp. 1-27. , National University of Singapore, I.

Meanwhile, the popularity of Real time SWitching (RSWJ) has increased due to its ability to easily combine voice and video services. Incidentally, these two heterogeneous clients pose considerable problems for users who have to choose between two solutions offering different advantages and disadvantages. While RSW is being used in many areas, lAX is being deployed in many VoIP products. Hence, RSW interoperability and coenstence with lAX is considered very important when manmizing the return on current investments and to support new deployments that could be RSW as an alternative packet telephony signaling protocol. We used lAX as opposed to SIP, which although started as a simple and an attractive method for VoIP, has become a complei and heavy protocol to implement. Similarly, H.323 is a very complei protocol suite that can result in the transmission of many unnecessary messages across the network.

IETF Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) has been chosen by wireless telecommunication industry to handle IP-level handover. PMIPv6 uses binding update between mobility agents to keep Mobile Node (MN) reachability during mobility session. Considering distance between these mobility agents, individual binding update could result excessive signal. To reduce this cost and increase scalability of IP-level handover procedures, here in this paper we extend PMIPv6 protocol with an Aggregated Proxy Binding Update (A-PBU) scheme. We also propose an algorithm to group MNs with imminent handover, based on link layer intelligence provided by IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH). A movement equation derived from Fluid-flow model has been used to estimate signaling cost of proposed A-PBU scheme. Quantitative results show a significant reduction in handover signaling cost comparing similar function in base protocol. © 2010 ACM.","aggregated binding; group mobility; handover","aggregated binding; Base protocols; Binding update; Cellular network; Cellular wireless networks; Group mobility; Handover; IEEE802.21; Link layers; Media independent handover; Mobile nodes; Mobility agents; Movement equations; Proxy Mobile IPv6; Quantitative result; Reachability; Scalable networks; Signaling costs; Wireless telecommunication industry; Aggregates; Cellular neural networks; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Mobile telecommunication systems; Telecommunication industry; Internet protocols",,,,,,,,"Cai, X., Liu, F., Network Selection for Group Handover in Multi-Access Networks (2008) Communications, 2008.

Approach: One of the key concerns of WiMAX operators is how many users they can support for an access area where the number of users and the amount of data that can be delivered to the end user depends on the available system capacity. Results: This scenario is even more complex when multi-hop relays are introduced into the network whereas the user access capacity decreases with the increase of hop number. Therefore, to maintain and satisfy QoS demands from various users in a multi-hop relay network, it is essential to control and determine the number of users connect to each zone in regards to different levels of QoS. In this study a system capacity control technique was presented for IEEE 802.16j relay network to control the number of users that connect to the network and calculate the system capacity in terms of a three level relay topology. We presented a simple mathematical analysis of the proposed technique as well as delay analysis of the relay network. Conclusion/Recommendations: The analytical results showed that the proposed technique has achieved the objective of this study. Controlling and determining the number of user is very crucial in order to maximize the throughput for each individual user requirement of QoS, maintain fairness between users in the networks and guarantee QoS for real time application users. © 2010 Science Publications.","Delay; IEEE 802.16j; Qos; Throughput; WiMAX",,,,,,,"Chakchai, S.I., Jain, R., Tamimi, A.K., Capacity evaluation for IEEE 802. 16e mobile WiMAX (2010) J.

In this paper, we proposed a new AP-driven load balancing scheme which utilizes the capabilities of cognitive radio (CR) techniques based on cell breathing.

This scenario is even more complex when multi-hop relays are introduced into the network whereas the user access capacity decreases with the increase of hop number. In order to maintain the QoS in WiMAX multi-hop relay network, it is essential to control and determine the number of users connect to each zone in regards to different levels of QoS. In this paper a Flexible System Capacity Control (FSCC) technique is proposed for WiMAX Multi-hop Relay network to control the number of users that connect to the network and calculate the system capacity in terms of a three level relay topology. We present detailed mathematical analysis of the FSCC. The FSCC control the number of users at each wireless zone by the use of different control parameters ∝ and accept or reject users at each relay based on the predefined allocated number of users for each relay and the total system capacity. The analytical result shows that the FSCC has achieved the objective of this study. Controlling and determining the number of user is very crucial in order to maximize the throughput for each individual user requirement of QoS, maintain fairness between users in the networks and guarantee QoS for real time application users. © 2010 IEEE.","IEEE 802.16j; QoS; System capacity; Throughput; WiMAX","Analytical results; Control parameters; End users; Flexible system; Hop number; IEEE 802.16j; Mathematical analysis; Multi-hop relay; Multi-hop relay networks; QoS; QoS requirements; Real-time application; System Capacity; User access; User requirements; WiMAX systems; Computer science; Control system analysis; Information technology; Radio links; Relay control systems; Throughput; Wimax; Quality of service",,,,,,"(2004) IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks Part 16: Air Interface for Fixed Broadband Wireless Access Systems, , IEEE Std 802.16-2004, Oct; http://wirelessman.orglrelay/, IEEE 802.16's Relay Task Group, [Online], Available; 802.16j (Mobile Multihop Relay) Usage Models, , http://www.ieee802.orglI6/relay/contrib/C80216j-06026.pdf, IEEE C802.16j-06/026, [Online], Available; Harmonized Contribution on 802. 1 6j (Mobile Multihop Relay) Usage Models, , http://www.ieee802.orglI6/relay/docs/80216j-06_015.pdf, IEEE 802.16j-06/0IS, 2006.

WiMAX provides broadband access for services having different QoS requirements and different traffic priorities. However, it is the responsibility of the medium access control (MAC) layer to schedule the traffic flows and allocate bandwidth such that the QoS requirements of each flow is satisfied. This scenario is even more complex when multi-hop relays were introduced into the network. Nonetheless, the IEEE 802.16j standard does not specify any QoS scheduling architectures. In this paper, we propose a Scalable QoS Scheduling Architecture (SQSA) for IEEE 802.16j networks in order to (I) guarantee QoS demands of different applications, (2) find the appropriate QoS that each flow requests and to ensure this QoS. The SQSA is fully compliant QoS architecture; we present complete description of the SQSA modules and functions. © 2010 IEEE.","Bandwidth allocation; IEEE 802.16j; Multihop relay; QoS; Scheduling","Bandwidth allocations; Broadband access; Coverage area; IEEE 802.16j; Medium access control layer; Multi-hop relay; Multi-hop relay networks; QoS; QoS architecture; QoS demands; QoS requirements; Relay stations; Scheduling architecture; Traffic flow; Bandwidth; Medium access control; Network architecture; Network protocols; Radio links; Scheduling; Traffic surveys; Wimax; Quality of service",,,,,,"(2004) IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks Part 16: Air Interface for Fixed Broadband Wireless Access Systems, , IEEE Std S02.16-2004, Oct; (2009) IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks Part 16: Air Interface for Broadband Wireless Access Systems Amendment I: Multiple Relay Specification (2009), pp. cl-290. , IEEE Std S02.16j-2009, IEEE Std S02.16j-2009 (Amendment to IEEE Std S02.16-2009), June; Genc, V., Murphy, S., U, Y.Y., Murphy, J., IEEE 802.16J relay based wireless access networks: An overview (2008) IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine, 15 (5), pp. 56-63. , October; http://wirelessman.org/relay, IEEE S02.16's Relay Task Group, [Online].

MPLS (Multi Protocol Label switching) has been integrated into Mobile IP schemes to lessen the burden of IP packets tunneling in mobility domain. In this paper we presented a review of more prominent and mostly cited combinational proposals of MPLS and Mobile IP. To reach a comparative sense, a general taxonomy based on three important aspects of this combination was suggested: Integration level, Hierarchical or non-hierarchical structure and length of MPLS tunnels.

Moreover, it investigates performance of new proposed priority PAUSE, which includes two new flexible programmable fields (predetermined pause time and priority) in order to provide granular flow control. The proposed PPFC is fair in the sense that it distributes the resources among the flows based on their priorities during congestion. Moreover it reduces the amount of buffer overflow and packet loss and it would provide an efficient use of link bandwidth with high throughput. In addition, priority PAUSE enables optimal bandwidth management of virtual channel for different IPv6 traffic priorities and it enhances the QoS in Metro Ethernet. © 2010 IEEE.","Buffer management; Fair bandwidth allocation priority PAUSE; Hybrid IPv6 flow label; Virtual channels","Bandwidth management; Buffer management; Buffer overflows; Fair bandwidth allocation; Fair bandwidth allocation priority PAUSE; Granular flows; High throughput; IPv6 traffic; Link bandwidth; Metro Ethernets; Physical channels; QoS parameters; Virtual channels; Communication channels (information theory); Ethernet; Flow control; Frequency allocation; Internet protocols; Labels; Bandwidth",,,,,,"Pahlevanzadeh, B., Seno Hosseini, S.A., Wan, T.C., Budiarto, R., Comparative study on the development of ethernet flow control (2008) Proc. of the 2nd International Conference on Sciences and Technology (ICSTIE2008), , Malaysia; De Silva, R., Congestion control of elastic traffic in high speed 10GbE WANs (2003) Internal Tech.

Consequently, mobile ad hoc networks and their applications have become feasible with the proliferation of light-weight mobile devices. Many protocols have been developed to handle service discovery and routing in ad hoc networks. However, the majority of them did not consider one critical aspect of this type of network, which is the limited of available energy in each node. Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a robust/scalable routing protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) and superior to existing protocols such as Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) in terms of throughput and overhead. Therefore, based on this strength, methods to increase the efficiency of energy usage are incorporated into CBRP in this work. In order to increase the stability (in term of life-time) of the network and to decrease the energy consumption of inter-cluster gateway nodes, an Enhanced Gateway Cluster Based Routing Protocol (EGCBRP) is proposed. Three methods have been introduced by EGCBRP as enhancements to the CBRP: improving the election of cluster Heads (CHs) in CBRP which is based on the maximum available energy level, implementing load balancing for inter-cluster traffic using multiple gateways, and implementing sleep state for gateway nodes to further save the energy. Furthermore, we propose an Energy Efficient Cluster Based Routing Protocol (EECBRP) which extends the EGCBRP sleep state concept into all idle member nodes, excluding the active nodes in all clusters. The experiment results show that the EGCBRP decreases the overall energy consumption of the gateway nodes up to 10% and the EECBRP reduces the energy consumption of the member nodes up to 60%, both of which in turn contribute to stabilizing the network.

Unfortunately, wireless ad hoc networks suffer from some limitations related to the bandwidth leakage. So a proper data flow mechanism should be used to save the bandwidth consumption. So we proposed an XCAST based routing protocol (P-XCAST) to be used in wireless ad hoc networks, but XCAST was initially designed for wired network and there is an absence of software implementation. Our P-XCAST routing protocol is based on modifying route request control packets mechanism to build the network topology and route the data packet which hold the list of destination by classify the P-XCAST list of destinations according to similarity on their hop count number, to minimize the bandwidth consumption by sending one data packet instead of sending n packets equal to n destinations. In this paper, we have tested P-XCAST QoS parameters using background many-to-many applications under different groups' size and compare these results with AoDV and WRP routing protocols. The results of simulation reflect a better QoS performance parameters compared with AoDV and WRP routing protocols. ©2009 IEEE.","AODV; Component; MANETs; ODMRP; PDR; PTT; PXCAST; QoS; WRP; XCAST","Bandwidth consumption; Control packets; Data flow; Data packet; Hop count; Network infrastructure; Network topology; Performance parameters; QoS parameters; Route requests; Software implementation; Wired networks; Bandwidth; Electric network topology; Mobile telecommunication systems; Routing protocols; Water treatment plants; Wireless ad hoc networks; Ad hoc networks",,,,,,"Novatnack, J., Greenwald, L., Arora, H., Evaluating Ad Hoc Routing Protocols with Respect to Quality of Service (2005) IEEE Communications Magazine, 3 (22-24), pp. 205-212. , Aug; Perkins, C.E., Belding-Royer, E.M., Das, S., Ad Hoc on Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing (2002) IETF Internet Draft, , draft-ietf-manet-AODV-10.txt, March (Work in Progress); Clausen, T., Jacquet, P., (2003) Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, , RFC3626, October; Lee, S.-J., Gerla, M., Chiang, C.-C., On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol Proc.

In particular, we address the issue of optimizing AP transmission power and channel allocation within the network. The aim is to optimize the overall network performance by adjusting the transmission power of the APs and minimizing the non-adjacent co-channel interference in an extended service set (ESS) area. The goal of CR is to use the heuristic approach in sharing the spectrum among the active nodes without degradation in the network performance. In order to have a successful data transmission among the active nodes, an efficient transmission power adjustment algorithm is needed. The algorithm considers the overall power distribution between an AP and another co-channel non-adjacent AP using CR techniques as well as control the switching to other APs to optimize the overall network performance. ©2009 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; ESS; Power adjustment; Wi-Fi","Access points; Active node; Adjustment algorithms; Cognitive radio; Data transmission; Extended service sets; Heuristic approach; IEEE802.11 WLAN; Power distributions; Transmission power; Network performance; Optimization; Packet networks; Standards; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Radio",,,,,,"Vanhatupa, T., Hannikainen, M., Hamalainen, T.D., Evaluation of throughput estimation models and algorithms for WLAN frequency planning (2006) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Wired/wireless Networks Waterloo, Ontario, , Canada: ACM; (2007) Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, , IEEE802.11, Edition; Xu, K., Gerla, M., Bae, S., How Effective is the IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS Handshake in Ad Hoc Networks?

We also use a clustering routing protocol to avoid flooding. To reduce message communication we move service advertisement from application layer to routing layer. In this case service advertisement piggybacked hello message and these two processes takes place simultaneous. Our experiment shows that this manner does not have significant overhead. © 2009 IEEE.","CBRP; MANETs; Routing Protocol; Service Advertisement","Application layers; CBRP; Clustering routing protocol; Communication messages; Hello message; MANETs; Message communication; New position; Resources information; Routing layers; Service Advertisement; Service advertisements; Ad hoc networks; Mobile ad hoc networks; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Routing protocols",,,,,,"Cho, C., Lee, D., Survey of Service Discovery Architectures for Mobile Ad hoc Networks Term paper, Mobile Computing, CEN 5531, , http://www.cise.ufl.edu/class/cen5531fa05, Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering CICE, University of Florida, Fall 2005; (2000) UPnP: Understanding Universal Plug and Play, , http://www.upnp.org; M.

Thus, making traffic management and quality of service approaches for optimization of the Internet become a challenging area of research; meanwhile flow control and congestion control will be considered as significantfundamentals for the tramc control especially on the high speed network (in the range of Gigabit Ethernet family). The existing IEEE802.3x standard which is applicable to all version of full-duplex Ethernet uses PAUSE frames as MAC control frames to enable or disable frame transmission. As a result regulating data flow at the low level of OSI model assists in minimizing frame loss and preventing latency due to error recovery at the higher layer protocols. However some problems encountered; for instance, it does not distinguish the well-behaved stations from misbehaved stations and it causes a head-of-line problem. Moreover, there is no priority awareness all traffic get equal punishment. The adding overhead and other problems associated with IEEE802.3x have made it become inefficient. Realizing the studies to overcome the problems become important has motivated us to propose a new format of PAUSE frame through an ntelligent switch, which includes some new flexible programmable fields, such as predetermined pausetime for particular traffics. So our proposed intelligent switches with its new PAUSE frame are able to distinguish between different types of traffic and in turn, both new PAUSE frame and intelligent switchtogether provide an efficient flow control approach for high speed networks. © 2008 IEEE.","Congestion control; IEEE802.3x flow control; Intelligent switch; Priority","Data flow analysis; Ethernet; HIgh speed networks; Intelligent networks; Internet; Internet protocols; OSI model; Switches; Congestion control; Control approaches; Control frames; Data flows; Error recoveries; Frame loss; Frame transmissions; Full duplexes; Giga bit ethernets; Head of lines; Higher-layer protocols; IEEE802.3x flow control; Intelligent switch; Internet communications; Low levels; New approaches; Priority; Quality-of-service; Traffic managements; Flow control",,,,,,"Pouzin, L., Flow control in Data networks-Methods and tools (1976) Proc.

However MPE has some disadvantages in simplicity and efficiency to support next generation network. The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) is a new solution to overcome limitations of MPE. In ULE, packets are layered directly into the payload field of MPEG-2 TS frames. This is a new encapsulation method for the transport of IPv4 and other network protocol packets directly over MPEG-2 TS. In this paper, we describe the principles and the benefits of ULE and we also proposed Robust Header Compression Scheme to work with ULE in order to enhance the performance of existing ULE. This paper also provides a simulation analysis to show that the new proposed method can offer a better performance in delay, throughput and overhead especially when the packet size is small. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,"Computer simulation; Packet networks; Robust control; Satellite communication systems; Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE); Next generation networks; Robust Header Compression; Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation; Internet protocols",,,,,,"Fairhurst, G., et al.: Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) for Transmission of IP Datagrams over an MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) [Online], RFC 4326.

This standard was developed to work in all-wireless environment supporting either peer-to-peer or star network topology. Since the release of IEEE 802.15.4, several efforts were made to study its performance where simple star network topology was the main focus. This literature attempts to extend existing efforts but focuses on evaluating the performance of peer-to-peer networks on a small scale basis using ns2 simulator. We analyze the performance based on commonly known metrics such as throughput, packet delivery ratio, and average delay. In addition, we propose ad hoc wireless sensor networks (AD-WSNs) paradigm as part of the extension to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. From the experiments conducted we identified 'hidden node' problem in high-rate traffic as a soruce for performance degradation and proposed slot-based channel access as the potential solution. © 2006 IEEE.","Ad hoc networks; IEEE 802.15.4; Wireless personal area networks; Wireless sensor networks","Channel capacity; Computer simulation; Network protocols; Telecommunication traffic; Multiple sourcess; Performance evaluation; Star networks; Ad hoc networks",,,,,,"IEEE 802.15.4, Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs), IEEE NY, August 2003; Zheng, J., Lee, M.J., (2004) A Comprehensive Performance Study of 802.15.4, , IEEE Press Book; Lu, G., Krishnamachari, B., Raghavendra, C.S., Performance Evaluation of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC for Low-Rate Wireless Networks (2004) Proc.

The focus in this study centers on the relationship between the mobility, density and connectivity of ad hoc wireless nodes. Ad hoc wireless node density is often discussed on a single group subnets of nodes. In this study a scenario is proposed to evaluate the ad hoc wireless nodes communicating between different node sub with different densities. A simulation is conducted using the two prominent on demand routing protocol for ad hoc networks namely DSR and AODV. In the simulation each protocol is given 2 different scenarios in terms of node location. The first scenario is a normal ad hoc wireless simulation scenario. The second scenario contains nodes that are partitioned into 7 areas where respective areas have their node density and connection probability. The objective of this study is to look at how on demand ad hoc wireless routing protocols react to environments with non uniform node densities and to seek and understanding for future improvement. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Computer simulation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Probability; Routers; Ad hoc wireless routing protocols; Connection probability; Node density; Network protocols",,,,,,"Bettstetter, C., On the Connectivity of Wireless Multihop Networks with Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous Range Assignment (2002) Proceedings.

The study of QoS issues in MANETs is vital for supporting multimedia and real-time applications. MANETs can provide multimedia users with mobility they demand, if efficient QoS multicasting strategies were developed. In this paper, we study QoS requirements, illustrate advantages and limitations of existing QoS routing protocol and propose a QoS Multicast Routing protocol (QMR) with a flexible hybrid scheme for QoS multicast routing. The hybrid scheme contains some mechanisms that provide fix-reservation and shared-reservation bandwidth to guarantee QoS multicast routing. The proposed protocol uses forward nodes to apply QoS multicast routing from source(s) to a group of destinations and support load balancing. Analysis results show the ability of QMR to exploit residual bandwidth efficiently without effect on the reserved bandwidth and provide a balance between performance gains and design complexity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Multimedia systems; Quality of service; Routers; Telecommunication networks; Design complexity; Group-oriented computing; Mobile Ad hoc networks; QoS Multicast Routing protocol (QMR); Network protocols",,,,,,"Lin, C.-R., On-demand QoS routing in multi-hop mobile networks (2001) Proceedings of the IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1735-1744; Chlamtac, I., Conti, M., Liu, J.J.-N., (2003) Mobile Ad Hoc Networking: Imperatives and Challenges, 1 (1), pp. 13-64. , Ad hoc Networks Publication; Setton, E., Yoo, T., Zhu, X., Goldsmith, A., Girod, B., Cross-layer design of Ad hoc networks for real-time video streaming (2005) IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine, , To Appear; Pagani, E., Rossi, G.P., A Framework for the admission control of QoS multicast traffic in mobile Ad hoc networks (2001) Proc.

Typical topologies include hub and spoke (star) topologies or bidirectional full mesh topologies. These topologies are not spectrum efficient since they do not fully utilize the broadcast nature of radio frequency (RF) communications. In addition, the two-hop link delays in star topologies impact the deployment of real time multimedia applications. It is possible to design a hybrid frequency division multiple access (FDMA) satellite network that fully utilize the broadcast nature of satellite links to achieve good spectrum efficiency while providing quality of service (QoS) support in the channel using unidirectional links (UDL). This is achieved using IP over digital video broadcast via satellite (IP over DVB-S), which represents a low cost means of building an interactive broadband satellite-based network compared with older technologies. The design issues for a low cost UDL mesh satellite network are discussed in this paper. © 2003 IEEE.","Costs; Digital video broadcasting; IP networks; Multimedia communication; Network topology; Protocols; Quality of service; Radio broadcasting; Radio frequency; Satellite broadcasting","Broadcasting; Computer graphics; Costs; Digital multimedia broadcasting; Digital radio; Frequency division multiple access; Internet protocols; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Multimedia systems; Network protocols; Quality of service; Radio broadcasting; Radio waves; Satellite links; Satellites; Stars; Topology; IP networks; Multi-media communications; Network topology; Radio frequencies; Satellite broadcasting; Digital video broadcasting (DVB)",,,,,,"Duros, E., Dabbous, W., (2001) A Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanism for Unidirectional Links, , RFC 3077, IETF, March; Hu, Y., Victor, O., Li, K., Satellite-Based Internet: A Tutorial (2001) IEEE Commun.

However, the increased use of SNMP to manage and control network resources such as routers and servers also introduces security risks whereby unauthorized users can retrieve information or modify the given resources remotely. The basic security framework introduced in SNMPv3 only specifies the use of symmetric cryptography techniques to address the security concerns. This paper outlines a new methodology, Public-Key Security Model (PSM), to integrate public cryptography techniques into the SNMP framework. It extends the existing User-based Security Model (USM) to include per-session authentication and encryption keys, thus enhancing the security of the SNMPv3 protocol.",,"Computer privacy; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Public key cryptography; Simple network management protocols (SNMP); Security of data",,,,,,,"Wan, Tat Chee; Univ of Science Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia",,"IEEE",,"2000 TENCON Proceedings","24 September 2000 through 27 September 2000","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",57943,,,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034428914
