If this platform is fully utilized by farmers, it can improve the sustainability of farmers in agriculture industry because it can improve sales volume and fair price for farmers and consumers. However, the current AgroBazaar Online has a few enhancements that can be proposed to improve the acceptance from farmers and consumers. Therefore, there is a need to design the system that can encourage target users to use the system and make the system easy to be used by farmers who relatively have lower ICT literacy. The main requirement to develop intelligent marketing is data to provide intelligent information and services for both farmers and consumers. This project aims to explore data strategies to provide intelligent digital agricultural marketplace based on cloud data platform. This research proposes to develop cloud data platform for e-marketplace based cloud data platform approach. The proposed methodology consists of six phases: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. This paper proposes an architectural model of agriculture marketplace cloud based on cloud data platform. The architectural model will be used for development of e-marketplace that fulfil the Malaysia's IR 4.0 policy and National Agro-Food Policy (NAFP). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Agricultural robots; Architecture; Commerce; Agriculture industries; Architectural modeling; Design and Development; Digital marketplace; E-marketplaces; Intelligent information; Problem identification; Sales volume; Agriculture,,,,,,,"Isa, I.

The main task of the cryptographic hash function is to assure the integrity of the transmitted data. In this work, integrity verification methods for digital verses of the Holy Quran are proposed. The first method uses cryptographic hash functions and generate the hash table of the Holy Quran. SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash functions are chosen in this work. The second method is a single compression technique which manipulates data during the run time. The compression method makes use of the two bytes in Unicode UTF-8 for the Arabic characters set. The results show that for a digital copy of the Holy Quran encoded in Unicode UTF-8, the sizes of the hash tables generated by SHA256 and RIPEMD160 are 84.73% and 90.46% (6.55-fold and 10.48-fold) smaller respectively. The compressed version of the Holy Quran has a size of 47.24% (1.9-fold) smaller than the original copy. In addition, a second preimage attack on a hash table for the digital Holy Quran produced by using CRC32 hash function is conducted to study the impact of such attacks on the two hash tables proposed in this work. © 2018 The Authors",Authentication; Cryptography; Data integrity; Hash function; Holy Quran,,,,,,,,"(2013), pp. 250-253. , AlAhmad, Mohammad A., Imad, Alshaikhli, Amal E.

Since the performance of LEACH deteriorates sharply with increasing network size, the challenge for new WSN protocols is to extend the network lifespan while maintaining high scalability. This paper introduces an energy-efficient clustering and hierarchical routing algorithm named energy-efficient scalable routing algorithm (EESRA). The goal of the proposed algorithm is to extend the network lifespan despite an increase in network size. The algorithm adopts a three-layer hierarchy to minimize the cluster heads' load and randomize the selection of cluster heads. Moreover, EESRA uses multi-hop transmissions for intra-cluster communications to implement a hybrid WSN MAC protocol. This paper compares EESRA against other WSN routing protocols in terms of network performance with respect to changes in the network size. The simulation results show that EESRA outperforms the benchmarked protocols in terms of load balancing and energy efficiency on large-scale WSNs. © 2013 IEEE.",Energy efficiency; LEACH; load balancing; scalability; wireless sensor networks,Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Low power electronics; Medium access control; Power management (telecommunication); Resource allocation; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Scalability; Energy efficient; Energy Efficient clustering; Hierarchical routing algorithm; High scalabilities; Intra-cluster communication; Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchies; Multihop transmission; Wsn routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).,"Liu, X., Atypical hierarchical routing Protocols for wireless sensor net-works: A review (2015) IEEE Sensors J., 15 (10), pp. 5372-5383. , Oct; Gherbi, C., Aliouat, Z., Benmohammed, M., A survey on clustering routing Protocols in wireless sensor networks (2017) Sens.

WSN has a broad range of important applications such as environmental monitoring, health monitoring, and various industrial and military applications. The various routing protocols in WSN manage the load balance, energy consumption and the expansion of the network. This study outlines the procedure of developing scalable, low energy and highly adaptive clustering hierarchy routing protocol. The main objective is to maintain the network lifespan over the network expansion. We refer to the proposed protocol as Energy-Efficient Scalable Routing Algorithm (EESRA). The EESRA protocol is expected to optimize the well-known LEACH protocol for more energy efficiency on a large scale WSN. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

However, the consumer adoption of home automation systems has been immensely slow. Moreover, most home automation systems available in the market are designed for western countries and do not have certain features that are crucial for consumers in tropical countries like Malaysia. Therefore, this paper identifies the possible criteria for this slow adoption and evaluates the potential of Intel Galileo for addressing these problems. Four popular home automation technologies are analysed and surveys are conducted to identify the needs of electricity and water consumers in Malaysia. A low cost, secure, user-friendly, easily installed and flexible Intel Galileo based home automation system that caters the needs of Malaysians is presented. The system is integrated with an Android application and uses a Wi-Fi network. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, the design and prototype implementation of a basic home automation system based on the Intel Galileo is developed and evaluated based on several tests and interviews. The proposed system can be used as a reference to increase consumer adoption of home automation systems in tropical countries. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

However, most e-government portals lack in integration and interoperability. This problem causes each government agency tend to have its own portal. Hence, it prevents the government to provide services in a single access point. Therefore, e-government system needs a better architecture for integration and interoperability among e-government system components, applications, and services. The architecture should provide a seamless approach for integration and interoperability of e-government applications and services using a hybrid and distributed e-government architecture.

However, the seamless connectivity in different IP networks has introduced new security vulnerabilities. One of the most critical concerns with the IPv6 is IPv6 routing header. IPv6 routing header can be used by an IPv6 source to list one or more intermediate hosts to be visited on the way to a packet's destination. Nevertheless, the feature of IPv6 routing header which has serious vulnerability can be used by attacker to bypass security policies applied on filtering devices such as firewall. This study analyzes the IPv6 routing header feature which can be exploited by attackers to access the protected hosts/networks. Thus, the current study provides a comprehensive view regarding the scenario of attackers within the different IP wireless networks which in turn provide the researchers and practitioners with the threats of attackers. The scenario analysis also leads to developing new mechanisms for covering the security problem of routing header type 0/2 which is still under investigation. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

However, it does not provide authentication, which may lead to possible impersonation and eavesdropping threats. Negotiating keys using digital certificates may help secure the channel, but this method incurs extra maintenance cost. Verbal authentication utilizes the real-time nature of VoIP but it requires users to read and manually compare the authentication code. This study proposes a session identifier framework based on the Modified Vector Quantization (MVQ) method on real-time video frames for video communication in VoIP.

The framework is certificate-less and users do not need to read the authentication code to the other user.

A reliable security protocol and an authentication scheme are thus required to prevent the aforementioned threats. However, an authentication scheme often demands additional cost and effort. Accordingly, a security framework for known participants in VoIP communication is proposed in this paper. The framework is known as Randomness-Optimized Self-Securing (ROSS), which performs authentication automatically throughout the session by optimizing the uniqueness and randomness of the communication itself. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange and Salsa20 stream cipher are utilized in the framework correspondingly to secure the key agreement and the communication with low computational cost. Human intelligence supports ROSS authentication process to ensure participant authenticity and communication regularity. The results show that with marginal overhead, the proposed framework is able to secure VoIP communication by performing reliable authentication. © 2012 KSII.",Applied cryptography; Low-cost framework; Security & privacy protocol; Self-authentication; VoIP communication,Authentication; Costs; Internet telephony; Random processes; Voice/data communication systems; Applied cryptography; Authentication scheme; Communication framework; Communication regularity; Low costs; Privacy protocols; Self-authentication; Voice over Internet protocol; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Sicker, D.C., Lookabaugh, T., VoIP security: Not an afterthought (2004) Queue, 2, p. 56. , Article (CrossRef Link); Chandrashekar, J., Zhang, Z.L., Duan, Z., Hou, Y.T., Towards a service oriented internet (2006) IEICE Trans.

This paper proposes a one-stop e-government architecture that integrates one-stop portal, e-government service application, and e-government service provider. The architecture provides seamless interoperability of e-government services among different government agencies.

For example, text sort is used in finance to update stock market data. Text data processing consumes huge amounts of memory for storage and computation purposes. Hence we propose a technique to sort huge text data which combines the Radix sort algorithm and the Bucket sort algorithm to obtain a scalable, parallel, and efficient sorting method which can be applied on multiple Graphic Processor Unit (GPU) cards. The basic idea is to divide the text data into multiple buckets and then sort individual buckets in different GPUs in parallel eventually merging the sorted bucket into a final sorted result. On individual GPUs, we will implement Radix sort which will convert text (ASCII) into integers and perform sorting using this algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.",Bucket Sort; CUDA; GPGPU; Multiple GPU; Radix sort,Control systems; Digital storage; Electronic trading; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Bucket sort; CUDA; GPGPU; Graphic processor units; Radix sort; Sorting method; Text data; Sorting,,,,,,,"(2012) Apache Software, , October) hadoop.apache.org; Satish, N., Harris, M., Garland, M., Designing efficient sorting algorithms for manycore gpus,"" in (2009) Parallel & Distributed Processing1 2009.

In order to fulfill this role, it requires collaboration with other government agencies and businesses to provide an effective one-stop center for users to access and perform various services. Current e-government portals are mostly lack of interoperability whereby users still need to access government services from various portals or websites. Interoperability is a technical requirement to achieve government services collaboration and integration. There are many challenges and approaches to achieve better interoperability in e-government portals. Architecture-based and model-based approaches are essential research areas that can improve interoperability starting from the planning stages. Architecture provides overall overview of e-government components and relationship between components. This paper systematically reviews current architecture-based approaches to find a suitable approach and its requirements to produce a better architecture for e-government portal based on the lessons learned from the previous works. © 2011 IEEE.",E-government Portal; Interoperability; Software Architecture; Systematic literature review,e-Government; E-Government portals; Government agencies; Government services; Model based approach; One stop; Planning stages; Research areas; Systematic literature review; Technical requirement; Architecture; Government data processing; Portals; Software architecture; Interoperability,,,,,,,"(2010) E-government Survey 2010, , United Nations, United Nations; Ke, W., Wei, K.K., Successful e-government in Singapore (2004) Commun.
