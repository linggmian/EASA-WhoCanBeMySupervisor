This is one of the early attempts to explicate and describe the patterns of published articles of PEB in the field of Computer Science. From the first article traced in 1976 until 2019, the total numbers of published documents related to pro-environmental behaviour across all disciplines are 2276. However, only 97 documents were found in the field of Computer Science. It is noted that the integration of PEB in Computer Science has indicated an exponential increase in annual publication rate and this trend appears to be evident in developed countries. Specifically, the analysis of productivity according to country/region, institution and funding sponsor suggested that the research landscapes in particularly in Malaysia are paying attention to the intersection of PEB and Computer Sciences. The exploration in the type of publication, source of publication, keyword and language analysis provided the orientation, status and trends of the topic and potential hints to future studies in this field. Overall, progressive trends in publications suggest that the integration of the topic would be continuously published and studied in Malaysia as well as among the international community. © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Behavioural; Bibliometric; Scopus; Sustainability; Trends",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

This paper aims to investigate the factors determining user satisfaction with a summative e-assessment system in Nigeria from the examinees' point of view, and to address the challenges and problems faced during the e-assessment. Therefore, the research adopts a qualitative approach (by interview) to provide a further understanding of the main factors which affect user satisfaction with eassessment. Secondly, to map those identified issues with a corresponding objective and subjective aspects of satisfaction. As a result, this could set the stage right for future studies on resolving issues and enhancing the e-assessment satisfaction. This study showed that the satisfaction of examinees with e-assessment would be influence by service quality, system quality, and user's computer experience. In contrast, information quality was found to be an insignificant determinant of user satisfaction with summative e-assessment. Past studies mostly address the relationship between these factors and user satisfaction quantitatively. This study reveals that Information System Success Model is the most suited underlying theory that could fit the case of e-assessment satisfaction. © 2005 JATIT and LLS.","Computer Experience; Service Quality; Summative E-Assessment; System Quality; User Satisfaction",,,,,,,,,"Ayo, C.

The problem occurs nowadays is overloaded of information from social media that is spread by people and confused the other people. Current function in Twitter allows people to ‘favorite’ tweets, perform re-tweet instantly, or added their own opinion on the tweet by quote and re-tweet. It is allowed the user to report tweets, sensitive or harmful tweets, and non-interested tweet, but there are no features to identify the credibility and accuracy of those tweets. Therefore, we proposed a technical solution where a prototype was developed in a Twitter-like environment by adding crowdsource rating features. The purpose of this research is to investigate the influence of crowd-sourced rating on tweets for decision making for the credibility of information spreading. A pilot study was conducted to a small real sample group of 31 respondents to know the respondent’s feedback on the prototype. The pilot study shows that most of the respondents were agree with the capabilities of crowdsourcing rating feature in identifying the accuracy and credibility of that information. The prototype design and the questionnaires have to be modified again, but the rating features was still the same. This prototype then redistributed to 139 respondents, and the respondents need to answer the control scenario part, prototype part, and the questionnaires. Control scenario design was similar like a prototype but without adding the crowdsource rating features. The questionnaires have divided into four parts, which is demographic information, social media usage, evaluation of the prototype, and evaluation on the usability of the prototype. Overall, the result from the questionnaires answer was a positive result where most of the respondents were agreed that crowdsourced rating feature was useful and helped them to identify and determine the accuracy and credibility of the information and help to prevent from spreading the misinformation in social media. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Crowdsourcing; Information overload; Information spreading; Social media; Twitter","Behavioral research; Decision making; Intelligent computing; Social networking (online); Surveys; Current function; Demographic information; Information overloads; Information spreading; Prototype designs; Social media; Technical solutions; Twitter; Crowdsourcing",,,,,,,,"Abdullah, N.A., Nishioka, D., Murayama, Y., Questionnaire testing: Identifying Twitter user’s information sharing behaviour during disaster (2016) J.

This study explores the underlying behavioral context of disaster information sharing by Twitter users. We conducted a web survey with 999 respondents in Japan to determine what makes people retweet disaster information in disaster situations. As a result of factor analysis, four factors were identified from 36 questions, namely: 1) Willingness to provide relevant and updated information because the information is believable, 2) Want people to know the information they perceive as important, 3) “Retweeter” subjective feelings and interests, and 4) Want to get feedback and alert other people. The results suggest that two of the factors influenced different groups of people in the community differently; however, everybody can play their role to reduce the negative impact of social media used for future disaster. Based on the findings, we discuss practical and design implications of social media use during disasters. © 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

After the Great East Japan Earthquake on 2011, Twitter was flooded with lots of disaster information, including misinformation that have been widely spread by retweet. Accordingly, we developed a questionnaire to investigate factors influenced people decision making to retweet disaster information they read from Twitter in disaster situations. We developed a questionnaire using brainstorming and KJ method and conducted a user survey (n = 57) to test the questionnaire items. Then, we analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and as a result, five factors derived from 38 question items which are: 1) Trustworthy information, 2) Relevance of the information during disasters, 3) Willingness to supply the information, 4) Importance of the information, and 5) Self Interest. However, there are 7 question items that need revision based on the results of the factor analysis. In this paper, we discuss the method we used to design the questionnaire and the result of the factor analyses of the questionnaire testing. © 2016 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Disaster; Information sharing; Questionnaire testing; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"White, C., Plotnick, L., Kushma, J., Hiltz, S.R., Turoff, M., Anonline social network for emergency management (2009) Int.

The Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11th, 2011 caused severe damage to the northern coast of the main island in Japan. We report our support activities in Iwate prefecture as well as our findings and experiences. We call disaster communications in this chapter. disaster communications. Following the requests from many organizations and groups of people, we started our support for the disaster area with a few of us in the department of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University ten days after the disaster. Through our support activities we came across an interesting issue concerning collaboration with people from heterogeneous backgrounds. Disagreements and distrust happened quite easily. We found that trust plays an important role in such communications. In our chapter, we introduce disaster communications as an area for research and practice as well as our trials on the recovery phase after the emergency response. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Despite the advantages offered by these services on supplying information in vague situation by citizen, we raised the issue of spreading misinformation on Twitter by using retweets. Accordingly, in this study, we conduct a user survey (n = 133) to investigate what is the user’s action towards spread message in Twitter, and why user decide to perform retweet on the spread message. As the result of the factor analyses, we extracted 3 factors on user’s action towards spread message which are: 1) Desire to spread the retweet messages as it is considered important, 2) Mark the retweet messages as favorite using Twitter “Favorite” function, and 3) Search for further information about the content of the retweet messages. Then, we further analyze why user decides to perform retweet. The results reveal that user has desire to spread the message which they think is important and the reason why they retweet it is because of the need to retweet, interesting tweet content and the tweet user. The results presented in this paper provide an understanding on user behavior of information diffusion, with the aim to reduce the spread of misinformation using Twitter during emergency situation. © 2015 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Decision making; Emergency; Misinformation; Retweet; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Peary, B.D.M., Shaw, R., Takeuchi, Y., Utilization of Social Media in the East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and its Effectiveness (2012) Journal of Natural Disaster Science, 34 (1), pp. 3-18; Turoff, M., Van De Walle, B., Hiltz, S.R., Emergency Response Information System Past, Present and Future (2010) Information Systems for Emergency Management, 16, pp. 369-387. , Van de Walle, B., Turoff, M., Hiltz, S.R.

In ambiguous situation where information is crucial, some misinformation may creep in and spread around by retweet. This paper discusses on Twitter issues in emergency situation. A survey was conducted to investigate user’s decision making after one read retweet messages in Twitter. As the result of the factor analyses, we grouped the 28 question items into three categories: 1) Desire to spread the retweet messages as it is considered important, 2) Mark the retweet messages as favorite using Twitter “Favorite” function, and 3) Search for further information about the content of the retweet messages. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.","Decision making; Emergency; Retweet; Social media; Twitter","Social networking (online); Emergency; Emergency situation; Real time; Retweet; Social media; Three categories; Twitter; Decision making",,,,,,,,"(2011) Survey on Social Media Use after the Great East Japan Earthquake, , http://mmd.up-date.ne.jp/news/detail.php?news_id=799, Mobile Marketing Data (MMD) Report, (in Japanese), (accessed December 14, 2013); White, C., Plotnick, L., Kushma, J., An online social network for emergency management (2009) Int.
