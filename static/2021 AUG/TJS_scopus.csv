However, the adversaries may also take advantage of the VPN services for other purposes. Thus, knowing the characteristics of the corresponding security protocols will benefit the administration to narrow down the targets. Also, given the various VPN services on the market, we also want to know whether there exists some security flaws from the cryptographic protocol's point of view, so that can be used to improve analyzing the protocol. In this paper, we first target several widely used open source secure proxy protocols and provide their weaknesses through the static analysis. Then we apply the deep learning technique to train all the related network traffic, and our results showed that all the secure proxy traffics can be successfully distinguished with high accuracy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Deep learning; Static analysis; Virtual private networks; Cryptographic protocols; High-accuracy; Learning techniques; Network traffic; Private communication; Proxy techniques; Security flaws; Security protocols; Network security,,,,,"203

These shares are digitally or physically overlapped to recover the original image, negating the need for complex mathematical operations or additional hardware. There have been many variations of visual cryptography proposed over the years, each addressing different problems or to fulfill different security requirements. Existing review papers on the area only cover certain types of visual cryptography or lack comparisons between the various schemes. To address this gap, this paper provides broad overview of the area to aid new researchers in identifying research problems or to select suitable visual cryptography methods for their desired applications. For more veteran researchers in the area, our paper provides the most up-to-date coverage of the state-of-the-art. We first provide an introduction to the various categories of visual cryptography techniques, including a discussion on recently proposed schemes. These schemes are then compared in terms of their features, performance metrics, advantages and disadvantages. Compared to prior work, we extend the number of comparison metrics to include signal-to-noise ratio and the type of shares. Over 40 visual cryptography schemes that have been proposed in the past two decades were analyzed and compared. Our findings indicate that existing problems such as pixel expansion, poor quality of recovered image quality, computational and memory complexities still exist, and a optimizing the trade-off between these requirements still requires further investigation. We conclude the paper with a discussion of these open problems and future research directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Confidentiality; Encryption; Information security; Pixel expansion; Secret sharing; Visual cryptography,Economic and social effects; Signal to noise ratio; Comparison metrics; Encryption technique; Future research directions; Mathematical operations; Performance metrics; Security requirements; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Cryptography,,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM: FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.",,"Jbraj, A., Sukumaran, C., Sm, R.G., (2019) Enhanced semantic visual secret sharing scheme for the secure image communication, 79 (23-24), pp. 17057-17079. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-7535-2; Abraham, A.S., Nair, L.R., Deepa, M.S., A novel method for evaluation of visual security of images (2017) : 2017 International Conference on Networks & Advances in Computational Technologies (Netact)., , IEEE; Al-Khalid, R.I., Al-Dallah, R.A., Al-Anani, A.M., Barham, R.M., Hajir, S.I., A secure visual cryptography scheme using private key with invariant share sizes (2017) J Softw Eng Appl, 10 (1), pp. 1-10; Alex, N.S., Anbarasi, L.J., Enhanced image secret sharing via error diffusion in halftone visual cryptography (2011) 2011 3Rd International Conference on Electronics Computer Technology, , IEEE; Amitharaja, R., Shaik, A., Thanikaise, V., Data security through data hiding in images: A review (2016) J Artif Intell, 10 (1), pp. 1-21; An extended visual cryptography scheme without pixel expansion for halftone images.

Data manipulation is a serious threat to data integrity which can occur in cloud computing - a relatively new offering under the umbrella of cloud services. Data can be tampered with, and malicious actors could use this to their advantage. Cloud computing clients in various application domains want to be assured that their data is accurate and trustworthy. On another spectrum, blockchain is a tamper-proof digital ledger that can be used alongside cloud technology to provide a tamper-proof cloud computing environment. This paper proposes a scheme that combines cloud computing with blockchain that assures data integrity for all homomorphic encryption schemes. To overcome the cloud service provider's (CSP) ultimate authority over the data, the proposed scheme relies on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus to build a distributed network of processing CSPs based on the client requirements. After certain computations performed by all CSPs, they produce a master hash value for their database. To ensure immutable data is produced, master hash values are preserved in Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain networks. The master hash values can be obtained by tracking the block header address for verification purposes. A theoretical analysis of the overhead costs associated with creating master hash values for each of the cryptocurrencies is presented. We found that Ethereum leads to lower client financial costs and better online performance than Bitcoin. We also specify the data security requirements the proposed scheme provides, the ground-level implementation, and future work. The proposed verification scheme is based on public cryptocurrency as a back-end service and does not require additional setup actions by the client other than a wallet for the chosen cryptocurrency. © 2013 IEEE.",Blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; homomorphic encryption,Bitcoin; Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Cost benefit analysis; Cryptography; Ethereum; Fault tolerance; Security of data; Web services; Byzantine fault tolerance; Cloud computing environments; Cloud service providers; Distributed networks; Homomorphic Encryption Schemes; Integrated architecture; On-line performance; Security requirements; Blockchain,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant LRGS/MRUN: 203.PKOMP.6777005.,,"Agarwal, V., Kaushal, A.K., Chouhan, L., A survey on cloud computing security issues and cryptographic techniques (2020) Social Networking and Computational Intelligence, pp. 119-134. , Singapore: Springer; https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/security-guidance-v4/, Cloud Security Alliance.

Watermarking techniques are used for many applications such as ownership protection, which is a popular area of research as compared to others such as authentication and local temper localization. There are many image watermarking schemes that have been recently published based on the frequency domain as it can fulfill watermarking requirements such as high robustness and imperceptibility. Singular-value decomposition (SVD) is one of them and is used in many frequency transform-based image watermarking schemes due to its stability and mathematical simplicity. However, there are many schemes that lack robustness against malicious cyberattacks, whereby the watermarks are easy to detect and destroy. Consequently, the proposed watermarking schemes became more complicated and cannot resist various geometric and non-geometric attacks. Thus, there are many existing hybrid SVD-based image watermarking schemes found be insecure. As there is also a lack of in-depth reviews in this domain, the focus of this paper is the analysis of the state-of-the-art in hybrid SVD-based image watermarking. We perform efficiency comparisons to highlight various security problems, open issues, and research gaps. Based on our findings, we additionally provide some recommendations for the development of more robust schemes in the future.

We investigate the effectiveness of both optimization algorithms alongside two classifiers, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). Performance evaluation of the four combinations, BDA-KNN, BDA-SVM, GOA-KNN and GOA-SVM, indicate near-ideal recognition rates, with the GOA variants slightly outperforming their BDA counterparts.

We address this problem by proposing a hash function based on a chaotic sponge construction and DNA sequence. DNA sequence is used to design state transition rules of a deterministic chaotic finite-state automata (DCFSA), a chaotic structure that enhances the chaoticity of digital chaotic maps. We use a DCFSA configuration consisting of four states associated with logistic maps. Analysis shows that the DCFSA configuration is efficient and has high chaotic complexity. Both DCFSA and DNA are used to design the sponge-based hash function. An input message is transformed into a DNA sequence and divided into fixed-length blocks. Each block is absorbed into a sponge structure via DNA-XOR. The sponge state is then updated with a new DNA sequence by iterating DCFSA as a compression function. Statistical evaluations indicate that the proposed hash function has near-ideal diffusion, confusion, collision resistance and distribution properties. The proposed hash can also extend the provably secure notions of the sponge construction, specifically the indifferentiability from random oracles. Furthermore, the hash function has a high level of performance as compared to other chaos-based hash functions. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaotic map DNA data integrity finite state automata hash function security,Chaotic systems; DNA sequences; Hash functions; Chaotic structure; Collision resistance; Compression functions; Distribution property; Indifferentiability; Provably secure; Sponge structures; Statistical evaluation; DNA,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: LRGS/MRUN:203,This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant LRGS/MRUN:203.PKOMP.6777005.,,"Alawida, M., Teh, J.S., Samsudin, A., Alshoura, W.H., An image encryption scheme based on hybridizing digital chaos and finite state machine (2019) Signal Process., 164, pp. 249-266. , Nov; Ismail, S.M., Said, L.A., Radwan, A.G., Madian, A.H., Abu-ElYazeed, M.F., A novel image encryption system merging fractional-order edge detection and generalized chaotic maps (2020) Signal Process., 167. , Feb; Jamal, S.S., Anees, A., Ahmad, M., Khan, M.F., Hussain, I., Construction of cryptographic S-boxes based on mobius transformation and chaotic tent-sine system (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 173273-173285; Razaq, A., Alolaiyan, H., Ahmad, M., Yousaf, M.A., Shuaib, U., Aslam, W., Alawida, M., A novel method for generation of strong substitutionboxes based on coset graphs and symmetric groups (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 75473-75490; Alshoura, W.H., Zainol, Z., Teh, J.S., Alawida, M., A new chaotic image watermarking scheme based on SVD and IWT (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 43391-43406; Alawida, M., Samsudin, A., Teh, J.S., Enhanced digital chaotic maps based on bit reversal with applications in random bit generators (2020) Inf.

Visual cryptography (VC) is commonly used for this purpose but leads to additional computational overhead and lower recognition accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a multifactor authentication (MFA) system based on facial recognition that uses VC to secure biometric data, and also as a second authentication factor. The shares generated by VC are used as authentication tokens. These tokens are verified by the same facial recognition algorithm used to recognize a live facial image of the user. This simple albeit novel approach leads to lower computational cost because the same algorithm can be used to verify both authentication factors. To maximize verification accuracy, the binary dragonfly optimization algorithm is used to maximize the quality of the recovered image from VC, as well as the accuracy of the facial recognition algorithm itself through feature selection. The combination of these separate ideas leads to a novel MFA system that is efficient and highly accurate. Experimental verification based on various face image databases depicts the proposed system’s security, efficiency, and near-ideal recognition accuracy of up to 99.81%. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Authentication; biometrics; facial recognition; multifactor authentication; visual Cryptography,Authentication; Cryptography; Authentication token; Computational costs; Computational overheads; Experimental verification; Multi-factor authentication; Optimization algorithms; Recognition accuracy; Visual cryptography; Face recognition,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.",,"Abhishek, K., Roshan, S., Kumar, P., Ranjan, R., A comprehensive study on multifactor authentication schemes (2013) Advances in Computing and Information Technology, pp. 561-568. , Meghanathan N., Nagamalai D., Chaki N.

Due to the lightweight nature of the IoT devices such as the RFID tags and so on, traditional encryption schemes such as AES which are relatively heavy in the sense of operations cannot be applied here. Lightweight block ciphers have since become a default standard when considering security protections on such lightweight IoT devices. Compared with the security analysis approaches by taking advantage of the differential or linear cryptanalysis, the security margin of lightweight block ciphers can be further derived more accurately due to the small internal state. In this paper, we investigate the security margin of the lightweight block cipher structure especially the SPN design by taking advantage of the parallel computing power of modern GPU architecture. We show how to accelerate the computing of the statistical distinguisher, which is the crucial point for analyzing the security of the cipher design. Our proposed methods gain notable advantage against traditional CPU architecture in terms of time complexity and possess extensibility for other block ciphers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Differential cryptanalysis; Graphics processing units; Parallel cryptanalysis; SPN cipher, Security margin",Graphics processing unit; Internet of things; Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Corresponding solutions; Encryption schemes; Lightweight block ciphers; Linear cryptanalysis; Parallel com- puting; Parallel processing; Security protection; Security solutions; Cryptography,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

The entropy source is the unpredictable sequence of thread access when parallel threads attempt to access the same memory location, known as race condition or data races. Although prior work using the same entropy source exists, they either have low efficiency or insufficient security analysis. The novelty of this work lies in its use of chaotic networks capable of extracting entropy while postprocessing outputs simultaneously. These networks are formulated by coupling chaotic maps in the form of chaotic coupled map lattices which have the capability to amplify minor uncertainties, leading to better performance as compared to other CPU-based TRNGs. We first perform experiments to depict the unpredictable nature of thread access due to race conditions through entropy and scale index analysis. Next, the proposed generator is scrutinized based on a standardized set of evaluation criteria which includes the use of multiple statistical test suites followed by an analysis of its non-deterministic property. We also perform an in-depth entropy analysis of the generator’s outputs and measure its degree of non-periodicity. Results indicate that the proposed chaos-based TRNG is fast, evenly distributed, and is secure enough for applications that have high security requirements. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",Chaotic map; Cryptography; Entropy; Multicore CPU; Parallel processing; Random number,,,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM: FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Project Number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.",,"Cherkaoui, A., Fischer, V., Aubert, A., Fesquet, L., A self-timed ring based true random number generator (2013) IEEE 19Th International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC), 2013, pp. 99-106. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2013.15; Walker, J., (2001) Hotbits: Genuine Random Numbers, Generated by Radioactive Decay., , www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits, www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits; Kanter, I., Aviad, Y., Reidler, I., Cohen, E., Rosenbluh, M., An optical ultrafast random bit generator (2009) Nat.

They produce unpredictable, non-repeatable random sequences. However, most TRNGs require specialized hardware to extract entropy from physical phenomena and tend to be slower than PRNGs. These generators usually require post-processing algorithms to eliminate biases but in turn, reduces performance. In this paper, a new post-processing method based on hyperchaos is proposed for software-based TRNGs which not only eliminates statistical biases but also provides amplification in order to improve the performance of TRNGs. The proposed method utilizes the inherent characteristics of chaos such as hypersensitivity to input changes, diffusion, and confusion capabilities to achieve these goals. Quantized bits of a physical entropy source are used to perturb the parameters of a hyperchaotic map, which is then iterated to produce a set of random output bits. To depict the feasibility of the proposed post-processing algorithm, it is applied in designing TRNGs based on digital audio. The generators are analyzed to identify statistical defects in addition to forward and backward security. Results indicate that the proposed generators are able to produce secure true random sequences at a high throughput, which in turn reflects on the effectiveness of the proposed post-processing method. © 2020, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",audio; chaos theory; chaotic map; entropy; hyperchaos; post-processing; random number generator; security,Entropy; Number theory; Processing; Forward and backward securities; Hyperchaotic maps; Inherent characteristics; Physical phenomena; Postprocessing algorithms; Postprocessing methods; Pseudo random number generators; Specialized hardware; Random number generation,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

As such, researchers have utilized them in the design of algorithms such as hash functions. Although there exist a wide range of chaos-based hash functions in literature, most of them are designed in an ad hoc manner rather than relying on well-established design paradigms. In addition, they are commonly implemented using floating-point operations which are inefficient as compared to their bitwise counterparts. The combination of convoluted designs and floating-point representation also leads to hash functions that are difficult to analyze; therefore, claims of security cannot be verified easily. These issues are some of the reasons why chaos-based hash functions have not seen widespread use in practice. This paper proposes a new unkeyed hash function based on a chaotic sponge construction and fixed-point arithmetic to overcome the aforementioned problems. The use of a sponge construction provides provable security justifications, whereas the use of fixed-point arithmetic allows chaotic map operations to be implemented using bitwise operations. The combination of these design elements leads to a design that is both efficient and facilitates future cryptanalysis for security verification. Security and performance evaluations indicate that the proposed hash function has near-ideal diffusion, confusion, collision resistance, and distribution properties in addition to a hashing speed that is at least on par with the current state of the art in chaos-based hash functions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Cryptography; Digital chaotic map; Fixed-point arithmetic; Hash function; Sponge construction; Tent map,Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Hash functions; Chaotic map; Cryptographic algorithms; Distribution property; Floating point operations; Security and performance; Security requirements; Tent map; Un-keyed hash functions; Fixed point arithmetic,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315190,This work has been partially supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6315190 and also the Malaysia Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant No. 203.PKOMP.6711801.,,"Abdoun, N., Assad, S.E., Deforges, O., Assaf, R., Khalil, M., Design and security analysis of two robust keyed hash functions based on chaotic neural networks (2019) J.

Despite the vast amount of contributions in the area, its applications in real-world scenarios are minimal as compared to conventional cryptography. Chaotic maps have been used in the design of cryptosystems because they depict desirable characteristics such as pseudorandomness, complexity, and sensitivity to parameter changes. Despite these characteristics being analogous to cryptographic requirements, the resulting chaos-based cryptosystems are usually difficult to analyze, inefficient, and have reproducibility issues. In this paper, we highlight some of the problems which deter the practical application of chaos-based cryptosystems. We show that recently published work in reputable journals still do not address these problems and remain only of academic interest. We also perform experiments to depict some of the implementation issues of digital chaos that need to be taken into consideration when designing chaos-based algorithms. We then discuss a number of possible solutions that can be explored to overcome these problems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Authentication; Chaos theory; Cryptanalysis; Cryptography; Image encryption; Security,Authentication; Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Chaos-based cryptography; Cryptanalysis; Image encryptions; Practical problems; Real-world scenario; Reproducibilities; Security; Sensitivity to parameters; Cryptography,,,,,"203

Thus, enhancing digital chaotic maps in terms of their chaoticity and statistical properties contributes towards the improvement of chaos-based cryptography. This paper proposes a bit reversal approach to address these issues. The proposed method modifies chaotic state values (represented as fixed point numbers) by reversing the order of their fractional bits. Experimental verification indicates that chaotic maps modified by the proposed approach depict better chaotic performance, have higher complexity and larger chaotic parameter range. These results exceed those of existing digital chaotic maps and other chaotification methods. The simplicity of the proposed bit reversal approach and the use of fixed point representation makes it easy to implement on any computing platform. This approach is also highly flexible as it does not require any external inputs, making it a universal method for enhancing any digital chaotic map. As a proof-of-concept, a pseudorandom bit generator (PRBG) was designed based on cascading chaotic maps modified by the proposed method. Simulation and security analysis indicate that the proposed PRBG is statistically random, has a uniform data distribution and high key sensitivity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Chaotification; Digital chaotic map; Fixed point arithmetic; Henon map; Logistic map; Pseudorandom bit generator,Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Fixed platforms; Lyapunov methods; Number theory; Chaotic map; Chaotification; Henon map; Logistic maps; Pseudorandom bit generator; Fixed point arithmetic,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6316280,This work has been supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6316280 .,,"Addabbo, T., Alioto, M., Fort, A., Pasini, A., Rocchi, S., Vignoli, V., A class of maximum-period nonlinear congruential generators derived from the rényi chaotic map (2007) IEEE Trans.

Each individual share cannot reveal clues about the secret image. Existing visual cryptography schemes suffer from problems such as pixel expansion, high computational complexity and poor decryption quality. To overcome these problems, we propose a new 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme for color images based on the binary dragonfly algorithm. The dragonfly algorithm is used to determine optimal color levels for the encryption process, which leads to reconstructed images with the higher quality upon decryption with minimal effect on the overall computational complexity. The proposed scheme is also non-expansible, whereby the share images are of the same size as the original secret image. This leads to reduced memory requirements as well as improved image quality. We analyze the strength of the proposed scheme based on a standard set of metrics which includes an evaluation of its resistance against cryptanalytic attacks, histogram, correlation, entropy and encryption quality. Results show that the proposed visual cryptography scheme has desired properties such as improved recovered image quality, near-ideal statistical characteristics and fast encryption speed, depicting an improvement over existing schemes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Dragonfly algorithm; encryption; optimization algorithm; secret sharing; security; visual cryptography,Color; Computational complexity; Image enhancement; Image quality; Cryptanalytic attacks; Encryption technique; Reconstructed image; Reduced memory requirements; Secret sharing schemes; Statistical characteristics; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Cryptography,,,,,FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1,"This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.",,"Ferdush, J., Mondol, G., Prapti, A.P., An enhanced image encryption technique combining genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization with chaotic function (2019) Int J Comput Appl, pp. 1-8. , et al; Ambika, Biradar, R.L., Burkpalli, V., Encryption-based steganography of images by multiobjective whale optimal pixel selection (2019) Int J Comput Appl, pp. 1-10; Naor, M., Shamir, A., Visual cryptography.

This paper introduces an alternative approach in applying machine learning to block cipher cryptanalysis. Rather than trying to extract secret keys, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict a cipher's security margin with respect to the number of active s-boxes. Prediction is based on cipher features such as the number of rounds, permutation pattern, and truncated differences. Experiments are performed on a simplified generalised Feistel structure (GFS) block cipher. Prediction accuracy is optimised by refining how cipher features are represented as training data, and tuning hyperparameters. Results show that the machine learning classifiers are able formulate a relationship between the cipher features and security. When used to predict an unseen cipher (a cipher whose data was not used for training), an accuracy of up to 62% was obtained, depicting the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 ACM.",Active s-box; Block cipher; Differential cryptanalysis; Linear classifier; Machine learning; Security,Forecasting; Machine learning; Security of data; Turing machines; Block ciphers; Feistel structures; Hyperparameters; Machine learning approaches; Permutation patterns; Prediction accuracy; Security margins; Training data; Cryptography,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1 and by the Uniten BOLD research grant under Grant No. 10463494/B/2019117.",,"Alallayah, K., Amin, M., AbdElwahed, W., Alhamamii, A., Applying neural networks for simplified data encryption standard (SDES) cipher system cryptanalysis (2012) The International Arab Journal of Information Technology, pp. 163-169. , Zarqa University, Jordan; Alani, M.M., Neuro-cryptanalysis of DES and triple-DES (2012) Neural Information Processing, pp. 637-646. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Albassal, A., Wahdan, A.-M., Neural network based cryptanalysis of a feistel type block cipher (2004) International Conference on Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, 2004.

The proposed approach substantially increases the performance of the differential cluster search. We were able to derive a branch enumeration and evaluation kernel that is 5.95 times faster than its CPU counterpart. To showcase its practicality, the proposed algorithm is applied on TRIFLE-BC, a 128-bit block cipher. By incorporating a meet-in-the-middle approach with the proposed GPU kernel, we were able to improve the search efficiency (on 20 rounds of TRIFLE-BC) by approximately 58 times as compared to the CPU-based approach. Differentials consisting of up to 50 million individual characteristics can be constructed for 20 rounds of TRIFLE, leading to slight improvements to the overall differential probabilities. Even for larger rounds (43 rounds), the proposed algorithm is still able to construct large clusters of over 500 thousand characteristics. This result depicts the practicality of the proposed algorithm in constructing large differentials even for a 128-bit block cipher, which could be used to improve cryptanalytic findings against other block ciphers in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Automated search; Block cipher; Branch-and-bound; Cryptanalysis; Differential characteristic; Differential cluster; GPU,Branch and bound method; Cryptography; Graphics processing unit; Security of data; Automated searches; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Differential probabilities; GPU-accelerated; Individual characteristics; Large clusters; Meet-in-the-middle; Search efficiency; Clustering algorithms,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

Out of its various configurations, we select the forward and parameter permutation variant, $DCFSA_{FWP}$ due to its desirable chaotic properties. These properties are analogous to hash function requirements such as diffusion, confusion and collision resistance. The proposed hash function consists of six machine states and three simple chaotic maps. This particular structure of DCFSA can process larger message blocks (leading to higher hashing rates) and optimizes its randomness. The proposed hash function is analyzed in terms of various security aspects and compared with other recently proposed chaos-based hash functions to demonstrate its efficiency and reliability. Results indicate that the proposed hash function has desirable statistical characteristics, elevated randomness, optimal diffusion and confusion properties as well as flexibility. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaotic map; cryptography; data integrity; finite state automata; hash function; security,Automata theory; Chaotic systems; Lyapunov methods; Random processes; Chaotic properties; Collision resistance; Deterministic finite state automata; Function requirements; Its efficiencies; Machine state; Security aspects; Statistical characteristics; Hash functions,,,,,FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1,This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Project FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.,,"Perin, L.P., Zambonin, G., Martins, D.M.B., Custodio, R., Martina, J.E., Tuning the Winternitz hash-based digital signature scheme (2018) Proc.

However, the false positive problem (FPP) is the main drawback of SVD-based watermarking schemes. The singular value is the main cause of FPP issues because it a fixed value that does not hold structural information of an image. In this paper, a new SVD-based image watermarking scheme that uses a chaotic map is proposed to overcome this issue. The secret key is first extracted from both the host and watermark image. This key is used to generate a new chaotic matrix and chaotic multiple scaling factors (CMSF) to increase the sensitivity of the proposed scheme. The watermark image is then transformed based on the chaotic matrix before being directly embedded into the singular value of the host image by using the CMSF. The extracted secret key is unique to the host and the watermark images, which improves security and overcomes FPP issues. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme fulfils all watermarking requirements in terms of robustness, imperceptibility, security, and payload. Furthermore, it achieves high robustness with different scaling factors, and outperforms several existing schemes. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaotic map; Image watermark; Integer wavelet transform; IWT; Singular value decomposition; SVD,Chaotic systems; Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Chaotic map; High robustness; Integer wavelet transforms; Scaling factors; Singular values; Structural information; Watermark images; Watermarking schemes; Image watermarking,,,,,FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1,This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Project FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.,,"Kumar, C., Singh, A.K., Kumar, P., A recent survey on image water-marking techniques and its application in e-governance (2017) Multimedia Tools Appl., 77 (3), pp. 3597-3622. , Sep; Pan, J.-S., Huang, H.-C., Jain, L.C., (2004) Intelligent Watermarking Tech-niques, 7. , Singapore: World Scientific; Huang, H.-C., (2009) Information Hiding Application, 227. , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Bal, S.N., Nayak, M.R., Sarkar, S.K., On the implementation of a secured watermarking mechanism based on cryptography and bit pairs matching J.

Enhancing chaotic complexity of simple one-dimensional (1D) chaotic maps has been a popular topic of research in recent years. However, most of the proposed methods have low complexity and are not suitable for practical applications. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a novel approach known as deterministic chaotic finite-state automata (DCFSA). Existing 1D chaotic maps are associated with deterministic finite automata states. Then, a transition rule dynamically selects which 1D chaotic map to compute. DCFSA allows the creation of a large number of possible chaotic configurations with enhanced nonlinearity while retaining the computational complexity comparable to a 1D map. Theoretical and performance analyses show that DCFSA provides a larger chaotic parameter range, higher nonlinearity and chaotic complexity, as well as longer cycle length as compared to its underlying 1D chaotic maps. Moreover, performance comparison against other existing chaotification methods demonstrates DCFSA’s superiority. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Deterministic finite-state automata (DFSA); Digital chaotic map; Logistic map; Sine map; Tent map,Lyapunov methods; One dimensional; Chaotic map; Chaotic parameter range; Deterministic finite automata; Deterministic finite state automata; Logistic maps; Optimization algorithms; Performance comparison; Tent map; Chaotic systems,,,,,"203

Chaotic systems are used to design image ciphers due to properties such as ergodicity and initial condition sensitivity. A chaos-based cipher derives its security strength from its underlying digital chaotic map, thus a more complex map leads to higher security. This paper introduces an enhancement to a tent map's chaotic properties by hybridizing it with a deterministic finite state machine. We denote the resulting digital one-dimensional chaotic system as TM-DFSM. Chaotic analyses indicate that the new chaotic system has higher nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial condition, and larger chaotic parameter range than other recently proposed one-dimensional chaotic systems. We then propose a new image encryption scheme based on TM-DFSM, capable of performing both confusion and diffusion operations in one pass while also having a flexible key space. The encryption operations are designed to achieve maximal confusion and diffusion properties. Changing a single bit of the plainimage or secret key will result in an entirely different cipherimage. The proposed cipher has been analyzed using histogram analysis, contrast analysis, local Shannon entropy, resistance against differential cryptanalysis, and key security. Performance comparison with other recent schemes also depicts the proposed cipher's superiority. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Chaos theory; Cryptography; Deterministic finite state machine; Fixed-point number; Image encryption; Tent map,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Functions; Image processing; Chaotic parameter range; Deterministic finite state machines; Differential cryptanalysis; Fixed-point numbers; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Tent map; Cryptography,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6316280,This work has been supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6316280 .,,"Teh, J.S., Tan, K., Alawida, M., A chaos-based keyed hash function based on fixed point representation (2018) Cluster Comput., pp. 1-12; Hua, Z., Jin, F., Xu, B., Huang, H., 2D logistic-sine-coupling map for image encryption (2018) Signal Process., 149, pp. 148-161; Zhongyun Hua, Y.Z., Yi, S., Medical image encryption using high-speed scrambling and pixel adaptive diffusion (2018) Signal Process., 149, pp. 148-161; Wang, Y., Wong, K.-W., Liao, X., Chen, G., A new chaos-based fast image encryption algorithm.

Digital chaos is one of the areas used to design image ciphers due to its many desirable properties such as ergodicity, initial state sensitivity and unpredictability. This paper proposes a new image cipher based on the perturbation of a new hybrid chaotic system. The proposed hybrid system cascades and combines two chaotic maps as part of a new chaotification method. Chaotic performance evaluation indicates that the new hybridization method has better complexity, higher sensitivity, and a larger chaotic parameter range as compared to other recently proposed chaotification methods. The new chaotic system is then used in the design of a new image cipher. Both confusion and diffusion properties are attained based on perturbing the chaotic states and system parameters, which are then involved in pixel shuffling and substitution operations respectively. Security and performance analysis indicates that the proposed scheme is highly resistant to various cryptanalytic attacks, is statistically superior and more secure than previously proposed chaos-based image ciphers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Chaos theory; Chaotic map; Cryptography; Image cipher; Image encryption; Perturbation,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Hybrid systems; Image processing; White noise; Chaotic map; Chaotic parameter range; Cryptanalytic attacks; Hybridization methods; Image cipher; Image encryptions; Perturbation; Security and performance; Cryptography,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

However, they are slower than their pseudorandom counterparts because they need to extract entropy from physical phenomenon. To overcome this drawback, generators have been designed to extract unpredictability from devices such as computer processing units or microphones. This paper introduces a new generator for the Android mobile platform based on images captured by a built-in camera. Although similar generators exist, they suffer from poor performance and a lack of proper security evaluation. The proposed generator implements a chaos-based postprocessing algorithm that eliminates statistical defects and increases its throughput. These goals are achieved by using the inherent properties of a chaotic system to amplify entropy extracted from the captured images. The proposed generator is evaluated in two phases: first, statistical test suites are executed to identify statistical defects. Next, the generator’s forward and backward security is analysed. Results indicate that the proposed true random number generator is able to generate statistically secure true random number sequences faster than existing mobile-based generators. In addition, the generator is designed to support parallel processing, thus allowing its performance to scale according to the mobile device’s multicore architecture. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Android; Chaos theory; Digital camera; Mobile device; True random number generator,Android (operating system); Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Computer architecture; Defects; Digital cameras; Entropy; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Number theory; Software architecture; Android; Computer processing; Forward and backward securities; Multicore architectures; Parallel processing; Postprocessing algorithms; Security evaluation; True randoms; Random number generation,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

However, these maps are commonly implemented using floating point representation which has high computational complexity. They also suffer from interoperability problems and are not easy to analyse from the binary point of view. These drawbacks lead to a lack of acceptance of chaos-based cryptography for practical use. This paper overcomes these problems by introducing a chaos-based hash function implemented using fixed point representation which computes digital chaotic maps using integers. Its design is based on the Merkle–Damgård construction and the generalised Feistel structure for strong security justifications. Security evaluation indicates that the proposed hash function has near-perfect statistical properties which include diffusion, confusion, collision resistance and distribution. The proposed hash function also surpasses existing chaos-based hash functions in terms of performance, making it a viable hash function for practical implementation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Chaotic iterations; Chaotic map; Cryptography; Fixed point arithmetic; Hash function; Security evaluation,Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Function evaluation; Hash functions; Lyapunov methods; Chaos-based cryptography; Chaotic iteration; Chaotic map; Collision resistance; Feistel structures; Keyed hash functions; Security evaluation; Statistical properties; Fixed point arithmetic,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

This paper introduces a hybrid chaotic system that enhances the dynamical behaviour of these maps to overcome this problem. The proposed system uses cascade and combination methods as a nonlinear chaotification function. To depict the capability of the proposed system, we apply it to classical chaotic maps and analyse them using theoretical analysis, conventional, fractal and randomness evaluations. Results show that the enhanced maps have a larger chaotic range, low correlation, uniform data distribution and better chaotic properties. As a proof of concept, simple pseudorandom number generators are then designed based on a classical map and its enhanced variant. Security comparisons between the two generators indicate that the generator based on the enhanced map has better statistical properties as compared to its classical counterpart. This finding showcases the capability of the proposed system in improving the performance of chaos-based algorithms. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Chaotic map; Dynamical degradation; Logistic map; Pseudorandom number generator; Sine map; Unimodal map,Cryptography; Lyapunov methods; Number theory; Random number generation; Chaotic map; Chaotic properties; Classical counterpart; Dynamical behaviours; Logistic maps; Pseudo random number generators; Statistical properties; Unimodal map; Chaotic systems,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

Despite their ease of use, user authentication is an important factor that must be taken into consideration. In addition to the use of passwords, biometric data such as fingerprints or iris images can also be included as part of a multi-factor authentication system. However, these methods require secure storage of the biometric template and active participation from the user. In this paper, we propose a new method of authentication for identification cards based on colour visual cryptography and facial recognition. A colour image of the user will be encrypted using visual cryptography and split into two share images, one of which will be stored on the database and the other will be stored in the card. When the card is placed onto a sensor, the two shares will overlap to uncover the original image. The recovered image is then fed into a trained facial recognition algorithm to verify the user’s identity. The proposed method is evaluated based on recognition rate and runtime. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of the proposed method for practical application and can be used as a starting point for future work in the area. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Biometric template protection; Color visual cryptography; Facial recognition; Two-factor authentication methods; Visual cryptography,Authentication; Biometrics; Chromium compounds; Color; Cryptography; Digital storage; Electronic commerce; Biometric template protections; Electronic passports; Facial recognition; Identification cards; Multi-factor authentication; Public transportation; Two factor authentication; Visual cryptography; Face recognition,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

This paper proposes a new chaotification method that enhances the chaotic complexity of existing chaotic maps to surmount these issues. The proposed method uses a cosine function alongside a chaotic map in a cascade system. To depict its advantages, we apply it to enhance logistic and Henon maps before analyzing their chaotic properties. Results and comparisons indicate that the new chaotic maps have a wider chaotic range, elevated sensitivity, complex characteristics, high nonlinearity, and an extended cycle length as compared to the original (seed) maps as well as other chaotic maps. We then utilize the modified maps (and their corresponding seed maps) to design simple pseudorandom number generators to study their feasibility when used in cryptographic algorithms. We perform comparisons between the generators derived from both the original and seed maps. Results show that generators based on the new maps outperform their seed counterparts in nearly every aspect. This finding demonstrates the capability of the proposed method in improving the performance of chaos-based cryptographic algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaos theory; Cosine function; cryptography; Henon map; logistic map; Pseudo random number generator,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Cosine transforms; Cryptography; Functions; Lyapunov methods; Number theory; Chaotic properties; Complex characteristics; Cosine functions; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic applications; Henon map; Logistic maps; Pseudo random number generators; Random number generation,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6316280,This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant 304/PKOMP/6316280 and in part by the Malaysia Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant 203.PKOMP.6711801.,,"Ivancevic, V.G., Ivancevic, T.T., (2008) Complex Nonlinearity: Chaos, Phase Transitions, Topology Change and Path Integrals, , Springer; Teh, J.S., Tan, K., Alawida, M., A chaos-based keyed hash function based on fixed point representation (2019) Cluster Comput, 22 (2), pp. 649-660; Alzaidi, A.A., Ahmad, M., Doja, M.N., Al Solami, E., Beg, M.M.S., A new 1D chaotic map and -hill climbing for generating substitutionboxes (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 55405-55418; Al Solami, E., Ahmad, M., Volos, C., Doja, M., Beg, M., A new hyperchaotic system-based design for efficient bijective substitution-boxes (2018) Entropy, 20 (7), p. 525; Hassan, M.F., Hammuda, M., A new approach for constrained chaos synchronization with application to secure data communication (2019) J.

The internet provides an unsecured channel in which hundreds of terabytes of data is being transmitted daily. Computer and software systems rely on encryption algorithms such as block ciphers to ensure that sensitive data remains confidential and secure. However, adversaries can leverage the statistical behavior of underlying ciphers to recover encryption keys. Accurate evaluation of the security margins of these encryption algorithms remains to be a big challenge. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing several searching strategies based on differential cryptanalysis. By clustering differential paths, the searching algorithm derives more accurate distinguishers as compared to examining individual paths, which in turn provides a more accurate estimation of cipher security margins. We verify the effectiveness of this technique on ciphers with the generalized Feistel and SPN structures, whereby the best distinguishers for each of the investigated ciphers were obtained by discovering clusters with thousands of paths. With the KATAN block cipher family as a test case, we also show how to apply the searching algorithm alongside other cryptanalysis techniques such as the boomerang attack and related-key model to obtain the best cryptanalytic results. This also depicts the flexibility of the proposed searching scheme, which can be tailored to improve upon other differential attack variants. In short, the proposed searching strategy realizes an automated security evaluation tool with higher accuracy compared to previous techniques. In addition, it is applicable to a wide range of encryption schemes which makes it a flexible tool for both academic research and industrial purposes. © 1968-2012 IEEE.",Accurate security margin; active s-box; branch and bound algorithm; differential path searching; KATAN; LBlock; PRESENT; TWINE,Branch and bound method; Clustering algorithms; Industrial research; Lyapunov methods; Network security; Security of data; Twine; active s-box; Branch-and-bound algorithms; differential path searching; KATAN; LBlock; PRESENT; Security margins; Cryptography,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 15K16005",,,"Chen, J., Teh, J.S., Su, C., Samsudin, A., Fang, J., Improved (related-key) attacks on round-reduced KATAN-32/48/64 based on the extended boomerang framework (2016) Proc.

It also synchronizes communication between two parties. However, there are many cryptanalytic attacks that exploit weaknesses in the IV setup of stream ciphers. In an effort to solve this problem, we introduce a chaos-based stream cipher that utilizes a new mode of synchronization called true random synchronization (TRSync). The stream cipher is designed based on spatiotemporal chaos while taking advantage of TRSync to resist various statistical attacks. The stream cipher operations also include data-dependent rotations and chaotic perturbation. As chaotic functions are inherently slow due to floating point operations, we utilize fixed point representation for higher efficiency. TRSync includes a true random number sequence (TRNS) into the synchronization process alongside the public IV. The IV is masked by the TRNS before being used to setup the cipher. Therefore, the cipher's internal state cannot be manipulated by an attacker and constantly changes even if the secret key-IV pairs are constant. TRSync can also be used to secure other stream ciphers with IVs as described in this paper. The security of the proposed chaotic cipher is thoroughly analyzed in terms of randomness, periodicity, entropy, balance, correlation, and complexity. © 2017 IETE.",Chaos; Cryptography; Encryption; Initialization vector; Stream cipher; Tent map,Chaos theory; Digital arithmetic; Synchronization; Cryptanalytic attacks; Data-dependent rotations; Floating point operations; Initialization vectors; Spatiotemporal chaos; Stream Ciphers; Synchronization process; Tent map; Cryptography,,,,,,,,"Ekdahl, P., Johansson, T., A new version of the stream cipher SNOW (2003) Proc. of Selected Areas in Cryptogr.

AEAD schemes provide authentication for a message that is divided into two parts: associated data which is not encrypted and the plaintext which is encrypted. However, there is a lack of chaos-based AEAD schemes in recent literature. This paper introduces a new 128-bit chaos-based AEAD scheme based on the single-key Even-Mansour and Type-II generalized Feistel structure. The proposed scheme provides both privacy and authentication in a single-pass using only one 128-bit secret key. The chaotic tent map is used to generate whitening keys for the Even-Mansour construction, round keys, and random s-boxes for the Feistel round function. In addition, the proposed AEAD scheme can be implemented with true random number generators to map a message to multiple possible ciphertexts in a nondeterministic manner. Security and statistical evaluation indicate that the proposed scheme is highly secure for both the ciphertext and the authentication tag. Furthermore, it has multiple advantages over AES-GCM which is the current standard for authenticated encryption. © 2017 J. S. Teh and A.

Unlike their pseudorandom counterparts, TRNGs are more computationally expensive as they need to harvest entropy from physical phenomena. To generate high quality true random numbers at a fast rate, this paper introduces a new TRNG based on hyperchaos and digital sound. The characteristics of a hyperchaotic map such as sensitivity to initial conditions and complex behavior amplifies noise obtained by sampling environmental sound through a computer microphone. The random numbers generated are then evaluated using statistical test suites such as NIST SP 800-22, DIEHARD and ENT. Because nondeterminism cannot be proved by merely running test suites, entropy analysis is performed to determine the unpredictability of these sequences. Results show that the proposed TRNG can generate true random numbers at a high rate while maintaining strong statistical quality. In addition, the entropy source requires only an inexpensive computer microphone which is already built into many laptops and handheld devices. Therefore, the proposed generator provides a low-cost and easily obtainable option for applications that require true random numbers. © 2016 IEEE.",Audio sample; Chaotic map; Entropy; Security verification; True random number generator,Chaotic systems; Entropy; Information science; Microphones; Number theory; Programmable logic controllers; Audio samples; Chaotic map; Environmental sounds; Physical phenomena; Security verification; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Statistical quality; True randoms; Random number generation,,,,,,,,"Walker, J., (2001) Hotbits: Genuine Random Numbers, Generated by Radioactive Decay, , www.formilab.ch/hotbits; Crȩt, O., Gyořfi, T., Suciu, A., Implementing true random number generators based on high fanout nets (2012) Romanian Journal of Information Science and Technology, 15 (3), pp. 277-298; Jun, B., Kocher, P., (1999) The Intel Random Number Generator; Teh, J.S., Samsudin, A., Al-Mazrooie, M., Akhavan, A., GPUs and chaos: A new true random number generator (2015) Nonlinear Dynamics, 82 (4), pp. 1913-1922. , July; Davis, D., Ihaka, R., Fenstermacher, P., Cryptographic randomness from air turbulence in disk drives (2001) Proc.

For large number of rounds, it is not a trivial task to find such differential or linear paths. Matsui first investigated this problem and proposed a solution based on a branch and bound algorithm in 1994. Since then, the research on finding good concrete differential or linear path did not receive much attention. In this paper, we revisit the differential attack against several S-Box based block ciphers by carefully studying the differential characteristics. Inspired by Matsui's algorithm, we provide an improved solution with the aid of several searching strategies, which enable us to find by far the best differential characteristics for the two investigated ciphers (LBlock, TWINE) efficiently. Furthermore, we provide another way to evaluate the security of ciphers against differential attack by comparing the strength of the ciphers from differential characteristic's point of view, and we also investigate the accuracy when using the active S-Box to evaluate the security margin against differential attack, which is the common method adapted when new ciphers are designed. © 2015 IEEE.",Active S-box; Branch and Bound algorithm; Differential Path; LBlock; TWINE,Algorithms; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Lyapunov methods; Probability distributions; Security of data; Twine; Active S-box; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Differential attacks; Differential characteristic; Differential Path; LBlock; Linear cryptanalysis; Uniform random distributions; Branch and bound method,,,,,,,,"Matsui, M., On correlation between the order of s-boxes and the strength of des (1995) Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT'94, Ser.

It has been widely applied to successfully attack many existing ciphers. In this paper, we investigate an extended version of the boomerang attack and show that it is still a very powerful tool especially in the related-key setting. A new branch-and-bound searching strategy which involves the extended boomerang framework is then introduced. We provide an improved cryptanalysis on the KATAN family (a family of hardware-oriented block ciphers proposed in CHES 2009) based on the boomerang attack. In the related-key setting, we were able to greatly improve upon the previous results to achieve the best results, namely 150 and 133 rounds by far for KATAN48/64 respectively. For KATAN32 in the related-key setting and all KATAN variants in the single-key setting, our results are the best ones in the differential setting although inferior to the meet-in-the-middle attack. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Boomerang attack; Differential attack; KATAN32/48/64; Related-key attack,Cryptography; Boomerang attack; Differential attacks; Differential setting; Extended versions; KATAN32/48/64; Meet-in-the-middle attacks; Related key attacks; Searching strategy; Security of data,,,,,"203/PKOMP/6711427

One of these attacks, the differential attack has been demonstrated to break a wide range of block ciphers. Block cipher proposals previously obtain a rough estimate of their security margin against differential attacks by counting the number of active S-Box along a differential path. However this method does not take into account the complex clustering effect of multiple differential paths. Analysis under full differential distributions have been studied for some extremely lightweight block ciphers such as KATAN and SIMON, but is still unknown for ciphers with relatively large block sizes. In this paper, we provide a framework to accurately estimate the full differential distribution of General Feistel Structure (GFS) block ciphers with relatively large block sizes. This framework acts as a convenient tool for block cipher designers to determine the security margin of their ciphers against differential attacks. We describe our theoretical model and demonstrate its correctness by performing experimental verification on a toy GFS cipher. We then apply our framework to two concrete GFS ciphers, LBlock and TWINE to derive their full differential distribution by using super computer. Based on the results, we are able to attack 25 rounds of TWINE-128 using a distinguishing attack, which is comparable to the best attack to date. Besides that, we are able to depict a correlation between the hamming weight of an input differential characteristic and the complexity of the attack. Based on the proposed framework, LBlock and TWINE have shown to have 178 and 208-bit security respectively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Differential attack; Differential distribution; GFS; LBlock; TWINE,Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Twine; Cryptographic primitives; Differential attacks; Differential characteristic; Differential distribution; Distinguishing attacks; Experimental verification; LBlock; Lightweight block ciphers; Cryptography,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: 15K16005

Most TRNGs obtain randomness from physical phenomena such as radio noise, radioactive decay or thermal noise that are unpredictable. These applications usually require external hardware to extract entropy and convert them into digital signals. This paper introduces a TRNGs that utilizes graphics processing units as the source of entropy. Its unpredictable behavior is harnessed by computing chaotic maps that are highly sensitive to slight changes to their control parameters and have pseudo-random behavior. A simple post-processing function based on modular addition and XOR is then used to achieve an unbiased output. The security of the proposed TRNG is evaluated using statistical test suites such as the NIST SP 800-22, DIEHARD and ENT, as well as entropy analysis to determine unpredictability. Results indicate that the proposed TRNG has strong statistical quality of random numbers and high throughput without the need of external specialized equipment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Chaotic map; CUDA; GPU; Security evaluation; True random number generator,Balloons; Chaotic systems; Computer graphics; Entropy; Number theory; Program processors; Radio astronomy; Radioactivity; Chaotic map; CUDA; GPU; Security evaluation; True randoms; Random number generation,,,,,"203/PKOMP/6711427

However, many existing chaos-based algorithms are slow due to floating point operations. They are mostly sequential in nature and therefore cannot take advantage of multicore processors for faster speed. In this paper, a new chaos-based hash function is proposed that utilizes multiple instances of chaotic maps that run in parallel to improve hashing speed. Parallelization is realized using the baseline network that also strengthens the security of the hash function due to its shuffling mechanism. The combination of linear and nonlinear chaotic maps is used to provide a high level of sensitivity to initial conditions, confusion and diffusion characteristics as well as strong collision resistance. Results show that the proposed design has strong security strength with near-perfect statistical qualities and fast hashing speed that surpasses both chaotic hash functions and the MD5 hash function. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Hash function; Message authentication; Multi-stage interconnection; Piecewise nonlinear chaotic map; Tent map,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Digital arithmetic; Lyapunov methods; Mobile security; Diffusion characteristics; Floating point operations; Message authentication; Multi stage; Piecewise nonlinear chaotic maps; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Shuffle exchange networks; Tent map; Hash functions,,,,,"203/PKOMP/6711427
