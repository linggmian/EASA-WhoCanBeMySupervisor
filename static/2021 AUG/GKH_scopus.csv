Ontology is one of the major cornerstones of representing the information in a more meaningful way on the semantic Web. The current ontology repositories are quite limited either for their scope or for currentness. In addition, the current ontology extraction systems have many shortcomings and drawbacks, such as using a small dataset, depending on a large amount predefined patterns to extract semantic relations, and extracting a very few types of relations. The aim of this paper is to introduce a proposal of automatically extracting semantic concepts and relations from scientific publications. This paper introduces a novel relevance measurement for concepts, and it suggests new types of semantic relations. Also, it points out of using deep learning (DL) models for semantic relation extraction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Concept extraction; Deep learning; Ontology construction; Relevance measurements; Semantic relation discovery","Extraction; Large dataset; Ontology; Ontology Extraction; Ontology repositories; Scientific publications; Semantic concept; Semantic relation extractions; Semantic relations; Types of relations; Unstructured data; Deep learning",,,,,,,,"Mishra, S., Jain, S., A study of various approaches and tools on ontology (2015) IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), pp. 57-61. , , pp. , 2015; Maimon, O., Browarnik, A., Ontology learning from text: Why the ontology learning layer cake is not viable (2015) Int.

Review sentences contain sentiment words that show whether a user’s opinion is positive or negative. When review sentence has mix opinions, having sentiment words of both polarities, it is difficult to conclude whether it is positive or negative opinion. The purpose of this study is to improve the detection of polarity in such situation. Design methodology approach: In this research, methods such as part-of-speech tagging, polarity analysis and rules selection are used to identify the polarity. A set of rules called contrast and conditional polarity rules (CCPR) has been created to improve the polarity detection in cases when there is mixture of sentiment words used in contrast and conditional type of review sentences. The experiment is conducted with data sets from three domains, i.e. restaurant, electronic and Tripadvisor. Findings: The experimental result confirms that CCPR rules have higher baseline of the polarity aggression. In restaurant domain, CCPR rules (62.07%) have increased 13.79% compared with the Pol_Agg_MPQA baseline (48.28%) and 13.79% compared with Pol_Agg_Senti baseline (48.28%). In electronic domain, CCPR rule (79.17%) is higher by 12.50% compared with the Pol_Agg_MPQA baseline (66.67%) and 16.67% compared with Pol_Agg_Senti baseline (62.50%). Another one, CCPR rule (70.83%) is higher by 8.33% compared with the Pol_Agg_MPQA baseline (62.50%) and 12.50% compared with Pol_Agg_Senti baseline (58.33%). In conclusion, result of experiment shows promising outcome with improvement in detecting the positivity and negativity of indirect sentence, especially for the case of sentence with indirect polarity. Originality value: To address the problem of mix opinions in terms of polarities, this paper presents a rule-based approach to improve the result of identifying positivity and negativity in sentence with indirect polarities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Opinion mining; Polarity detection; Rule-based approach; Sentiment analysis","Computational linguistics; Customer review; Design Methodology; Electronic domains; Part of speech tagging; Quality evaluation; Rule-based approach; Rules selection; Set of rules; Quality control",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9","Funding: This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 and title, Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification.",,"Ahamed Kabeer, N.R., Gan, K.H., Haris, E., Domain-specific aspect-sentiment pair extraction using rules and compound noun lexicon for customer reviews (2018) Informatics, 5 (4), p. 45; Bobicev, V., Sokolova, M., Oakes, M., Recognition of sentiment sequences in online discussions (2014) Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP), Dublin, Ireland, 24 August 2014, pp. 44-49; Carrió-Pastor, M.L., A contrastive study of the variation of sentence connectors in academic English (2013) Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 12 (3), pp. 192-202; Cernian, A., Sgarciu, V., Martin, B., Sentiment analysis from product reviews using SentiWordNet as lexical resource (2015) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI), Bucharest, Romania, 25–27 June 2015; Farooq, U., Nongaillard, A., Ouzrout, Y., Qadir, M.A., Product reputation evaluation: the impact of conjunction on sentiment analysis (2013) Proceedings of SKEMA, Chiang Mai, 18–20 December 2013; Htay, S.S., Lynn, K.T., Extracting product features and opinion words using pattern knowledge in customer reviews (2013) The Scientific World Journal, 2013; Liu, B., (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , Morgan and Claypool Publishers; Meena, A., Prabhakar, T., Sentence level sentiment analysis in the presence of conjuncts using linguistic analysis (2007) Advances in Information Retrieva, 4425 (2), pp. 573-580; (2018) Online English grammar, , ≪seurld>http://sana.aalto.fi/awe/cohesion/signposts/contrast/sentence/index.html</seurld≫, available online:, accessed June 2018; Thati, L.S., Adhikesavan, R., Sentence-level sentiment polarity calculation for customer reviews by considering complex sentential structures (2014) International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology, 3 (3), pp. 433-438","Gan, K.H.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: khgan@usm.my",,,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",,,,,17440084,,,,"English","Int.

Travel narratives are among the richest sources of such spatial clues. They are also a reflection of writers’ interaction with places. One of the prevalent ways to model this interaction is a points of interest (POIs) graph depicting popular POIs and routes. A relevant notion is that frequent pairwise occurrences of POIs indicate their geographic proximity. This work presents an empirical interpretation of this theory and constructs spatially enriched POI graphs, a clear augmentation to popularity-based POI graphs. A triplet pattern, rule-based spatial relation extraction technique SpatRE is proposed and compared with standard relation extraction systems Ollie and Stanford OpenIE. A travel blogs data set is also contributed containing labelled spatial relations. The performance is further evaluated on SemEval 2013 benchmark data sets. Finally, spatially enriched POI graphs are qualitatively compared with TripAdvisor and Google Maps to visualise information accuracy. © The Author(s) 2019.","POI graphs; rule-based systems; spatial relation; travel pattern mining; travel planning","Benchmarking; Knowledge based systems; Geographic proximity; Information accuracy; POI graphs; Relation extraction; Spatial information extraction; Spatial relations; Travel pattern minings; Travel planning; Graphic methods",,,,,"1001/PKOMP/811335

The nurse rostering problem (NRP) is a well-known scheduling problem that focuses on determining the day-to-day shift assignments of each nurse. We present a method to investigate the application of automata theory which can be tailored to the requirements of a clinic to satisfy the required workload to the available staff nurses so that the operational demands can be met. It specifically helps to schedule the roster of the nurses according to the conditions of the healthcare organizations.

In this paper, we propose a model with a combination of cellular automaton (CA) and timed automaton (TA) to solve flight delay scheduling problems in two major steps. CA can simulate the aircraft departure queueing process in airport runways through the interaction of cells following some rules while TA is used to control the flight status whether they are delayed or ready to depart using a set of clock values. Although there are few advanced algorithms like linear programming and evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve this scheduling problem, these approaches might not be appropriate to apply in the realtime scheduling problems due to long computation times required to find the optimal solution. Since the flight delay scheduling problem is a NP-hardness (non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness), the computational complexity will be more difficult as well as the time amount to find the solution will be greater with an increasing number of aircrafts. Hence, the work to build a simple model using CA and TA to obtain an optimal scheduling solution with time efficiency is presented in this paper. This proposed model is simple yet efficient enough to provide an optimal solution within a short time for real-time airport runway scheduling problems. © 2020 IEEE.","cellular automata; flight delay scheduling; timed automata","Air traffic control; Aircraft; Airport runways; Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Hardness; Linear programming; NP-hard; Optimal systems; Polynomial approximation; Robots; Scheduling; Aircraft departure; Departure flights; Optimal scheduling; Optimal solutions; Passenger satisfaction; Real time scheduling; Scheduling problem; Time efficiencies; Airport passenger transportation",,,,,,,,"Understanding the Reporting of Causes of Flight Delays and Cancellations, , https://www.bts.dot.gov/topics/airlines-andairports/understanding-reporting-causes-flight-delays-andcancellations, accessed Jun. 18, 2020; What is the Impact of Flight Delays, , https://www.trefis.com/stock/dal/articles/375013/what-is-the-impactof-flight-delays/2016-08-31, accessed Jun. 18, 2020; Ciesielski, V., Scerri, P., An anytime algorithm for scheduling of aircraft landing times using genetic algorithms (1997) Australian Journal of Intelligent Information Process Systems, pp. 206-240; Farah, I., Kansou, A., Yassine, A., Galinho, T., Ant colony optimization for aircraft landings (2011) 2011 4th International Conference on Logistics, Hammamet, pp. 235-240; Weisstein, E.W., Automata Theory, , https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AutomataTheory.html, accessed Jun. 18, 2020; Basics of Automata Theory, , https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/automata-theory/basics.html, accessed Jun. 18, 2020; Shiffman, D., The Nature of Code, , https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/, accessed Jun. 18, 2020; Weisstein, E.W., Cellular Automaton, , https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html, accessed Jun. 18, 2020; Seong, L.O.L., Chee, H.P., Gan, K.H., Cellular automata for evacuation simulation (2019) IEEE International Conference on Dielectric Liquids (ICDL); Witkowski, T., Antczak, A., Elzway, S., Antczak, P., Evolving cellular automata-based flexible job shop scheduling (2009) 2009 Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation, Tianjin, pp. 8-13; Abdeddäm, Y., Asarin, E., Maler, O., Scheduling with timed automata (2006) Theoretical Computer Science, 354 (2), pp. 272-300. , Mar. 28; Bengtsson, J., Yi, W., Timed automata: Semantics, algorithms and tools (2004) Advanced Course on Petri Nets (ACPN).

Ontology learning (OL) from text is a process that aims to (semi-) automatically extract and represent the knowledge from text in machine-readable form. Ontology is considered one of the main cornerstones of representing the knowledge in a more meaningful way on the semantic web. Usage of ontologies has proven to be beneficial and efficient in different applications (e.g. information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering). Nevertheless, manually construction of ontologies is time-consuming as well extremely laborious and costly process. In recent years, many approaches and systems that try to automate the construction of ontologies have been developed. This paper reviews various approaches, systems, and challenges of automatic ontology construction from the text. In addition, it also discusses ways the ontology construction process could be enhanced in the future by presenting techniques from shallow learning to deep learning (DL). © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Concept classification; Deep learning; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Semantic relation","Ontology; Semantic Web; Automatic ontology; Concept classification; Explosive growth; Machine readable form; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Question Answering; Semantic relations; Deep learning",,,,,,,,"Abney, S., Part-of-speech tagging and partial parsing (1997) Corpus-based methods in language and speech processing, pp. 118-136. , Young S, Bloothooft G, (eds), 2, Springer, Netherlands; Albukhitan, S., Helmy, T., Alnazer, A., Arabic ontology learning using deep learning (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence, , Paper presented at the, Leipzig, Germany; Arel, I., Rose, D.C., Karnowski, T.P., Deep machine learning—a new frontier in artificial intelligence research [research frontier] (2010) IEEE Comput Intell Mag, 5, pp. 13-18; Arguello Casteleiro, M., Maseda Fernandez, D., Demetriou, G., Warren, R., Fernandez-Prieto, M.J., des Diz, J., Nenadic, G., Robert, S., (2017) A Case Study on Sepsis Using Pubmed and Deep Learning for Ontology Learning.

Techniques of fake news stories detection ingenious, varied, and exciting. This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analytics and train deep learning models for detecting fake news based on news title or news content. Solution proposed in this study aims to be applied in real-world social media and eliminate the bad experience for user to receive misleading stories that come from non-reputable source. For NLP techniques, text preprocessing such as regular expression, tokenization, lemmatization and stop words removal are used before vectorizing them into N-gram vectors or sequence vectors using terms frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or one-hot encoding respectively. Then, TensorFlow is chosen as the framework to be used with built in Keras deep learning libraries that is having a large community and number of commits on Tensorflow GitHub repository that can be enough to build deep learning neural network models. Results from the models are showing that models trained with news content can achieve better performance with computation time being sacrificed while models trained with news title require less computation time to achieve good performance. Also, overall performance of models fed with N-gram vectors are slightly better than models fed with sequence vectors. © 2020 IEEE.","deep learning; Fake news; Keras; natural language processing; neural network; TensorFlow","Computational linguistics; Industrial electronics; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); State assignment; Text processing; User experience; Vectors; Computation time; Inverse Document Frequency; Learning models; Learning neural networks; NAtural language processing; Nlp techniques; Regular expressions; Text preprocessing; Deep learning",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9, PKOMP6711634","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 (PKOMP6711634) with title “Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification”.",,"Hassan, N.H., New Straits Times, , https://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnists/2019/02/462486/anti-fake-news-act-irrelevant, New Straits Times, 21 February 2019, [Accessed 24 November 2019]; Vasandani, J., (2019) Towards Data Science, , Medium, 9 April; https://towardsdatascience.com/i-built-afake-news-detector-using-natural-language-processing-andclassification-models-da180338860e, [Accessed 24 November 2019]; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/opinion/brazil-electionfake-news-whatsapp.html, M.

However, getting a clear view of the events relevant to the incident from a large set of data, such as social media, is a challenging task. Automation of the forensic and analysis process is the only solution to manage large data sets and get useful information. However, automation in digital forensics is a technical issue with legal implications. The legal system accepts only those automated processes that are reproducible, explainable, and rigorously testable. Therefore, automated forensic processes must be based on formal theories, which are rare in digital forensics. This article explains a theoretical and formal knowledge model for forensic automation on online social networks. This model consists of an event-based knowledge model, which provides theoretical concepts that can assist in the construction and interpretation of the events related to the incident under investigation. The proposed model is implemented through an ontology to provide semantically rich and formal representation to the concepts. This article also describes the feasibility of legally acceptable automated analysis operators, based on a formal theory, for online social network forensics. © 2019","Forensic automation; Forensic ontology; Formal model; Knowledge model; Online social network forensics","Automation; Computer crime; Electronic crime countermeasures; Forensic engineering; Ontology; Social networking (online); Automated analysis; Automated process; Formal model; Formal representations; Knowledge model; Legal implications; On-line social networks; Social media networks; Digital forensics",,,,,,,,"Aledavood, T., Lehmann, S., Saramäki, J., On the digital daily cycles of individuals (2015) Front.

Since there are millions of reviews generated daily in the travel websites, tourist is often overwhelmed with huge information. This is where opinion type detection is important as it makes it easy for a tourist to obtain useful reviews for their understanding and planning processes based on the reviews' opinion type. The opinion type of texts in travel mostly involves different aspects of opinion related to the travel process, such as transportation, accommodation, price, food, entertainment, and so on. The challenge of this research is to improve this detection by proposing the lexical ontology approach to address the issue of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) keywords during a supervised detection of opinion type. Besides, there are also issues where the training data for detection has poor coverage or limited in a certain domain. In this paper, we propose a review opinion type detection approach by integrating the word (feature) expansion approach in machine learning. The suggested approach consists of two stages namely feature expansion and classification. For feature expansion, Lexical Ontology (LO) is used to expand the feature-related word to the domains such as synonyms. For classification, the expanded feature is corporate to the Machine Learning approach to detect the opinion type. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.","Lexical ontology; Online review; Opinion type detection; Text classification; Tourism domain",,,,,,,,,"Kavasoglu, Z., Personalized Summarization Of Customer Reviews Based On User's Browsing History (2013) International Journal on Computer Science and Information Systems, 8 (2), pp. 147-158; Khan, A., Baharudin, B., Lee, L.H., Khan, K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification (2010) Journal of advances in information technology, 1 (1), pp. 4-20. , Feb; Li, Q., Li, S., Zhang, S., Hu, J., A Review of Text Corpus-Based Tourism Big Data Mining (2019) Applied Sciences, 9, pp. 1-27. , Aug; Kowsari, K., Meimandi, K.J., Heidarysafa, M., Mendu, S., Barnes, L., Brown, D., Text Classification Algorithms: A Survey (2019) Information, 10, pp. 1-68. , 2019; Rudkowsky, E., Haselmayer, M., Wastian, M., Jenny, M., Emrich, S., Sedlmair, M., More than Bags of Words: Sentiment Analysis with Word Embeddings (2018) Communication Methods and Measures, pp. 1931-2458. , Apr; Nakade, S.M., Deshmukh, S.N., Finding Semantic Orientation of Reviews Using Unsupervised PMI Algorithm (2016) International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 5 (2), pp. 2107-2110. , Feb; Hu, M., Liu, B., Mining Opinion Features in Customer Reviews Proceedings of the 19th National Conference on Artifical Intelligence, 4 (4), pp. 755-760. , No2004; Vivekanandan, K., Aravindan, J.S., Aspect-based opinion mining: A survey (2014) International Journal of Computer Applications, 106 (3), pp. 21-26. , Nov; Abeysinghe, S., Manchanayake, I., Samarajeewa, C., Rathnayaka, P., Walpola, M.J., Nawaratne, R., Bandaragoda, T., Alahakoon, D., Enhancing Decision Making Capacity in Tourism Domain Using Social Media Analytics (2018) 2018 18th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions, ICTer 2018-Proceedings, pp. 369-375. , Sept; Rezaeinia, S.M., Ghodsi, A., Rahmani, R., Improving the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings for sentiment analysis (2017); Afzaal, M., Usman, M., Fong, A., Tourism Mobile App With Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification Framework for Tourist Reviews (2019) IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 65, pp. 233-241; Soo-Min, K., Eduard, H., Automatic Detection of Opinion Bearing Words and Sentences (2005) Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California, 10, pp. 60-66. , Apr; Wu, L., Hoi, S.C.H., Yu, N., Semantics-Preserving Bag-of-Words Models and Applications (2010) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19 (7), pp. 1908-1920. , July; Porter, M.F., An algorithm for suffix stripping (1980) Program, 14 (3), pp. 130-137. , July; Hill, B.M., Posterior distribution of percentiles: Bayes' theorem for sampling from a population (2014) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 63, pp. 677-691. , Nov; Qu, Z., Song, X., Zheng, S., Wang, X., Song, X., Li, Z., Improved Bayes Method Based on TF-IDF Feature and Grade Factor Feature for Chinese Information Classification (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp), pp. 677-680. , Shanghai, China; Goodfellow, L., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2016) Deep Learning, 1. , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; Wang, W., Huang, Y., Wang, Y., Wang, L., Generalized autoencoder: A neural network framework for dimensionality reduction (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 490-497. , Columbus, OH, USA; Bo, G., Xianwu, H., SVM Multi-Class Classification (2006) Journal of Data Acquisition & Processing, 3, pp. 47-52; Mohri, M., Rostamizadeh, A., Talwalkar, A., (2012) Foundations of Machine Learning, , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; Farzi, R., Bolandi, V., Estimation of organic facies using ensemble methods in comparison with conventional intelligent approaches: A case study of the South Pars Gas Field, Persian Gulf, Iran (2016) Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 2 (105), pp. 1-13; Genkin, A., Lewis, D.D., Madigan, D., Large-scale Bayesian logistic regression for text categorization (2007) Technometrics, 49 (3), pp. 291-304. , Aug",,,,"Science and Information Organization",,,,,2158107X,,,,"English","Intl.

Such content can cause significant confusion for the system. Therefore, there is a need to represent images with only informative features in order to improve the retrieval performance of the system or any subsequent process. In this article, we propose a method to identify the informative features in a large-scale image collection. We apply the frequent itemset mining (FIM) approach to extract visual features patterns from a list of images of the same object. Then, we generate feature pairs to measure the significance of each feature depending on the co-occurrence with its neighbouring features. In addition, we apply this feature selection technique to localise the landmark in the image. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of average precision (AP) on two benchmark data sets and found that it gives a comparable retrieval performance over the bag of visual words baseline system and the previous methods. © The Author(s) 2020.","Feature selection; frequent itemset mining; image retrieval; informative features; object localisation; visual phrases",,,,,,,,,"Lowe, D.G., Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints (2004) Int J Comput Vision, 60 (2), pp. 91-110; Grauman, K., Leibe, B., (2011) Visual object recognition.

However, such classification can be quite challenging due to the short length and sparsity of tweet contents. Although individual tweets have limited length, their contents delve into different topics. Therefore, due to such diverse contents, achieving good coverage of content features remains a challenge. We adopt the expansion of keywords technique in this research and study the enrichment of tweet contents using text from credible sources, such as news sites. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on two Twitter datasets using four standard classifiers. The proposed approach has enhanced the performance of the classification task, with improvements in accuracy ranging from +0.05% to +3.54% for both datasets. Experimental results positively demonstrate that the proposed feature enrichment method can overcome the sparseness limitation of short text with improved classification performances when running on various classifiers. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Classification;

A framework of decision support system (DSS), which suggests optimal strategic actions to be performed, is proposed. The idea is to integrate Finite State Transducer (FST) and fuzzy logic engine in DSS, with ability to capture vague natural language provided by decision makers. The DSS design decisions and business rules are constructed by decision makers based on business prioritised goals. In the proposed framework, the Stochastic Moore Machine (SMM) model, a modified version of FST based on Edward F. Moore is designed with the focus on the non-deterministic behaviour of the state transitions. The machine is integrated with fuzzy logic engine, in the mapping of crisp input of indicators from the management system to membership value for fuzzy operation. The fuzzy value computed will be the input for the probabilistic transition using roulette wheel selection. A case study, detailing how the DSS and SMM work in a small cafe, with the business owner as the strategic planning manager, and two hired employee as operational managers is discussed to illustrate the behaviour of the model based on a triggering event. The case study illustrates how the decisions from business owner and operational managers collectively contribute towards the business goal, by suggesting actions to introduce new menu or reduce fixed expenses. © 2019 IEEE.","Decision Support System (DSS); Finite State Transducer; Fuzzy Logic System; Stochastic Moore Machine","Behavioral research; Computer circuits; Decision making; Decision support systems; Engines; Managers; Sequential machines; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Strategic planning; Business executives; Decision support system (dss); Finite state transducers; Fuzzy logic engines; Fuzzy logic system; Management systems; Natural languages; Roulette wheel selection; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,,,"(2017) Blog] Globalscape, , https://www.globalscape.com/blog/how-disparate-systems-areimpacting-your-business, The Top Three Ways Disparate Systems are Negatively Impacting Your Business [Accessed 20 May 2019]; https://www.myob.com/content/dam/myobredesign/nz/docs/5-impacts.pdf, MYOB Enterprise Solutions (n.d.). 5 impacts disparate systems have on your business.

Hence, a computer-based cellular automaton model that uses microscopic approach is used to simulate emergency evacuation from a room to save costs and resources. This paper proposes a cellular automaton-based emergency evacuation simulation model which consists of two main parts. The former is a conventional cellular automaton that is used to simulate the propagation of fire and smoke, while the latter is an additional list-like data structure that is used to keep track of human movements across the cells that represent the evacuation space to overcome the former's limitation on simultaneous changes of multiple cells. To further improve the model, human behaviour during emergency evacuation such as competing for space is also simulated through conflict resolution based on age and gender with several assumptions. Nevertheless, complex human behaviour such as herd effect is not under consideration in this model. For demonstration purpose, this model is used to simulate emergency evacuation from a computer lab based on a modifiable distance map where each cell is labelled with one of the 8 predefined states used to represent the room. Hence, it is also applicable to other types of indoor rooms. © 2019 IEEE.","automata theory; cellular automata; emergency evacuation; evacuation simulation; human behaviour","Behavioral research; Robots; Smoke; Cellular automaton models; Conflict Resolution; Emergency evacuation; Evacuation simulation; Human behaviours; Human movements; Multiple cells; Physical experiments; Cellular automata",,,,,,,,"WBDG-Whole Building Design Guide, , National Institute of Building Sciences, 28 September 2017; Weisstein, E.W., Automata Theory, , MathWorld-A Wolfram Web Resource; Weisstein, E.W., Cellular automaton MathWorld-A Wolfram Web Resource; Kari, J., (2013) Cellular Automata; Tissera, P.C., Printista, M., Errecalde, M.L., Evacuation simulations using cellular automata (2007) Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 7 (1), pp. 14-20; Zhou, Z., Zhou, Z., Cai, H., An analysis of pedestrians (2019) Behavior in Emergency Evacuation Using Cellular Automata Simulation, , arXiv; Makmul, J., (2016) Microscopic and Macroscopic Models for Pedestrian Crowds; Li, M., Zhao, Y., He, L., Chen, W., Xu, X., The parameter calibration and optimization of social force model for the real-life 2013 Ya'an earthquake evacuation in China (2015) Safety Science, pp. 243-253; Song, W., Yu, Y., Fan, W., A cellular automata evacuation model considering friction and repulsion (2005) Science China Technological Sciences, 48 (4), pp. 403-413; Xie, R., Li, L., Simulation of optimized evacuation processes in complex buildings using cellular automata model (2014) Journal of Software, 9 (6), pp. 1428-1434; Tissera, P.C., Castro, A., Printista, A.M., Luque, E., Simulating behaviours to face up an emergency evacuation (2014) Computing Research Repository",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 IEEE Conference on Sustainable Utilization and Development in Engineering and Technologies, CSUDET 2019","7 November 2019 through 9 November 2019",,163824,,9781728132761,,,"English","IEEE Conf.

Most methods proposed in the literature use traditional approaches that emphasize term frequency. These methods perform reasonably with traditional documents. However, these approaches are unsuitable for social network data with limited length and where sparsity and noise are characteristics of short text. A simple supervised term weighting approach, i.e., SW, which considers the special nature of short texts based on term strength and term distribution, is introduced in these study, and its effect in a high-dimensional vector space over term weighting schemes, which represent baseline term weighting in traditional text classification, are assessed. Two datasets are employed with support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression algorithms. The first dataset, Sanders dataset, is a benchmark dataset that includes approximately 5000 tweets in four categories. The second self-collected dataset contains roughly 1500 tweets distributed in six classes collected using Twitter API. The evaluation applied tenfold cross-validation on the labeled data to compare the proposed approach with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that supervised approaches perform varied performance, predominantly better than the unsupervised approaches. However, the proposed approach SW has better performance than other ones in terms of accuracy. SW can deal with the limitations of short texts and mitigate the limitations of traditional approaches in the literature, thus improving performance to 80.83 and 90.64 (F-measure) on Sanders dataset and a self-collected dataset, respectively. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Classification;

Thus, the need to classify this type of document based on their content has a significant implication in many applications. The need to classify these documents in relevant classes according to their text contents should be interested in many practical reasons. Short-text classification is an essential step in many applications, such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, Twitter personalization, customer review and many other applications related to social networks. Reviews on short text and its application are limited. Thus, this paper aims to discuss the characteristics of short text, its challenges and difficulties in classification. The paper attempt to introduce all stages in principle classification, the technique used in each stage and the possible development trend in each stage. Design/methodology/approach: The paper as a review of the main aspect of short-text classification. The paper is structured based on the classification task stage. Findings: This paper discusses related issues and approaches to these problems. Further research could be conducted to address the challenges in short texts and avoid poor accuracy in classification. Problems in low performance can be solved by using optimized solutions, such as genetic algorithms that are powerful in enhancing the quality of selected features. Soft computing solution has a fuzzy logic that makes short-text problems a promising area of research. Originality/value: Using a powerful short-text classification method significantly affects many applications in terms of efficiency enhancement. Current solutions still have low performance, implying the need for improvement. This paper discusses related issues and approaches to these problems. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Feature selection; Sentiment analysis; Short text; Social networks","Classification (of information);

Law enforcement agencies and legal practitioners frequently utilize social networks to quickly access the information related to the participants of any illicit incident. However, the forensic process needs collection and analysis of the information which is immense, heterogeneous, and spread across multiple social networks. This process is technically intricate due to heterogeneous and unstructured online social networks (OSNs). Hence, creating cognitive challenges and massive workloads for the investigators. Therefore, it is imperative to develop automated and reliable solutions to assist investigators. Capturing the forensic information in the structured form is crucial for automation, sharing, and interoperability. This paper introduces the design of a multi-layer framework; from collection to evidence analysis. The central component of this framework is a hybrid ontology approach that involves multiple ontologies to manage the unstructured data and integrate various social media data collections. This approach aims to find the evidence by automated methods that are trustworthy and therefore admissible in a court of law. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid Ontology model; Online social network forensics; Social network analysis; Social network forensic automation","Automation; Information management; Ontology; Semantics; Social networking (online); Forensic acquisition; Forensic information; Law-enforcement agencies; Online social networks (OSNs); Ontology model; Semantic framework; Social media datum; Social media networks; Digital forensics",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","This study is partially funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia RUI grant, Account No. [ 1001/PKOMP/8014017 ].",,"Abiodun, O.I., Jantan, A., Omolara, A.E., Dada, K.V., Mohamed, N.A.E., Arshad, H., State-of-the-art in artificial neural network applications: a survey (2018) Heliyon, 4 (11); Adam Belsher, N.D., The Growth of Digital Evidence Backlogs and Making Them a Thing of the Past - Magnet Forensics Inc (2016), https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/growth-digital-evidence-backlogs-making-thing-past/, [WWW Document] accessed 1.20.17; Al Mutawa, N., Al Awadhi, I., Baggili, I., Marrington, A., Forensic artifacts of Facebook's instant messaging service (2011) 6th International Conference on Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, pp. 771-776; Al Mutawa, N., Baggili, I., Marrington, A., Forensic analysis of social networking applications on mobile devices (2012) Digit.

Timeliness of data is important in making major decision. However, the manual data labeling method is slow and expensive, it also cannot cope with this enormous amount of data. We investigated the literature of sentiment analysis and discovered most of the works using manual data labeling. We propose semi-supervised learning as a method that helps to reducing the effort and time needed in data labeling as it uses a combination of small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data for model training. In our work, we trained semi-supervised deep neural network with different settings and compared the model performances to a baseline, the supervised deep neural network trained with same number of labeled data. From the results, we can see that the unlabeled data is useful in improving the data performances. But it is not a guarantee, the unlabeled data must be handled with care otherwise degraded the model performances. © 2019 The Authors.","Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment classification","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning; Data labeling; Data performance; Model performance; Model training; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised; Sentiment classification; Unlabeled data; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 and title, Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification.",,"Liu, (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , Morgan & Claypool; Hutto, C.J., Gilbert, E., Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text (2014) Proceedings of the Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 216-225; Priyani, G., Gupta, V., Singh, V.K., Ghose, U., A linguistic rule-based approach for aspect-level sentiment analysis of movie reviews (2017) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing; Agarwal, B., Mittal, N., Machine learning approach for sentiment analysis (2015) Socio-Affective Computing, pp. 21-45. , Springer; Chiong, R., A sentiment analysis-based machine learning approach for financial market prediction via news disclosures (2018) Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion on - GECCO'18, pp. 278-279; Tripathy, A., Agrawal, A., Rath, S.K., Classification of sentiment reviews using n-gram machine learning approach (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 117-126; Fernández-Gavilanes, Álvarez-López, Juncal-Martínez, Costa-Montenegro, González-Castaño, Unsupervised method for sentiment analysis in online texts (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 58, pp. 57-75; Tan, Phang, Chin, Anthony, Rule-based sentiment analysis for financial news (2015) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pp. 1601-1606. , Kowloon; Na, Kyaing, Khoo, Foo, Chang, Theng, Sentiment classification of drug reviews using a rule-based linguistic approach (2012) ICADL 2012: The Outreach of Digital Libraries: A Globalized Resource Network, , Chen H, Chowdhury G eds Berlin, Springer; Prabowo, Thelwall, Sentiment analysis: A combined approach (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (2), pp. 143-157; Faulkner, Automated classification of stance in student essays: An approach using stance target information and the wikipedia link-based measure (2014) Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, pp. 174-179; Lane, Clarke, Hender, On developing robust models for favourability analysis: Model choice, feature sets and imbalanced data (2012) Decision Support Systems, 53 (4), pp. 712-718; Araque, Corcuera-Platas, Sánchez-Rada, Iglesias, Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 77, pp. 236-246; Hassan, Mahmood, Deep learning approach for sentiment analysis of short texts (2017) 3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR), pp. 705-710. , Nagoya; Dai, Le, Semi-supervised Sequence Learning (2015) NIPS'15 Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3079-3087; Iosifidis, Ntoutsi, Large scale sentiment learning with limited labels (2017) Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD'17, pp. 1823-1832. , ACM Press, New York, NY; Levatić, Ceci, Kocev, Džeroski, Semi-supervised Classification Trees (2017) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 49 (3), pp. 461-486; Pang, Lee, Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales (2005) ACL'05 Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 115-124; Guan, Chen, Zhao, Zheng, Tan, Cai, Weakly-supervised deep learning for customer review sentiment classification (2016) IJCAI'16 Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 3719-3725. , New York, NY","Gan, K.H.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: khgan@usm.my","Younus A.",,"Elsevier B.V.","5th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2019","23 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,156995,18770509,,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

Many studies attempt to extract parallel text from existing resources, particularly from comparable texts. The approaches to extract parallel text from comparable text can be divided into sentence-level approach and fragment-level approach. In this paper, an approach that combines sentence-level approach and fragment-level approach is proposed. The study was evaluated using statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT). The experiment results show a very significant improvement in the BLEU scores of SMT and NMT. The BLEU scores for SMT for the test in computer science domain and news domain increase from 17.45 and 41.45 to 18.56 and 48.65 respectively.

These three planes are integrated as the input streams for the Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet). The main objective of including the input patches from triplanar views is to enrich the ConvNet with more context information to aid in the classification of liver tumor. The input patches are extracted from liver Computed Tomography (CT) dataset using center pixel of interests from the triplanar views. These patches are fed into the proposed Triplanar ConvNet. Pilot experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of using triplanar views in comparisons with single-view from axial plane. The preliminary results achieved in this study revealed that triplanar approach yield better results than using patches only from single-view. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Convolutional neural network; Liver tumor segmentation; Triplanar","Classification (of information); Computer vision; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Neural networks; Robotics; Context information; Convolutional neural network; Coronal planes; Liver tumor segmentations; Pilot experiment; Pilot studies; Pixel of interests; Triplanar; Tumors",,,,,,,,"Lecun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition (1998) Proc.

Hence, automated opinion mining is used to extract important features (aspect) and related comments (sentiment). Extraction of correct aspect-sentiment pairs is critical for overall outcome of opinion mining; however, current works still have limitations in terms of identifying special compound noun and parent-child relationship aspects in the extraction process. To address these problems, an aspect-sentiment pair extraction using the rules and compound noun lexicon (ASPERC) model is proposed. The model consists of three main phases, such as compound noun lexicon generation, aspect-sentiment pair rule generation, and aspect-sentiment pair extraction. The combined approach of rules generated from training sentences and domain specific compound noun lexicon enable extraction of more aspects by firstly identifying special compound noun and parent-child aspects, which eventually contribute to more aspect-sentiment pair extraction. The experiment is conducted with the SemEval 2014 dataset to compare proposed and baseline models. Both ASPERC and its variant, ASPER, result higher in recall (28.58% and 22.55% each) compared to baseline and satisfactorily extract more aspect sentiment pairs. Lastly, the reasonable outcome of ASPER indicates applicability of rules to various domains. © 2018 by the authors.","Aspect extraction; Lexicon; Opinion mining; Rule-based; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment extraction",,,,,,"1001/PKOMP/811335

The extractive method in text summarization tends to include unnecessary sentences alongside the important ones during the sentence selection process, which affected the summary's coherent and readability. Most techniques in Sentence Compression relies on heavy syntactic knowledge and external resources to decide on the compression decision, but still fail short in preserving the informativeness of the summary. From the automatic and manual evaluation, the compressed summary produced by our MYTextSum model by referring to the discovered human sentence compression pattern named Frequent Eliminated Pattern (FASPe) has shown promising results with the improvement as high as 23.5% against the uncompressed summary method. © 2018 IEEE.","Malay; pattern growth; sentence compression; text summarization","Information retrieval; Text processing; Automated summaries; External resources; Informative ness; Malay; Pattern growth; Sentence compression; Sentence selection; Text summarization; Knowledge management",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811295","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Research University Grant (RU) by project number 1001/PKOMP/811295.

The commonly used text representation model is Bags-of-Words (BOW) and the N-gram model. Nevertheless, some known issues of these models, which are inaccurate semantic representation of text and high dimensionality of word size combination, should be investigated. A pattern-based model named Frequent Adjacent Sequential Pattern (FASP) is introduced to represent the text using a set of sequence adjacent words that are frequently used across the document collection. The purpose of this study is to discover the similarity of textual pattern between documents that can be later converted to a set of rules to describe the main news event. The FASP is based on the Pattern-Growth’s divide-and-conquer strategy where the main difference between FASP and the prior technique is in the Pattern Generation phase. This approach is tested against the BOW and N-gram text representation model using Malay and English language news dataset with different term weightings in the Vector Space Model (VSM). The findings demonstrate that the FASP model has a promising performance in finding similarities between documents with the average vector size reduction of 34% against the BOW and 77% against the N-gram model using the Malay dataset. Results using the English dataset is also consistent, indicating that the FASP approach is also language independent. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Document similarity; Malay language; Pattern-Growth; Sequential Pattern Mining; Text representation",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811295","Acknowledgement This work is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Research University Grant (RU) by project number 1001/PKOMP/811295.",,"Baharudin, B., Lee, L.H., Khan, K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification (2010) J Adv Inf Technol, 1 (1), pp. 4-20; Zhang, W., Yoshida, T., Tang, X., A comparative study of TF* IDF, LSI and multi-words for text classification (2011) Expert Syst Appl, 38 (3), pp. 2758-2765; Lewis, D.D., (1992) Text representation for intelligent text retrieval: a classification-oriented view.

The translation produced by an SMT is based on the statistical analysis of text corpora, while NMT uses the deep neural network to model and to generate a translation. SMT and NMT have their strength and weaknesses. SMT may produce a better translation with a small parallel text corpus compared to NMT. Nevertheless, when the amount of parallel text available is large, the quality of the translation produced by NMT is often higher than SMT. Besides that, study also shown that the translation produced by SMT is better than NMT in cases where there is a domain mismatch between training and testing. SMT also has an advantage in long sentences. In addition, when a translation produced by an NMT is wrong, it is very difficult to find the error. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid approach that combines SMT and NMT to perform English to Malay translation. The motivation for using a hybrid machine translation is to combine the strength of both approaches to produce a more accurate translation. Our approach uses the multi-source encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The architecture uses two encoders, one to embed the sentence to be translated, and another encoder to embed the initial translation produced by SMT. The translation from the SMT can be viewed as a ""suggestion translation"" to the neural MT. Our experiments show that the hybrid MT increases the BLEU scores of our best baseline machine translation in the computer science domain and news domain from 21.21 and 48.35 to 35.97 and 61.81 respectively. © 2018, Insight Society.","Hybrid machine translation; Neural machine translation; Statistical machine translation",,,,,,,,,"Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) ""Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate"", , CoRR abs/1409.0473; Luong, T., Pham, H., Manning, D.C., ""Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation,"" (2015) Proc.

Therefore, a trip planning system generally aims to propose popular points of interests (POIs) and routes in a region structured as a POI graph. The proposed framework aims to utilize travel blogs to accumulate this information. Accordingly, existing approaches have employed frequent pattern mining to construct a POI graph that results in frequency-weighted POIs and route recommendation. The suggested model incorporates a multi-criteria weighting scheme that is contrary to the conventional POI graph. To facilitate travel decision-making, the proposed framework treats frequency measure as an initial weight and further processes blog entries to extract the opinions related to POIs and spatial information between POIs weighting nodes and edges, respectively. A final consolidated weight for each component is computed using defined functions. The contribution has significance for ordinary travelers in efficiently planning their itineraries, as well as for destination management organizations, in realizing the travelling trend and designing tourism products and strategies accordingly. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

A summary can serve as a condensed version of a text, where salient information can be presented. In order to improve a summary’s quality, a special task in the area of Automatic Text Summarization known as Sentence Compression (SC) can be applied. Existing SC techniques are highly dependent on syntactic knowledge applied on individual word or phrases to decide on the compressions decision. In contrast, this study introduces a new constrained Pattern-Growth SC (PGSC) technique inspired by the “divide and conquer” strategy tailored to the Malay language. The basic idea is to divide the sentences into segments where unimportant segments are removed while the important ones are conquered iteratively. Using a Malay news dataset, the application of PGSC have shown promising results where the compressed summaries reported an F-Measure score of 0.5752 agreements when evaluated against manual human summaries and perform better than the Baselines (uncompressed) model. Manual human evaluation produced readability score of 4.31 out of 5 and 4.1 for content responsiveness, suggesting a better quality and readability of the compressed summaries produced by the MYTextSum model. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Malay; Sentence Compression; Sequential Pattern-Growth; Text Summarization","Compaction; Iterative methods; Quality control; Text processing; Automatic text summarization; Divide and conquer; F-measure scores; Human evaluation; Malay; Sentence compression; Sequential patterns; Text summarization; Tellurium compounds",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 1001/PKOMP/811295","This work is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Research University Grant (RU) by project number 1001/PKOMP/811295.","Acknowledgement.

The information overload disorients some travel knowledge seekers in choosing preferred places and visiting them in an appropriate order. Hence, a trip planning system mainly deals with collecting popular points of interests (POIs) in a region and proposing routes accordingly. In contrast to the various data sources of tour planning, travel blogs have been paid less attention. The massive text contained in these narratives manifests bloggers’ interactions with places that have been modeled with different graph representations. This review concentrates on the problem of extracting this graph-structured information from travel blogs with an explicit focus on POI graph, the fundamental trip planning structure that facilitates travel decision making. The study first discusses an analysis of travel blog mining and its dominant research themes, based on which three distinct categories of graphs are proposed. Each category of graphs is further explored using practical cases followed with a comparative analysis of existing works including their techniques, dataset and evaluation metrics. With the underlying idea of enhancing travel planning process with better POI graphs, the existing literature is critically assessed at the end along with a number of promising directions for future research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Frequent sequential pattern mining; Place semantics; POI graph; Spatial relations; Travel planning",,,,,,,,,"Adams, B., McKenzie, G., Inferring thematic places from spatially referenced natural language descriptions (2013) Crowdsourcing geographic knowledge: volunteered geographic information (VGI) in theory and practice, pp. 201-221. , Sui D, Elwood S, Goodchild M, (eds), Springer, Dordrecht; Aggarwal, C.C., Wang, H., Graph data management and mining: a survey of algorithms and applications (2010) Managing and mining graph data.

These reviews provide a significant basis on which potential customers can select the product that best meets their preferences. In online reviews, customers describe positive or negative experiences with a product or service or any part of it (i.e. features). Consumers frequently experience difficulty finding the desired product for comparison because of the massive number of online reviews. The automatic extraction of important product features is necessary to support customers in search of relevant product features. These features are the criteria that make it possible for customers to characterise different types of products. This article proposes a domain independent approach for identifying explicit opinionated features and attributes that are strongly related to a specific domain product using lexicographer files in WordNet. In our approach, N_gram analysis and the SentiStrength opinion lexicon have been employed to support the extraction of opinionated features. The empirical evaluation of the proposed system using online reviews of two popular datasets of supervised and unsupervised systems showed that our approach achieved competitive results for feature extraction from product reviews. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Feature extraction; lexicographer file; N_gram; sentiment analysis; SentiStrength; WordNet","Extraction; Feature extraction; Online systems; Ontology; lexicographer file; N_gram; Sentiment analysis; SentiStrength; Wordnet; Sales",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811335","This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/811335: Mining Unstructured Web Data For Tour Itineraries Construction), USM.",,"Liu, B., (2012) Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, 5 (1), pp. 1-167. , San Rafael, CA, Morgan & Claypool Publishers, (Synthesis lectures on human language technologies), no; Kavasoğlu, Z., Gündüz Öğüdücü, Ş., Personalized summarization of customer reviews based on user’s browsing history (2013) Int J Comput Sci Inf Syst, 8 (2), pp. 147-158; Gao, Q., Abel, F., Houben, G., A comparative study of users’ microblogging behavior on Sina Weibo and Twitter (2012) User modeling, adaptation, and personalization, pp. 88-101. , Masthoff, Mobasher, Desmarais, (eds), Berlin, Springer,.

Supporting the probable customers with a list of the most representative product aspects will assist their purchasing decision and facilitate the comparative process among the presented products. For the firms, identifying critical product aspects creates a new perspective of product manufacturing and marketing strategies to be competitive and innovative. However the manual identification of the most representative product aspects from the huge amounts of the extracted product aspects in online reviews is a tedious and time-consuming task. Thus, ranking the extracted aspects becomes a necessity to identify the important product aspects mentioned in the customer reviews. The purpose of this study is to formulate the product aspect ranking problem as a decision making process using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). In response, a comparative analysis between two different MCDM ranking approaches, namely; TOPSIS and VIKOR has been conducted to investigate their performances in prioritizing the most important product aspects in customer reviews. The experimental results on different product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods in prioritizing the genuine product aspects in customer feedback. © 2017 IEEE.","Aspect ranking; MCDM; Product aspect; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; VIKOR","Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Marketing; Aspect ranking; MCDM; Product aspects; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; VIKOR; Sales",,,,,,,,"Hu, M., Liu, B., Mining opinion features in customer reviews (2004) 19th Natl.

Most of the conducted research studies extract the product aspects based on three main criteria: 1) extracting the aspects that have been commented repeatedly in online reviews, 2) determining of important aspects as those that have been described positively and negatively by many customers in their reviews, and 3) the association between the domain product aspect (like 'camera') and the other aspects contained in a specific product review. However, a lacuna remains as how to efficiently investigate online reviews to identify the most important product aspects by considering all the three criteria jointly. In response, this paper proposes a novel product aspect ranking framework using sentiment analysis and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The proposed work is decomposed into two stages: aspect extraction and aspect ranking. In aspect extraction stage, sentiment analysis is used to identify the product aspects from customer reviews in an unsupervised manner based on the three criteria of extraction. In the second stage, the extracted product aspects from the previous criteria have been involved simultaneously in TOPSIS to produce a ranked list of the most representative product aspects. The empirical evaluation of the proposed work using online reviews of four products shows its effectiveness in finding representative aspects. © 2016 IEEE.","Aspect ranking; MCDM; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; WordNet","Extraction; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Sales; Aspect ranking; MCDM; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; Wordnet; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synth.

However, if the summary was extracted 'verbatim' from its source, the sentence may contain inessential information along with salient information that may effect on the overall coherence in the summary generation. The purpose of Sentence Compression in Text Summarization is to produce a compact and informational content by eliminating unnecessary constituent in a sentence. We introduce a Pattern-Growth text representation model named Frequent Adjacent Sequential Pattern (FASP) and Frequent Eliminated Pattern (FASPe) to represent the text using a set of sequence adjacent words or 'textual pattern' that are frequently used and eliminated across the Malay news document collection. From the discovered textual pattern, we derived some heuristic Sentence Compression Rules in generating compressed sentences to construct a single extract Malay summary. We conducted experiments on Malay news dataset and the result demonstrates that moderate compressed summary using Sentence Compression Rules has better agreement with human composed summary. © 2016 IEEE.","component;

As these reactions are valuable indicators for social and political well beings, we are motivated to automate the classification of news texts based on these indicators, e.g. happy, sad, angry, amused etc. Unlike other review texts that contain more explicit words which can be interpreted directly for sentiment classification, news texts mostly report facts and figures. This resulted in needs to identify whether contents of news can be exploited for classification or otherwise. Hence, in this work, a study is conducted to analyze and determine the relevant key parts of news contents that can be to be used for sentiment-based classification. Two criteria, i.e. text Part of Speech and text position, which could possible influence the training of the classifier are studied. Evaluations are conducted on the collection of 250 English news texts labelled with sentiments from sentiment voting system. The results for sentiment-based category has recorded F score of 0.422 whereas for polarity-based category has recorded F score of 0.837. The study has shown that when finer categories (e.g. happy, sad etc.) are used, the inspected criteria are less effectively; however, when these categories are based on polarity orientations, the outcomes show potentials of the proposed criteria especially for text positioned at headlines and text using adjective words. © 2018 The Authors.","News Sentiment; Text Analysis; Text Classification","Classification (of information); Information systems; Tellurium compounds; Voting machines; News content; News Sentiment; Part Of Speech; Sentiment classification; Sentiment-based classification; Text analysis; Text classification; Voting systems; Text processing",,,,,"1001/PKOMP/811335

The attractiveness of LSTM networks is its strength in modeling long distance dependencies. Malay POS tagging is examined from two different conditions: with and without morphological information.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to automate the construction of such queries from common query like keywords or form-based queries. Design/methodology/approach-In this paper, the authors address the problem of constructing queries for XML retrieval by proposing a semantic-syntax query model that can be used to construct different types of structured queries. First, a generic query structure known as semantic query structure is designed to store query contents given by user. Then, generation of a target language is carried out by mapping the contents in semantic query structure to query syntax templates stored in knowledge base. Findings-Evaluations were carried out based on how well information needs are captured and transformed into a target query language. In summary, the proposed model is able to express information needs specified using query like NEXI. Xquery records a lower percentage because of its language complexity. The authors also achieve satisfactory query construction rate with an example-based method, i.e. 86 per cent (for NEXI IMDB topics) and 87 per cent (NEXI Wiki topics), respectively, compare to benchmark of 78 per cent by Sumita and Iida in language translation. Originality/value-The proposed semantic-syntax query model allows flexibility of accommodating new query language by separating the semantic of query from its syntax. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Formal reasoning about web dynamics; Language and representation issues of web semantics; Web structure/linkage mining","Information retrieval systems; Knowledge based systems; Query languages; Semantics; Syntactics; XML; Example-based methods; Information request; Language complexity; Language translation; Structured queries; Web dynamics; Web semantics; Web structures; Query processing",,,,,,,,"Bao, Z., Lu, J., Ling, T.W., Chen, B., Towards an effective xml keyword search (2010) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 22 (8), pp. 1077-1092; Carmel, D., Maarek, Y., Mandelbrod, M., Mass, Y., Soffer, A., Searching xml documents via xml fragments (2003) Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, ACM, New York, NY, pp. 151-158; Chamberlin, D.D., Xquery: An xml query language (2002) IBM Systems Journal, 41 (4), pp. 597-615; Cohen, S., Mamou, J., Kanza, Y., Sagiv, Y., Xsearch: A semantic search engine for xml (2003) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 29, pp. 45-56. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id_1315451.1315457, VLDB Endowment; Fallside, D.C., Walmsley, P., Xml schema part 0: Primer second edition (2004) W3C Recommendation, , www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0; Gan, K.H., Phang, K.K., A query transformation framework for automated structured query construction in structured retrieval environment (2014) Journal of Information Science, 40 (2), pp. 249-263; Graupmann, J., Biwer, M., Zimmer, C., Zimmer, P., Bender, M., Theobald, M., Weikum, G., Compass: A concept-based web search engine for HTML, xml, and deep web data (2004) Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 30, pp. 1313-1316. , VLDB Endowment; Jayapandian, M., Jagadish, H.V., Automated creation of a forms-based database query interface (2008) PVLDB, pp. 695-709; Kim, J.Y., Xue, X.B., Croft, W.B., A probabilistic retrieval model for semistructured data (2009) ECIR, pp. 228-239; Kohavi, R., A study of cross-validation and bootstrap for accuracy estimation and model selection (1995) Proceedings of the 14th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2, pp. 1137-1143. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco, CA; Li, J., Liu, C., Zhou, R., Ning, B., Processing xml keyword search by constructing effective structured queries (2009) APWEB/WAIM, 5446, pp. 88-99. , Li, Q., Feng, L., Pei, J., Wang, X.S., Zhou, X. and Zhu, Q.-M.

Sentence Compression is a technique where unimportant details from a sentence are eliminated by preserving the sentence’s grammar pattern. In this study, we conducted an analysis on our developed Malay Text Corpus to discover the rules and pattern on how human summarizer compresses and eliminates unimportant constituent to construct a summary. A Pattern-Growth based model named Frequent Eliminated Pattern (FASPe) is introduced to represent the text using a set of sequence adjacent words that is frequently being eliminated across the document collection.

Due to the diversities of concepts used in XML resources, it is not easy to select a correct concept when constructing an XML query. Design/methodology/approach'In this paper, a Context-based Term Weighting model that performs term weighting based on part of documents. Each part represents a specific context, thus offering better capturing of concept and term relationship. For query time analysis, a Query Context Graph and two algorithms, namely, Select Target and Constraint (QC) and Select Target and Constraint (QCAS) are proposed to find the concepts for constructing XML query. Findings'Evaluations were performed using structured document for conference domain. For constraint concept selection, the approach CTXTW achieved better result than its baseline, NCTX, when search term has ambiguous meanings by using context-based scoring for the concepts. CTXTW also shows its stability on various scoring models like BM25, TFIEF and LM. For target concept selection, CTXTW outperforms the standard baseline, SLCA, whereas it also records higher coverage than FCA, when structural keywords are used in query. Originality/value'The idea behind this approach is to capture the concepts required for term interpretation based on parts of the collections rather than the entire collection. This allows better selection of concepts, especially when a structured XML document consists many different types of information. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Indexing and retrieval of XML data; Web search and information extraction; Web structure/linkage mining","Data mining; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; World Wide Web; XML; Automatic selection; Design/methodology/approach; Structural concept; Structured document; Term relationship; Web searches; Web structures; XML data; Query processing",,,,,,,,"Bao, Z., Lu, J., Ling, T.W., Chen, B., Towards an effective xml keyword search (2010) IEEE Transactions on Know Ledge and Data Engineering, 22 (8), pp. 1077-1092; Boag, S., Berglund, A., Chamberlin, D., Simeon, J., Kay, M., Robie, J., Fernandez, M.F., Xml path language (xpath) 2.0 (2007) W3C Recommendation, W3C, , www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-xpath20-20070123/, January available at; Bray, T., Paoli, J., Sperberg-McQueen, C.M., Extensible markup language (xml) (1997) World Wide Web Journal, 2 (4), pp. 27-66; Carmel, D., Maarek, Y., Mandelbrod, M., Mass, Y., Soffer, A., Searching xml documents via xml fragments (2003) Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, ACM, pp. 151-158. , New York, NY; Chamberlin, D.D., Xquery: An xml query language (2002) IBM Systems Journal, 41 (4), pp. 597-615; Cohen, S., Mamou, J., Kanza, Y., Sagiv, Y., Xsearch: A semantic search engine for xml (2003) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases-Volume 29, VLDB '03, pp. 45-56. , VLDB Endowment; Fallside, D.C., Walmsley, P., Xml schema part 0: Primer second edition (2004) W3C Recommendation, , October; Gan, K.H., Phang, K.K., A query transformation framework for automated structured query construction (2014) Journal of Information Science, 40 (2), pp. 249-263; Gan, K.H., Phang, K.K., (2014) An Intermediate Query Model for Structured Retrieval's Queries Construction, IiWAS, pp. 289-295. , Hanoi, 4-6 December; Graupmann, J., Biwer, M., Zimmer, C., Zimmer, P., Bender, M., Theobald, M., Weikum, G., Compass: A concept-based web search engine for HTML, xml, and deep web data (2004) Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, VLDB Endowment, 30, pp. 1313-1316; Hsu, W., Lee, M.L., Wu, X., Path-Augmented keyword search for xml documents (2004) Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI '04, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 526-530. , Washington, DC; Huffman, S.B., Baudin, C., Toward structured retrieval in semi-structured information spaces (1997) IJCAI, 1, pp. 751-757. , Morgan Kaufmann, Burlington; Itakura, K.Y., Clarke, C.L.A., A framework for bm25f-based xml retrieval (2010) SIGIR ACM, pp. 843-844. , in Crestani, F., Marchand-Maillet, S., Chen, H.H., Efthimiadis, E.N. and Savoy, J.

On Twitter, users can tweet about certain topic during occurrence of events. This results in trending topics, such as #MH370, #MH17, #South Korea ferry etc. When viewing trending topic, not all the tweets are relevant to one self. Therefore, it is important to classify these tweets based on individual preference for better information retrieval. To address this problem, this paper focuses on automated personalization of tweets for popular trending topics. The main objective is to classify the tweets information as ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" on a particular topic depending on personal preference by feature selection. For enhancement, topicrelated keywords are selected as features for representing a category model from user preferred tweets and other sources like news. Finally, the result of experiment shows promising outcome that a training based on low number of tweets can give quick personalization on next incoming tweets. © 2015 The Authors.

However, these annotations come from different sources like Wordnet thesaurus, POS, DTD, semantic roles etc. These annotations can either be combined in the same document or captured separately in different document. The former, though richer in annotations, may look messy and requires more parsing time. The latter needs control of document consistency. This paper proposes a string-trees model to represent XML document for multiple sources of annotations. This model extends the existing string-tree structure for linguistic content in order to support structured contents of XML document.

In order to access the structured contents, information requests are formulated in the form of query languages supported by the structured retrieval systems. Nevertheless, information requests at this layer cannot be specified directly by end users. Hence, a common solution is to map information needs obtained from the application layer to the query language of a retrieval system automatically. Although rule-based approach can be used to generate query automatically, it is designed for a single target query language, whereas, there are not one but different types of structured queries with different forms of syntax used in a structured retrieval environment. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing structured queries for structured retrieval by proposing an intermediate query model that can be used to construct different types of structured queries. This model allows flexibility of accommodating new query language by separating the semantic of query from its syntax. Firstly, rule-based approach is used to construct a generic form of query known as semantic query structure. Then, generation of query into target language is carried out by matching templates obtained from example-based method. Evaluations were carried out based on how well information needs are captured and transformed into a target query language. In summary, the proposed model is able to express information needs specified using query like NEXI. Xquery records a lower percentage due to its language complexity. We also achieve satisfactory query conversion rate with our example-based method, i.e. 86% (for NEXI IMDB topics) and 87% (NEXI Wiki topics) respectively compare to benchmark of 78% by Sumita & Iida in language translation.

These resources have advantages compared with the normal web resources as they have additional annotations that can be utilized when composing a search request. However, structured query languages used by these retrieval systems are not meant for normal searchers. This article addresses this problem by automating the construction of a structured query from a keywords query that is more familiar to the web search user. As a result, a query transformation framework is proposed. Different from the existing framework, which is a one-time solution, our proposed framework has greater flexibility in accommodating new structured query languages and different collection types. A novel intermediate query representation is designed to handle transformation to multiple types of query languages, whereas a context-based probabilistic model is designed to capture the structural features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous collections. Experimental results show that the structured queries generated from our framework give promising results compared with their source queries. This finding suggests that the framework can potentially be used in search applications to improve their search features. © The Author(s) 2014.","Query interpretation; query transformation; structured retrieval; XML","Heterogeneous collections; Probabilistic modeling; Query interpretation; Query representations; Query transformations; Research and development; Structured Query Language; Structured retrieval; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Query processing; World Wide Web; XML; Query languages",,,,,,,,"Boag, S., Berglund, A., Chamberlin, D., Siméon, J., Kay, M., Robie, J., (2007) XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0.

Incorporation of concepts like role, category, topic, class, attributes, etc. to indicate the search target and constraints in a structured query enable better definition of information needs. However, the varieties of usages in application contexts create heterogeneity of structures definition and presentation, thus making it hard of using this information when formulating structured query for a search process. Hence, we are motivated to automate transformation of unstructured queries (which are more common for web user), to structured queries (which support better specification of information needs). This paper first explores two important issues arisen in the process of query transformation, i.e. multiple structures (with respect to the needs of handling multiple structured queries type) and multiple semantics (with respect to the needs of handling different collections of structured resources). Along with these issues, we define research problems, followed by an approach of mediating multiple structures and multiple semantics to support the query transformation from unstructured to structured form. © 2011 IEEE.","Query transformation; search; semantic structures; structured retrieval","Application contexts; Information need; Multiple structures; Query transformations; Research problems; search; Search process; semantic structures; Structured queries; Structured retrieval; Unstructured queries; Web users; Information science; Query processing; Semantic Web; Semantics; Stairs; User interfaces; Information retrieval",,,,,,,,"Boitet, C., Zaharin, Y., Representation trees and string-tree correspondences (1988) Proc. of COLING 1988, pp. 22-27. , Budapest, Hungry, August; Hsu, W., Lee, M.L., Wu, X., Path-augmented keyword search for XML documents (2004) Proc. of ICTAI 2004, pp. 526-530. , (Boca Raton, Florida, November 15 - 17).

As the number of categories increases, it becomes more difficult to organize, manage and look up information from existing categories. In this paper, categories are annotated with concept features to facilitate the access, retrieval and sharing of information in the categories. We have observed that training texts is crucial in learning the concept of a category and serves as a good measure to help human to construct the category model. Hence, we present a study on training texts selection and evaluate the effectiveness of training texts, as well as its capability to complement human's knowledge in constructing the category model. Experimental evaluation shows that using training texts approach in category model construction gives promising results in both effectiveness and complement measures. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Information systems; Text processing; Category model construction; Category models; Information diversify; Texts selection; Information management",,,,,,,,"Ricardo, B.Y., Berthier, R.N., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison Wesley Longman; Lewis, D., Evaluating and Optimizing Autonomous Text Classification Systems (1995) Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR, pp. 246-254. , Seattle Washington; Yamamoto, M., Church, K.W., Using Suffix Arrays to Compute Term Frequency and Document Frequency for All Substrings in a Corpus (2001) Computational Linguistics, 27 (1), pp. 1-30. , March; Osinski, S., Stefanowski, J., Weiss, D., Lingo: Search Results Clustering Algorithm Based on Singular Value Decomposition (2004) Proceedings of the Intelligent Information Processing and Web Mining, (IIPWM 2004), pp. 359-368. , Springer, Zakopane, Poland, May; Tan, S.S., Gan, K.H., Tang, E.K., Cheong, S.L., Chan, S.L., Foo, W.Y., MICE: Aggregating and Classifying Meta Search Results into Self-Customized Category (2004) Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2004), pp. 771-772. , Beijing China, Sept; Tan, S.S., Gan, K.H., Chan, H.Y., Tang, E.K., Cheong, S.L., Mapping Search Results into Self-Customized Category Model (2004) Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing (ICIIP, pp. 311-323. , Beijing China, Oct; Tan, S.S., (2002) Topic Hierarchy Annotation using Feature Selection Technique, , MSc.

This paper presents a method that learns semantics from structured information of these resources. Instead of committing the semantic meaning of resources to strict and formal vocabularies like ontology or data dictionary, we are interested to interpret the meaning based on the natural context of the resources. The semantics are used in search process, i.e. query reasoning and resource selection, to provide better answer in terms of context relevancy and clearer result description. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Learning systems; Resource allocation; XML; Semantic meaning; Web resources; Semantic Web",,,,,,,,"Sivashanmugam, K., Sheth, A., Miller, J., Verma, K., Aggarwal, R., Rajasekaran, P., Metadata and Semantics for Web Services and Processes (2003) Datenbanken und Informationssysteme, , Hagen; Lexxe Search Engine, , http://www.lexxe.com; Brin, S., Page, L., The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine (1998) Proceedings of the 7th Int.

There is a need to help user to access and identify relevant information in a flexible way. This paper describes a methodology that automatically map web search results into user defined categories. This allows the user to focus on categories of their interest, thus helping them to find for relevant information in less time. Text classification algorithm is used to map search results into categories. This paper focuses on feature selection method and term weighting measure in order to train an optimum and simple category model from a relatively small number of training texts. Experimental evaluations on real world data collected from the web shows that our classification algorithm gives promising results and can potentially be used to classify search results returned by search engines. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.","Feature selection; Information retrieval; Results classification; Self-customized categories","Feature extraction; Information retrieval; Search engines; Text processing; Classification algorithm; Experimental evaluation; Feature selection methods; On-line information; Results classifications; Self-customized categories; Text classification; Web search results; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Liu, C., A Survey: Automatic Text Categorization (2004) CS412 Report, , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Joachims, T., A Probabilistic Analysis of the Rocchio Algorithm with TFIDF for Text Categorization (1997) In Proceedings of the 14' International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML97), pp. 143-151; Chen, H., Dumais, S.T., Bringing Order to the Web: Automatically Categorizing Search Results (2000) In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2000), pp. 145-152; Chen, H.S., Dumais, T., Cytrell, E., Optimizing Search by Showing Results in Context (2001) In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2001), pp. 277-284; Liu, H.H.D., Motoda, H., Consistency Based Feature Selection (2000) Proceedings of the Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-2000), , In; Mladenic, D., Grobelnik, M., Word sequences as features in text-learning (1998) In Proceedings of ERK-98, the seventh Electro-technical and Computer Science Conference, pp. 145-148; Sahami, M., Koller, D., Toward Optimal Feature Selection (1996) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML96), pp. 284-292. , In, San Franscisco CA, Morgan Kaufmann; Salton, G., Buckley, C., (1988) Term Weighting Approaches in Automatic Text Retrieval, , In Technical Report, COR-87-881, Department of Computer Science, Cornell University; Tan, S.S., (2002) Topic Hierarchy Annotation using Feature Selection Technique, , MSc Thesis, School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia",,,"Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence;IFIP TC12/WG12.3;The China Computer Federation","Springer New York LLC","IFIP TC12/WG12.3 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, IIP 2004","21 October 2004 through 23 October 2004","Beijing",105755,18684238,038723151X; 9780387231518,,,"English","IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902515017

This paper describes a rank aggregation model that incorporates text analysis measure with existing rankbased method, e.g. Best Rank and Borda Rank, to aggregate search results from various search systems. This approach provides means to normalize the differences of rank methodology used by different search systems, justifying the potential of using contents analysis to improve the results relevancy in meta search. In this paper, we fully describe our approach on text normalization for meta search and present our rationality of using two rankbased methods in our model. We then evaluate and benchmark the performance of our model based on user judgment on results relevancy. Our experiment results show that when text analysis factor is taken into account, the results outperform the rank-based methods alone. This shows the potential of our model to complement current rank aggregation methods used in meta search. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.","Information retrieval; Meta search; Normalization; Ranking; Search results aggregation","Benchmarking; Information retrieval; Meta search; Model-based OPC; Normalization; Problem domain; Rank aggregation; Ranking; Text analysis; Text normalizations; Safety devices",,,,,,,,"Jansen, B.J., The effect of query complexity on Web searching results (2000) Information Research, 6 (1); Jansen, B.J., Spink, A., Saracevic, T., Real life, real users, and real needs: A study and analysis of user queries on the web (2000) Information Processing and Management, 36 (2), pp. 207-227. , Elsevier; Ricardo, B.Y., Berthier, R.N., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , ACM Press Series/Addison-Wesley, New York; Dwork, C., Kumar, R., Naor, M., Sivakumar, D., Rank Aggregation Methods for the Web (2001) WWWIO, , ACM, Hong Kong; Harman, D., The Development and Evolution of TREC and DUC (2003) NTCIR Workshop; Sullivan, D., (2003) Search Engine Watch: Major Search Engines and Directories, , http://searchenginewatch.eom/links/article.php/2156221/; Voorhess, E.M., The Philosophy of Information Retrieval Evaluation (2001) 2nd Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, CLEF 2001, pp. 355-370. , Darmstadt, Germany; Aslam, J.A., Montague, M., Model for Metasearch (2001) SIGIR'Ol, pp. 276-284. , ACM, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Renda, M.E., Straccia, U., Web Metasearch: Rank vs. Score Based Rank Aggregation Methods (2003) SAC2003, , ACM, Melbourne, Florida, USA; Mahabhashyam, M.S., Singitham, P., (2002) Tadpole: A Meta search engine, , CS276A Report, Standford",,,"Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence;IFIP TC12/WG12.3;The China Computer Federation","Springer New York LLC","IFIP TC12/WG12.3 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, IIP 2004","21 October 2004 through 23 October 2004","Beijing",105755,18684238,038723151X; 9780387231518,,,"English","IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902472994
