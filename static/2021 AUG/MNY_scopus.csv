Though, their security is often challenged by adversaries such as Botnet. Botnet leverages the encrypted channel to launch attacks and amplify the impact of attacks. The numbers of Botnet attacks over an encrypted channel are increasing and continue to cause a great loss of money. This study proposes an encrypted Botnet detection technique based on packet header analysis. This technique does not require deep packet inspection and intense traffic analysis. However, the proposed technique requires the analysis of the features taken from the packet header, which are essential for detection. The study endeavors to show that features selected can significantly affect the classification of encrypted Botnet. Therefore, in this paper, the researchers focus on the effects of feature selection on the classification of encrypted Botnet. The researchers use different classification mode (full training and 10-fold cross-validation) mainly by using seven features (7-features) and three features (3-features). Seven features are the number of features extracted from the packet header, and after the feature selection, only three features out of the seven features have weight (value). Therefore, the three features are the most significant features from the seven features that have been extracted. Generally, the result shows that classification with three most significant features provides higher true positive compared to the 7-features classification. Different machine learning algorithms have been used for the classification. Relatively, the results show that the True Positives are higher for 3-features classification than 7-features classification. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Encrypted botnet; Feature selection; Machine learning; Packet header analysis","Botnet; Cryptography; Feature extraction; Information dissemination; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; 10-fold cross-validation; Botnet detections; Deep packet inspection; Packet header; Traffic analysis; True positive; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017","This research is supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia through Research University (RUI) Grant, titled “Enhancing Botnet Detection Efficiency and Accuracy using Machine Learning Techniques” (Account Number 1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017).","(2019) Enterprise Network Security - Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA)., , https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/enterprise-network-security/eta.html#~stickynav=1, Accessed 22 March 2019; Schwartz, M.J., (2015) Police Disrupt Banking Malware Botnet but Worldwide Impact of Ramnit Takedown May Prove Temporary., , https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-police-target-ramnit-botnet-a-7947, Accessed 20 March 2019; (2010) Cybersecurity Malaysia.: Malaysia Vs Malware., , http://www.cybersecurity.my/en/knowledge_bank/news/2010/main/detail/1900/index.html, Accessed 12 May 2016; (2018) Cloudbric.: 3 Devastating Cyber Attacks on Banks that Show How Vulnerable Our Money Is., , https://www.cloudbric.com/blog/2015/09/3-devastating-cyberattacks-on-banks-that-show-how-vulnerable-our-money-is/, Accessed 21 March 2019; Zelster, L., (2015) When Bots Use Social Media for Command and Control, , https://zeltser.com/bots-command-and-control-via-social-media/, Accessed 24 March 2019; Bortolameotti, R., (2014) C&C Botnet Detection over SSL, , https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5a2e/8739648c9a8a1b57c090845df28a8ffac2b6.pdf, .

Cloud computing still faces lots of challenges, topmost is security and privacy of its data. Among of the data security challenges the cloud faces are data (breach, loss, retention, segregation and remanence etc.). But remanence which is the residue of data that still remains in storage after deletion, is a crucial challenge most especially in the cloud and has received minimal attention from the users and CSP (cloud service providers). Data breach and disclosure by unauthorized persons can occur in different forms among of which is improper disposal of data when it is no longer needed. We will be reviewing various work related to data remanence, its challenges, and its prospects. This will help and guide researchers, cloud users, and cloud service providers, etc., in knowing and understanding better this challenge that poses a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and authorization of data in the cloud environment. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","CIA triad; Cloud security; Data breach; Data remanence; Secure deletion","Data visualization; Digital storage; Information management; Privacy by design; Remanence; Side channel attack; Storage as a service (STaaS); Cloud environments; Cloud service providers; Data remanence; Future challenges; Security and privacy; Security challenges; Software and hardwares; Visualization technique; Green computing",,,,,,,"Vaquero, L., Rodero-Merino, L., Caceres, J., Lindner, M.: A break in the clouds: towards a cloud definition.

Using synergistic threats to attack provides many success alternatives that lead to the same goal, which is to take over the network and carry out illegal mining activities using CPU resources from the victim's computer. One of the main motives for the success of this criminal business is its relatively low cost and high return of investment. Using the infection chain method in carrying out cryptocurrency mining malware attacks with fileless techniques involves loading malicious code into system memory. Monero (XMR) is by far the highest popular cryptocurrency among threat actor installing mining malware because it comes with full anonymity and resistance to an application-specific circuit mining (ASIC). This work proposes a better method for classifying conventional malware and cryptocurrency mining malware. On the other hand, grouping specific of suitable features extracted from the sources of EMBER dataset shown as malware and need to categorize as a cryptocurrency mining malware. The proposed approach is defining a better algorithm for enhancing accuracy and efficiency for cryptocurrency mining malware detection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Costs; Crime; Cryptocurrency; Machine learning; Application specific; Criminal business; Government agencies; Machine learning approaches; Malware detection; Mining activities; Private companies; Return of investments; Malware",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6315237","members in the Security & Forensics Research Group, Universiti Sains Malaysia, for their helpful discussion and suggestion.

One of the Botnet evasion techniques is by hiding their command and control communication over an encrypted channel like SSL and TLS. This paper provides a Botnet Analysis and Detection System (BADS) framework for detecting Botnet. The BADS framework has been used as a guideline to devise the methodology, and we divided this methodology into six phases: i. data collection, customization, and conversion, pp. feature extraction and feature selection, ipp. Botnet prediction and classification, iv. Botnet detection, v. attack notification, and vi. testing and evaluation. We tend to use the machine learning algorithm for Botnet prediction and classification. We also found several challenges in implementing this work.

Therefore, a NDN-based content routing mechanism was compared with two types of HCN routing protocol implementations in this study: OLSR and Batman-adv. The experimental results obtained from this research provide early evidence that NDN can increase the energy efficiency of MANET compared to the use of HCN primarily TCP/IP on the network stack solution for MANET. Of particular note would be NDN-based content routing’s viability as a solution for energy consumption issues that plague wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks. Last but not least, this paper also provides the future research direction that could be undertaken on the subject. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy efficiency; HCN; Host-centric; MANET testbed; Mobile ad hoc network; Named data networking; NDN; OLSR and Batman-adv","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Future research directions; Host-centric; Manet testbed; Named data networkings; OLSR and Batman-adv; Prominent features; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless multi-hop; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,,,"Sarkar, S.K., Basavaraju, T.G., Puttamadappa, C., (2013) Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks: Principles, Protocols, and Applications, , 2nd edn.

While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.","MANET detailed; Mobile Ad hoc Network; real mobility; real-testbed","Budget control; Costs; Grid computing; Remote control; Technology transfer; Testbeds; Algorithms and protocols; Evaluation tool; Low-cost electronics; Low-cost robots; MANET detailed; Manet testbed; Open hardware; Rudimentary structures; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,,,"Lenders, V., Wagner, J., May, M., Analyzing the impact of mobility in ad hoc networks (2006) Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Multi-Hop Ad Hoc Networks: From Theory to Reality, REALMAN '06, pp. 39-46. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Amjad, K., From simulation to testbed: An, indoor MANET performance analysis study (2012) Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC 2012) Loughborough, pp. 1-4; Benmoshe, B., Berliner, E., Dvir, A., Performance monitoring framework for Wi-Fi MANET 2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC 2013), pp. 4463-4468; Cuervo, E., Gilbert, P., Wu, B., Cox, L., CrowdLab: An architecture for volunteer mobile testbeds (2011) 2011 Third International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2011, pp. 1-10; Do, V.T.M., Landmark, L., Kure, O., Testbed-based performance evaluation of a connectionless multicast protocol for MANETs (2014) 2014 11th International Symposium on Wireless Communications Systems (ISWCS 2014), pp. 276-281; Hiyama, M., Kulla, E., Oda, T., Ikeda, M., Barolli, L., Experimental results, of a MANET testbed in a mixed environment considering horizontal and vertical topologies (2012) 2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA 2012), pp. 884-889; Kulla, E., Sakamoto, S., Ikeda, M., Barolli, L., Xhafa, F., Kamo, B., Evaluation of a MANET, testbed for central bridge and V-shape bridge scenarios using BATMAN routing protocol (2013) 2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA 2013), pp. 199-205; Kulla, E., Ikeda, M., Oda, T., Barolli, L., Xhafa, F., Takizawa, M., Multimedia transmissions, over a MANET Testbed: Problems and Issues (2012) 2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS 2012), pp. 141-147; Messeguer, R., Ochoa, S.F., Pino, J.A., Medina, E., Navarro, L., Royo, D., Neyem, A., Building real-World Ad-Hoc networks to support mobile collaborative applications: Lessons learned (2009) Groupware: Design, Implementation, 5784, pp. 1-16. , Use L.

However, the misuse of social media and instant messaging services facilitated conducting different cybercrimes such as cyber stalking, cyber bullying, slander spreading, and sexual harassment. Therefore mobile devices are an important evidentiary piece in digital investigation. In this chapter we report the results of our investigation and analysis of social media and instant messaging services in Firefox OS. We examined three social media services (Facebook, Twitter, and Google. +) as well as three instant messaging services (Telegram, OpenWapp, and Line).

Network traffic forensics plays an important role in cybercrime investigation to detect subject(s) and object(s) of the crime. In this chapter we detect and analyze residual network traffic artifacts of FxOS in relation to two popular social networking applications (Facebook and Twitter) and one instant messaging application (Telegram). We utilized a FxOS simulator to generate relevant traffic while all communication data were captured using network monitoring tools.

However, the misuse of social media and instant messaging services facilitated conducting different cybercrimes such as cyber stalking, cyber bullying, slander spreading, and sexual harassment. Therefore mobile devices are an important evidentiary piece in digital investigation. In this chapter we report the results of our investigation and analysis of social media and instant messaging services in Firefox OS. We examined three social media services (Facebook, Twitter, and Google. +) as well as three instant messaging services (Telegram, OpenWapp, and Line). Our analysis may pave the way for future forensic investigators to trace and examine residual remnants of forensics value in Firefox OS. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The arrival of this Firefox OS has created new challenges, concentrations and opportunities for digital investigators. Currently, Firefox OS is still not fully supported by most of the existing mobile forensic tools. Even when the phone is detected as Android, only pictures from removable card was able to be captured. Furthermore, the internal data acquisition is still not working. Therefore, there are very huge opportunities to explore the Firefox OS on every stages of mobile forensic procedures. This paper will present an approach for mobile forensic data acquisition in a forensically sound manner from a Firefox OS running device. This approach will largely use the UNIX dd command to create a forensic image from the Firefox OS running device. © 2014 IEEE.","data acquisition; Firefox OS; Mobile forensic","Computer operating systems; Data acquisition; Open systems; Digital investigators; Firefox; Mobile forensics; Mozilla; Open source operating systems; Computer crime",,,,,,,"Firefox OS, , https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS, Mozilla Developer Network, 07-May-2013; Goodwin, R., Mozilla's Boot 2 Gecko and Why It Could Change the World, , http://www.knowyourmobile.com/products/16409/mozillasboot-2-gecko-and-why-it-could-change-world, 07-May-2013; Barmpatsalou, K., Damopoulos, D., Kambourakis, G., A critical review of 7 years of Mobile Device Forensics (2013) Digit.

Mozilla Corporation recently released Linux-based open source operating system, named Firefox OS. The emergence of Firefox OS has created new challenges, concentrations and opportunities for digital investigators. In general, Firefox OS is designed to allow smartphones to communicate directly with HTML5 applications using JavaScript and newly introduced WebAPI. However, the used of JavaScript in HTML5 applications and solely no OS restriction might lead to security issues and potential exploits. Therefore, forensic analysis for Firefox OS is urgently needed in order to investigate any criminal intentions. This paper will present an approach and methodology in forensically sound manner for Firefox OS. © 2014 IEEE.","digital investigation; Firefox OS; Forensic Method; Mobile forensics","Computer operating systems; Electronic crime countermeasures; High level languages; HTML; Open systems; Smartphones; Digital investigation; Digital investigators; Firefox; Forensic investigation; Forensic Method; Mobile forensics; Mobile operating systems; Open source operating systems; Computer crime",,,,,,,"Gartner says worldwide smartphone sales reached its lowest growth rate with 3.7 per cent increase in fourth quarter of 2008 (2012) Gartner, , http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=910112, Gartner Inc, 15-Feb-2013; Gartner says annual smartphone sales surpassed sales of feature phones for the first time in 2013 (2014) Gartner, , http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2665715, Gartner Inc, 20-Feb-2014; First look at mozilla's web platform for phones: 'boot to gecko' (2012) TechHive, , http://www.techhive.com/article/250879/first_look_at_mozilla_s_web_platform_for_phones_boot_to_gecko.html, Pcw.

Malware classification system is important and work together with malware identification to prepare the right and effective antidote for malware. Current techniques in malware classification do not give a good classification result when it deals with the new and unique types of malware. For this reason, we proposed the usage of Genetic Algorithm to optimize the malware classification system as well as help in malware prediction. The new malware classification system is based on malware target and its operation behavior. The result from this study will create a new framework that designed to optimize the classification of malware. This new malware classification system also has an ability to train and learn by itself, so that it can predict the current and upcoming trend of malware attack. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Genetic Algorithm; Malware Classification; Unique Malware","Classification results; Classification system; Malware attacks; Malwares; Behavioral research; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Software engineering; Computer crime",,,,,,,"Gheorghescu, M., An Automated Virus Classification System (2005) Virus Bulletin Conference Microsoft; Aycock, J., (2006) Computer Virus and Malware, , Springer, Heidelberg; Filiol, E., Viruses and Malware (2010) Handbook of Information and Communication Security, pp. 747-769. , Springer, Heidelberg; Rieck, K., Holz, T., Willems, C., Düssel, P., Laskov, P., Learning and Classification of Malware Behavior (2008) LNCS, 5137, pp. 108-125. , Zamboni, D.
