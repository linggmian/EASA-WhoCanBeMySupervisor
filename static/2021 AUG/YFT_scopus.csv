However, the poor performance of traditional mobile IP protocols can affect negatively delay sensitive services. Recently, network-based IP mobility has been proposed as a potential solution. Although initial evaluations have already confirmed the practical advantages of this new approach, a proper investigation of existing methods has yet to be performed. In the present paper, an evaluation framework is proposed to investigate handover performance metrics in network-based IP mobility. The framework is subsequently employed to analyze prominent methods. Analytical results highlight the efficiency of each solution under different operating conditions and reveal the main factors that affect the performance. Unlike other comparative studies, this framework has been developed to assist IP mobility designers in analyzing the effects of system parameters on their proposed solutions. A new prediction-based mobility solution for metropolitan area networks is suggested, and its design parameters are analyzed by utilizing the proposed framework. The present study not only provides deeper insights into network-based IP mobility but also a framework for faster analysis of future solutions in this category.

Its basic configuration consists of two stages: an input stage and an output stage. The input stage consists of input group modules (IGMs) and output stage output group modules (OGMs). Each IGM-OGM pair is connected by multiple paths which carry cells from IGMs to OGMs. Excess cells at the IGMs are recycled to minimize the cell loss probability. Another module called recirculation module is used to couple several IGMs together to create additional routes for recirculating cells which gives this architecture robustness against nonuniform and directed traffic. Multicasting has been implemented by integrating copying and broadcasting techniques, and using some novel techniques to minimize the switch complexity. A shared buffer architecture is employed for OGMs such that it implements multiple priorities dynamically in a weighted manner, requires no speedup, and, can function in standalone mode as small switches. The performance of Bodhi has been evaluated by computer simulation to select design parameters for a Ifc x Ik (k = 1024) switch fabric. It allows growability from 2.4 gigabit to 150 gigabit switch, and, expandability to 100+ Terrabit switch with the complexity increasing approximately linearly with size. Based on the study presented in this paper, it is seen that the Bodhi architecture offers a high degree of modularity, weighted dynamic priority control, robustness against nonuniform traffic conditions, low complexity, low latency, and, supports multicasting efficiently and without any limitation. Bodhi, therefore, has high potential for application in high speed broadband networks.","ATM switch; Broadcast; Growability; Modularity; Multicast","Broadcasting; Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Congestion control (communication); Switching systems; Telecommunication traffic; Input group modules (IGM); Multicasting; Output group modules (OGM); Asynchronous transfer mode",,,,,,,"Huang, A., And S.

The multicast cells are first separated from the unicast cells. Then a multicast cell is routed using either the broadcast approach or the copy approach, depending on its number of destinations. Cell replication is done by fan-out without using a copy network. This approach allows fast multicast call set-up, fast additions and deletions of the destinations from an on-going multicast call, supports up to N destinations per call in a N×N switch. It implements multicasting with minimum amount of memory and, requires minimum increase in the switch complexity. The paper illustrates the implementation of this technique on a 64×64 three-router sunshine switch architecture and discusses how it can be implemented on other switch fabric configurations.",,"Asynchronous transfer mode; Buffer circuits; Buffer storage; Communication channels (information theory); Computational complexity; Computer architecture; Packet switching; Switching networks; Cell replication; Multicast call setup; Multicasting; Data communication systems",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, Jagan P.; Univ of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, United States","Anon","IEEE","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE International Performance Computing & Communications Conference","5 February 1997 through 7 February 1997","Phoenix, AZ, USA",46342,,,00258,,"English","IEEE Int Perform Comput Commun Conf Proc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030642653
