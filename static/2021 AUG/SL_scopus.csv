However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing. The proposed approach outperforms with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.47 as compared to the highest scoring DBSCAN based method with MAE 27.03. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; Citizen security; crime prediction; safe city; smart cities,Artificial intelligence; Crime; Forecasting; Hierarchical clustering; Safety engineering; Smart city; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Mean absolute error; Prediction model; Resource management; Safety and securities; Temporal information; Urban population; Predictive analytics,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1,"Corresponding authors: Umair Muneer Butt (umair@student.usm.my), Sukumar Letchmunan (sukumar@usm.my), and Fadratul Hafinaz Hassan (fadratul@usm.my) This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1, and in part by the School of Computer Sciences USM.","Spencer, N., Butler, D., Cities: The century of the city (2010) Nature, 467 (7318), pp. 900-901; Cicirelli, F., Guerrieri, A., Spezzano, G., Vinci, A., An edge-based platform for dynamic smart city applications (2017) Future Gener.

The authors were unable to find a comprehensive study on crime hotspot detection and prediction while conducting this SLR. Therefore, to the best of author's knowledge, this study is the premier attempt to critically analyze the existing literature along with presenting potential challenges faced by current crime hotspot detection and prediction systems. The SLR is conducted by thoroughly consulting top five scientific databases (such as IEEE, Science Direct, Springer, Scopus, and ACM), and synthesized 49 different studies on crime hotspot detection and prediction after critical review. This study unfolds the following major aspects: 1) the impact of data mining and machine learning approaches, especially clustering techniques in crime hotspot detection; 2) the utility of time series analysis techniques and deep learning techniques in crime trend prediction; 3) the inclusion of spatial and temporal information in crime datasets making the crime prediction systems more accurate and reliable; 4) the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art techniques and the future research directions. Moreover, the SLR aims to provide a core foundation for the research on spatiooral crime prediction applications while highlighting several challenges related to the accuracy of crime hotspot detection and prediction applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Its usage has increased dramatically in recent years but not seen extensive application in EEG based Brain computer interface (BCI) problems. There is a wide range of classifiers which may not perform well, when used separately for classification problem but outperforms state-of-art algorithm when used as an ensemble, i.e., Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) is considered as best learning algorithms when time is embedded in input but not shown outstanding performance when used individually for EEG classification. On the contrary, it provided real good results when used as an ensemble. Aim: Aim of this study is how EEG signals can be classified using Ensembles methods; its importance and usage are described with experimental results. Approach: The approach that is being used is, combining different classifiers, i.e. Support vector machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Logistic Regression (LR) and see which classifiers work best with which ensemble technique for EEG classification’s problem. Datasets: Datasets are taken from well-known data resources, Kaggle, EEG data set of confused students. The second dataset is taken from GitHub having EEG signals with timestamps according to events, i.e., sound, light, etc. According to our results, the LSTM- ensemble outperformed all other algorithms in the case where time is embedded in data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Classification; EEG signals; Ensemble methods,Brain; Brain computer interface; Decision trees; Human computer interaction; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Data resources; EEG classification; Eeg datum; EEG signals; Ensemble learning; Ensemble techniques; Time stamps; Biomedical signal processing,,,,,,,"Mureșan, R., Jurjuț, O., Moca, V., Singer, W., Nikolić, D., The oscillation score: an efficient method for estimating oscillation strength in neuronal activity (2008) J.

In recent years, the growth of digital libraries and video databases makes it more challenging and important to extract useful information from raw data to prevent and detect the crimes from the database automatically. Street crime snatching and theft detection is the major challenge in video mining. The main target is to select features/objects which usually occurs at the time of snatching. The number of moving targets imitates the performance, speed and amount of motion in the anomalous video. The dataset used in this paper is Snatch 101; the videos in the dataset are further divided into frames. The frames are labelled and segmented for training. We applied the VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network architecture algorithm and extracted the features of objects and compared them with original video features and objects. The main contribution of our research is to create frames from the videos and then label the objects. The objects are selected from frames where we can detect anomalous activities. The proposed system is never used before for crime prediction, and it is computationally efficient and effective as compared to state-of-the-art systems. The proposed system outperformed with 81 % accuracy as compared to stateof-the-art systems. © Science and Information Organization.",AlexNet; Anomalous detection; ConvoNet; Surveillance video; VGG16; VGG19,,,,,,,,"Manjunath, T., Hegadi, R.S., Ravikumar, G., A survey on multimedia data mining and its relevance today (2010) IJCSNS, 10 (11), pp. 165-170; Mabrouk, A.B., Zagrouba, E., Abnormal behavior recognition for intelligent video surveillance systems: A review (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 480-491; Chen, X., Zhang, C., An interactive semantic video mining and retrieval platform-application in transportation surveillance video for incident detection (2006) Data Mining, 2006.

In this paper, we used a structured dataset of Santander bank, which is published on a data science and machine learning competition site (kaggle. com) to predict whether a customer would make a transaction or not? The dataset consists of two classes, and it is imbalanced. To handle imbalance as well as to achieve the goal of prediction with the least log loss, we used a variety of methods and algorithms. The provided dataset is partitioned into two sets of 200,000 entries each for training and testing. 50% of data is kept hidden on their server for evaluation of the submission. A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of datasets is performed to check the distributions of values. Correlation between features and importance of characteristics is calculated. To calculate the feature importance, random forest and decision trees are used. Furthermore, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are used for dimensionality reduction. We have used 9 different algorithms including logistic regression (LR), Random forests (RF), Decision tree (DT), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Gradient boosting method (GBM), Category boost (CatBoost), Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and Light gradient boosting (LigtGBM) method on the dataset. We proposed LighGBM as a regression problem on the dataset and it outperforms the stateof-the-art algorithms with 85% accuracy. Later, we have used fine-tune hyperparameters for our dataset and implemented them in combination with the LighGBM. This tuning improves performance, and we have achieved 89% accuracy. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.",AdaBoost; Banking; CatBoost; Dimensionality reduction; DT; EDA; GBM; Hyperparameter;

Along the years, the increasing demand for these services has led to long queue problems in the clinic. As a result, the clinic becomes congested during peak hours, leaving both patients and healthcare staffs dissatisfied. Apart from Sejahtera Centre, long queue issue has been a common problem in many government outpatient departments across Malaysia. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-cost, user-friendly clinic management system that consists of a web application for clinic staff and a hybrid mobile application for patients. Real-time queue monitoring and queue forecasting using Time-Series Extrapolation is incorporated to help patients avoid peak hours and empower better clinic workforce management in handling different patient flow peaks. The web-based appointment approach allows patients to conveniently reschedule their appointments online and receive appointment reminders via the mobile application. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, a prototype is developed and evaluated based on several interviews. The prototype serves as a basic working model that outlines the feasibility of the proposed concepts to improve queue issues in other clinics across Malaysia. © 2019 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).",Appointment system; Healthcare; Queue forecasts,,,,,,,"The authors wish to acknowledge the School of Computer Sciences (SoCS) and Sejahtera Centre of University of Science, Malaysia for their support in providing us various resources in developing the proposed system.

However, the adoption of this innovation is slowed by security challenge. Apparently, the use of only TLS (transport layer security) security technique for SOSE systems is inappropriate because it provides only point-to-point security support to the communicating parties. While, an end-to-end security mechanism is necessary to effectively secure SOSE applications. Consequently, this paper provides SNSM framework, a solution to SOSE security challenge by integrating many technologies including OASIS's web service security standard, W3C's XML digital signature and XML encryption standards into SOAP envelope to ensure end-to-end security at the message level. In the implementation of the framework, proxy service, a virtual service hosted in the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) was used to enforce security services as a Quality of service (QOS) requirement. The results show that SNSM framework recorded 10 millisecond average response time above unsecured service, whereas, the TLS secured service has the largest average response time. © 2016 IEEE.",Security Challenge; SNSM Framework; SOAP message; SOSE,Application programs; Control systems; Cryptography; Network function virtualization; Quality of service; Response time (computer systems); Software design; System of systems; Web services; XML; End-to-end application; Enterprise service bus; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Security challenges; SNSM Framework; SOAP messages; Transport layer security; XML digital signatures; Network security,,,,,,,"Ahmed, M.M., Letchmunan, S., A systematic literature review on challenges in service oriented software engineering (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9 (6), pp. 173-186; Schmelzer, R., (2002) XML and Web Services, , USA: Sams Publishing; Muneera, B., Ikram, N., Niazi, M., Requirements engineering challenges in service oriented software engineering: An exploratory online survey (2013) International Journal for Software Engineering (IJSE), 6 (2), pp. 21-43; Ali Arsanjani, L.-J.Z., Ellis, M., Allam, A., Channabasavaiah, K., (2007) S3 Service-Oriented Reference Architecture, , IEEE Computer society; O'Neill, M., Hallan-Baker, P., Cann, M.S., Shema, M., Simon, E., Watters, P.A., White, A., (2003) Web Services Security, , Berkeley, California McGraw-Hill; (2011) SOA Reference Architecture., , Group T.

Due to the huge amount of user-generated contents over blogs, forums, social media, etc., sentiment analysis has attracted researchers both in academia and industry, since it deals with the extraction of opinions and sentiments. In this paper, we have presented a review of topic modeling, especially LDA-based techniques, in sentiment analysis. We have presented a detailed analysis of diverse approaches and techniques, and compared the accuracy of different systems among them. The results of different approaches have been summarized, analyzed and presented in a sophisticated fashion.

Consequently, this paper embraces a systematic literature review to classify and analyze SOSE Challenges claimed in research communities from January 2009 to October 2014. First, the search string was applied to each selected database and the title, abstract and keywords of the potentially relevant primary studies were examined where 693 primary studies were found relevant. Then, the full texts of the 693 relevant studies were critically reviewed. As a result, 91 primary studies with 122 claimed SOSE challenges were identified and recorded. The results revealed quality of service (QOS) as the major SOSE Challenge, it is responsible for about 45% of the total SOSE challenges claimed for the period under review. Further investigation revealed Security as the main attribute responsible for placing QOS as the major SOSE challenge. It is recommended that research effort is required to improve the security of SOA applications. In addition, other areas that require research effort are Service provision and integration. © 2015 SERSC.",Challenges; SOSE; SOSE challenges; Systematic literature review,,,,,,,,"Arsanjani, A., Zhang, L.-J., Ellis, M., Allam, A., Channabasavaiah, K., S3: A service-oriented reference architecture (2007) IT professional, 9 (3), pp. 10-17; Grimshaw, J., McAuley, L.M., Bero, L.A., Grilli, R., Oxman, A.D., Ramsay, C., Vale, L., Zwarenstein, M., Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of quality improvement strategies and programmes (2003) Quality and safety in health care, 12 (4), pp. 298-303; De Oliveira, L.B.R., Felizardo, K.R., Feitosa, D., Nakagawa, E.Y., Reference models and reference architectures based on service-oriented architecture: a systematic review (2010) Software Architecture, pp. 360-367. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Dyba, T., Dingsoyr, T., Hanssen, G.K., Applying systematic reviews to diverse study types: An experience report (2007) Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, pp. 225-234. , ESEM, First International Symposium on IEEE; Frunza, O., Inkpen, D., Matwin, S., Klement, W., O'blenis, P., Exploiting the systematic review protocol for classification of medical abstracts (2011) Artificial intelligence in medicine, 51 (1), pp. 17-25; Gu, Q., Lago, P., A model for exploring the service-oriented software engineering (sose) challenge (2007) 2nd European young researchers workshop on service oriented computing (YRSOC), pp. 44-49; Gu, Q., Lago, P., Exploring service-oriented system engineering challenges: a systematic literature review (2009) Service Oriented Computing and Applications, 3 (3), pp. 171-188; Keele, S., Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering (2007) Technical report, , EBSE Technical Report EBSE-2007-01; Kitchenham, B., Procedures for performing systematic reviews (2004) Keele, UK, Keele University, 33, pp. 1-26; Li, Z., Zhang, H., O'Brien, L., Facing service-oriented system engineering challenges: an organizational perspective (2010) Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA), 2010 IEEE International Conference on IEEE, pp. 1-4; Stevenson, A., Waite, M., Concise Oxford English Dictionary: Book & CD-ROM Set (2011), Oxford University Press; Letchmunan, S., Pragmatic Cost Estimation for Web Applications (2012), PhD diss., University of Strathclyde; Kitchenham, B.A., Mendes, E., Travassos, G.H., Cross versus within-company cost estimation studies: A systematic review (2007) Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 33 (5), pp. 316-329; William, M.K., Measurement Validity Types (2008) Retrieved from Research methods knowledge base, , http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/measval.php; Swientek, M., Bleimann, U., Dowland, P.S., Service-Oriented Architecture: Performance Issues and Approaches (2008) Proceedings of the Seventh International Network Conference INCcLulu.com, p. 261; Roshen, W., SOA-Based Enterprise Integration (2009) A step-by-step guide to service-based application integration, , USA: The McGrawHill",,,,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,,,,,17389984,,,,English,Int.

These provided evidence of the strength of agile methodologies as a strategy that can speed up the development of rhythms and growth of innovation. Managing a project involves a complexity of requirements and developmental processes. This provides challenges to the project manager as he is accountable for the failure of a completed project. As such he is required to tackle any problems by adopting agile methodology during the development process. In Malaysia there is little research done to examine the behavior of the agile project manager. This study aims to analyze the behavior when project managers adopt agile in managing the development projects. Moreover, a review of the relevant literature has helped in developing an understanding of the agile project manager's behavior as this is necessary for them to become more agile inside development projects. For that reason, this paper has identified seven behaviors that the manager needs to adopt during software development process. These include Leadership, Openness, Results Orientation, Ethics, Communication, Strategic and Creative and Innovative. This paper contributes to the relevant theory by developing taxonomy of the agile project manager's behavior. Practitioners can use this taxonomy as a sensitizing device that helps the manager to consider behavior that promotes success of their projects. This is important to ensure an increase productivity and profitability, which are the business strategies of software development projects. © 2014 IEEE.",agile behavior; agile methodologies; agile project manager; communication; creative; ethics; innovative; leadership; openness; result orientation; strategic,Communication; Managers; Philosophical aspects; Planning; Software design; Software engineering; Taxonomies; agile behavior; Agile Methodologies; creative; ethics; innovative; leadership; openness; Project managers; strategic; Project management,,,,,,,"Augustine, B.S., Payne, B., Sencindiver, F., (2005) ManagementD : Steering, 48 (12), pp. 85-89; Attarzadeh, I., Siew Hock, O., Modern project management d: Essential skills and techniques (2008) Commun.

Most available models try to predict availability of a software during its life cycle but there are very few or no models that predict a software going days without a failure. Over the years, decision tree model have been used as a reliable technique for prediction. In this study, based on the sample data collected by John Musa of Bell Telephone Laboratories, a decision tree model has been used to predict the availability of a system going days without a failure.
