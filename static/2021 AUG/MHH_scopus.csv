Many studies have offered important insights into this model. Nevertheless, regarding the e-learning body of knowledge, D&#x0026;M research remains to be systematically reviewed comprehensively. E-learning refers to the use of information technology to disseminate knowledge for education and training. With today&#x2019;s e-learning boom necessitated for the most part by COVID-19, its adoption has become increasingly mandatory. Thus, a systematic review should help focus and accelerate future research. This study systematically reviews, compiles, analyzes, and synthesizes the D&#x0026;M model studies in the e-learning context. This review adopts automatic and manual search methods to collect related studies from 2010 to 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 92 primary studies are identified. The findings show that most of reviewed studies were conducted in the education field. The success category was the most highly investigated area from among the selected studies. Most studies developed a hybrid/extended model. Additionally, this study also identified gaps in the literature and recommends seven potential future areas requiring further investigation, such as conducting studies to examine the net benefits at the organizational level of analysis. To that end, the findings of this systematic review study provide an impactful contribution through offering a holistic review of the current state of D&#x0026;M model studies in an e-learning context, providing an essential reference for scholars in this field.

Even though the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled companies to anchorage business returns, most Indonesian MSMEs are highly susceptible to failure and one of the main issues is the inability to manage their financials effectively. The literature on accounting points out that the success of MSMEs owing to the usage of cloud-based Accounting Information Systems (AIS) or Cloud Accounting (CA) could reduce the rate of failure by managing multiple accounting information at a low cost. Although many benefits exist, Indonesian MSMEs are not adopting these platforms in their daily business activities. This study investigates the factors that influence Indonesian MSMEs’ intention to adopt CA. The study is directed by unstructured in-depth interviews with seven bestseller MSMEs where a thematic analysis technique was employed to identify them. The interview findings and prevailing literature on the influencing factors based on the TOE (technological, organizational, and environmental) framework to adopt CA in Indonesian MSMEs context are perceived benefits outweighing the cost, perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, owner-manager knowledge on accounting, organization size, competitive pressure, and informal network. The conceptual model further includes government intervention as a moderator in the model. ©Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Cloud Accounting; Government Intervention; Indonesian MSMEs; Intention to Adopt; TOE Framework,,,,,,,,,"Abdul Hameed, M., Counsell, S., Assessing the influence of environmental and CEO characteristics for adoption of information technology in organizations (2012) Journal of Technology Management & Innovation, 7 (1), pp. 64-84; Adiyasa, H., Hidayanto, A.

This is one of the early attempts to explicate and describe the patterns of published articles of PEB in the field of Computer Science. From the first article traced in 1976 until 2019, the total numbers of published documents related to pro-environmental behaviour across all disciplines are 2276. However, only 97 documents were found in the field of Computer Science. It is noted that the integration of PEB in Computer Science has indicated an exponential increase in annual publication rate and this trend appears to be evident in developed countries. Specifically, the analysis of productivity according to country/region, institution and funding sponsor suggested that the research landscapes in particularly in Malaysia are paying attention to the intersection of PEB and Computer Sciences. The exploration in the type of publication, source of publication, keyword and language analysis provided the orientation, status and trends of the topic and potential hints to future studies in this field. Overall, progressive trends in publications suggest that the integration of the topic would be continuously published and studied in Malaysia as well as among the international community. © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",Behavioural; Bibliometric; Scopus; Sustainability; Trends,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

For almost a century since the white cane was first introduced, the cane has remained as the most reliable tool for those affected by blindness. Methods: By using a combination of the capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) and existing devices, such as mobile phones, an InWalker system is proposed to expand the functionality of the typical white cane, so as to introduce several new features that enhance the safety and confidence amongst people who are blind. As such, this paper explores the existing works and projects to comprehend the motivation and the standard practices for each proposed feature. Each of the strength and drawback has been assessed thoroughly to refine the scope of this project. Results: The proposed project, InWalker, is an intelligent system that has an embedded board system with various sensors to enhance the usability of white cane. The inputs from the sensor are processed on a microcontroller, which then pass the data to a smartphone via Bluetooth for additional features, such as global positioning system (GPS) tracking and SMS services. Conclusions: Based on the initial user testing, the proposed system has successfully fulfilled most of the users’ need.Implication for Rehabilitation Visual impairment is a disability more commonly caused by diseases that lead to several disadvantages amongst those blind. The white cane has been seen as the most reliable tool for the visual impaired. This tool could be further improved with the integration of additional sensors that works with today’s mobile devices. The proposed system, InWalker, is able to improve the overall quality of life among people who are blind through several features: obstacle detection, GPS tracking and a light illumination in dark environments for increased safety. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",embedded board system; Internet of Things; Smart white cane; visual impairment,cane; devices; equipment design; geographic information system; human; rehabilitation; self help device; smartphone; text messaging; visually impaired person; Canes; Equipment Design; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Self-Help Devices; Smartphone; Text Messaging; Visually Impaired Persons,,,,,,,,"(2017), http://www.who.int, World Health Organization;, [Online]; [cited 2017 Sep 20].

Regrettably, most universities and establishments in developing countries and beyond do not have learning contents that are compatible with the mobile devices. This makes the development of mobile learning contents difficult and therefore the practice of reusing online Learning Objects (LO), is generally employed to make the development of the mobile learning contents much easier. The major issues encountered with semantic web at times of processing RLO, are that first, not all online LO are accessible on mobile devices, subsequently the LO metadata are not readily available. The Mobile Learning Objects Compilation Framework (MLOC) which is a mixture framework of random forest and semantic web is proposed by this study to address these problems. The hybrid framework would include a method that will generate RLO metadata from repositories and use those metadata to evaluate the RLO. The assembled related RLO are made available to these learning contents to other systems through the web services so that mobile apps can access the RLO easily. This research therefore examines the methods to enhance semantic web in the reuse of LO for mobile devices. The research will first introduce a method to generate learning metadata from public search results based on learning theories. Thereafter, establish the semantic methods to evaluate the RLO and assemble RLO into complete learning units in a repository that can be accessed by mobile devices without hitches The projected framework would be able to search and extract the RLOs which are much more effectual compared to RLOs retrieved by other related mobile apps which in turn confirms that MLOC can be used to process RLOs for mobile devices. © 2020 SERSC.",Lecturers; MLOC; Mobile Learning; RLO,,,,,,,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education Under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) 2018, with account number 203.PKOMP.6711580.",,"Allen, M.W., Michael Allen's guide to e-learning: Building interactive, fun (2016) And Effective Learning Programs for Any Company: John Wiley & Sons; Bhalalusesa, R.P., Arshad, M.R.M., (2014) Using Search Results Metadata to Discover Effective Learning Objects for Mobile Devices, , Paper presented at the Proceedings of the First International Conference on Advanced Data and Information Engineering (DaEng-2013); Cardinaels, K., (2007) A Dynamic Learning Object Life Cycle and Its Implications for Automatic Metadata Generation; Caruana, R., Niculescu-Mizil, A., An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms (2006) Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 23Rd International Conference on Machine Learning; Csete, J., Wong, Y.-H., Vogel, D., (2004) Mobile Devices in and out of the Classroom.

The successful implementation of Big Data projects depends on their alignment with the current organizational, technological, and analytical aspects. Identifying the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Big Data is fundamental to overcome the challenges surrounding Big Data Analytics (BDA) and implementation. In recent years, the investigations related to identifying the CSFs of Big Data and Big Data Analytics expanded on a large scale trying to address the limitations in existing publications and contribute to the body of knowledge. This paper aims to provide more understanding about the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics and implementation and contributes to the body of knowledge by answering three research questions: 1) How many studies have investigated on Big Data CSFs for analytics and implementation?, 2) What are the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics, and 3) What are the categories of Big Data Analytics CSFs?. By conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for the available studies related to Big Data CSFs in the last twelve years (2007-2019), a final list of sixteen (16) related articles was extracted and analyzed to identify the Big Data Analytics CSFs and their categories. Based on the descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the selected literature, this SLR paper identifies 74 CSFs for Big Data and proposes a classification schema and framework in terms of 5 categories, namely Organization, Technology, People, Data Management, and Governance. The findings of this paper could be used as a referential framework for a successful strategy and implementation of Big Data by formulating more effective data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the priority of the Big Data CSFs and their categories toward developing a conceptual framework for assessing the success of Big Data projects. © 2013 IEEE.",Big data (BD); big data analytics (BDA); big data challenges; big data implementation; critical success factors (CSFs); information system success; maturity; readiness; systematic literature review (SLR),Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Information management; Metadata; Conceptual frameworks; Content analysis method; Critical success factor; Data driven decision; Digital transformation; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Advanced Analytics,,,,,,,,"Jin, X., Wah, B.W., Cheng, X., Wang, Y., Significance and challenges of big data research (2015) Big Data Res., 2 (2), pp. 59-64. , Jun; Tsai, C.-W., Lai, C.-F., Chao, H.-C., Vasilakos, A.V., Big data analytics: A survey (2015) J.

Most of the existing organizations have taken these benefits to actively engage with the public to increase their online business value. The use of hashtags on numerous social media platforms especially on Instagram is one of the highly used benefits. By tagging specific postings, business organizations are able to promote and communicate with their customers directly in a more interactive manner. In this article, the authors are exploring the following: (1) to determine the effectiveness of the existing analytics method (text identification and trend analysis) for analyzing Instagram hashtag data and; (2) to determine the effectiveness of existing analytic techniques such as Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) suited for the selected analytics method.

The ability to be successful in Big Data is related to the maturity level of the organization. A Maturity Model (MM) is a tool that can be applied to assess the 'As-is' situation regarding specific key dimensions, where the maturity levels indicate an organization's current capabilities and the desirable state. Most of the available literature on the Maturity Models for Big Data is still in white papers, reports, and internet materials from developers' websites. The existing literature might not have covered all the available Maturity Models for Big Data. This paper reviewed the existing literature to achieve three objectives: first, to provide a comprehensive overview about the Maturity, Maturity Model, Capability Maturity Model, and the Maturity Model for Big Data; second, to identify the existing Big Data Maturity Models and to summarize the most used models; third, to highlight the limitations of the existing Big Data Maturity Models. © 2019 IEEE.",Big Data; Big Data Maturity Model; Capability Maturity Model; Capability Maturity Model Integration; Maturity; Maturity Model,Economics; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; Capability maturity models; Data maturity; Maturity; Maturity model; Big data,,,,,,,,"Chen, M., Mao, S., Liu, Y., Big data: A survey (2014) Mob.

Big Data comes to life with insights to improve the technology fashion and lifestyle with calling for readiness to change. Big Data has become a significant factor that could be a material asset for both business and government organizations. As such, it is important to understand the definition of Big Data, their key characteristics, and the challenges surrounding the concept and characteristics. The implementation of Big Data brings new critical challenges that need to be addressed before starting the Big Data journey. The main challenges that are commonly faced by organizations are the implementation of Big Data alongside the critical challenges that involve the challenges related to technology, organization, process, data management, and skills. The challenges are difficult and the growth in terms of Big Data is increasing exponentially which calls for further investigation. This paper reviewed the existing literature on Big Data to achieve three objectives: first, to highlight the definitions and characteristics of Big Data and to summarize the most common definitions of existing works; second, to identify the impacts and the opportunities for the Big Data; third, to present and identify the main critical challenges related to Big Data and categorize these challenges as (People, Technology, Organization, Process, and Data management) challenges. © 2019 IEEE.",Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Big Data Challenges; Big Data Characteristics; Critical Success Factors; Data Management,Data Analytics; Information management; Business partners; Critical challenges; Critical success factor; Data challenges; Data characteristics; Data impact; Government organizations; Key characteristics; Big data,,,,,,,,"Manyika, J., Big data: The next frontier for innovation , competition , and productivity (2011) McKinsey Glob.

The methodology employs the practices of continuous integration and delivery and places the deployment pipeline as the main requirement to automate, deliver and operate software in a robust way, without compromising on the quality in the software development process. Over time, many systems and tools have been developed to implement the deployment pipeline and support the continuous delivery process. A pipeline splits the process of software delivery into various stages. Each stage is designed to verify the quality of new features from a new perspective to attest to the functionality and prevent either small or big errors from impacting the end users. The pipeline must provide a response and feedback loop to the concerned team and provide a window into the flow of changes that takes place. However, there is no clear rule to define what goes into a pipeline. This paper reviews the challenges of quality assurance of DevOps and provides tentative recommendations to deal with quality issues. Our proposed pipeline with analytic features is expected to provide accurate metrics on a real-time basis. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Continuous delivery; Continuous deployment; Continuous integration; Deployment pipeline; DevOps; Devops analytics; Quality assurance,Application programs; Continuous time systems; Quality assurance; Software design; Continuous delivery; Continuous deployment; Continuous integrations; DevOps; Devops analytics; Pipelines,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304.PKOMP.6316282",The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia Bridging Research Grant Scheme (304.PKOMP.6316282) for the financial support.,,"Chakraborty, A., Ramachandran, K.K., Yamijala, S.S.R.K.C., Pati, S.K., Maji, T.K., A hexanuclear Cu(i) cluster supported by cuprophilic interaction: Effects of aromatics on luminescence properties (2014) RSC Adv, 4 (66), pp. 35167-35170; Shahin, M., Zahedi, M., Ali Babar, M., Zhu, L., Babar, M.A., Zhu, L., (2018) An Empirical Study of Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Deployment, , Springer; Perera, P., Silva, R., Perera, I., Improve software quality through practicing DevOps (2018) 17th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions, ICTer 2017 - Proceedings, 2018, pp. 13-18. , Janua; Qumer Gill, A., Loumish, A., Riyat, I., Han, S., Devops for information management (2018) VINE J.

The key issue in testing is determining the sufficiency of tests and, traditionally this has been done by using the Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs). However, SRGMs are not applicable when there are no stabilization phases as required by most software reliability models. Test-Defect Coverage Analytics Model (TDCAM) has been proposed to address this problem. This paper proposes the application of visual analytic techniques as an approach for supporting informed decision making in deciding the sufficiency of tests. Visual analytics research considers interactive visualization as the common platform for combining various computational data analysis techniques to support the analytical reasoning process. We presented four visual representations of TDCAM to demonstrate how analytical models have been applied to indicate the adequacy of tests in relation to sufficient and efficient test coverage. The techniques provide an effective and generally applicable test estimation on the basis of a general trend that higher test coverage correlates with higher probability of detecting more defects. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Software reliability; Software testing; Software visualization; Test analytics; Visual analytics,Application programs; Data visualization; Decision making; Software reliability; Testing; Visualization; Analytic technique; Analytical reasoning; Interactive visualizations; Software reliability growth models; Software reliability models; Software visualization; Visual analytics; Visual representations; Software testing,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304.PKOMP.6316282",The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia Bridging Research Grant Scheme (304.PKOMP.6316282) for the financial support.

Hardcopy documents has been one of the items that most organizations need to manage in a safe and secure manner due to the high dependency on most of their working procedure especially in government organizations. Hence, we proposed a new framework to improve the weaknesses of the existing document management procedures in government organizations. Our proposed framework integrates the implementation of an NFC system in this research due to its secure short - range communication, and the peer-to-peer communication capability in most mobile devices. Besides that, most existing government organizations within Malaysia could easily implement such technology for their internal usage as this technology is cost effective due to its availability on existing mobile devices on most Android based devices. © 2018, Siti Salbiah Zainal Abidin and Mohd Heikal Husin.",Accessibility; Document management system; Malaysian e-government; NFC; Security,,,,,,,,,"AlMahafzah, H., Zaid AlRwashdeh, M., (2012) A survey of multibiometric systems, , arXiv preprint; Baidya, J., (2017) Design and implementation of a fingerprint based lock system for shared access, Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), pp. 1-6. , et al., IEEE 7th Annual (IEEE), 2017; (2018) Sustainable Open Innovation in Government: Practical Application in Cities and Beyond, , http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2016/05/02/sustainable-open-innovation-in-government-practical-application-in-cities-and-beyond, <>, accessed, 02nd February 2018; Bernama, (2018) Government is citizens’ true partner, Ali Hamsa says’, , The Malay Mail Online; Ashraf Chattha, N., NFC—Vulnerabilities and defense (2014) 2014 Conference on Information Assurance and Cyber Security (CIACS), pp. 35-38. , in:, IEEE; Henry, C., Vanhaverbeke, W., West, J., (2006) Open innovation: researching a new paradigm, , Oxford University Press on Demand; Collins, (2018) Definition of ‘security’, , https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/security, <>, accessed, 01st February 2018; (2017) Symantec Web and Cloud Security, , https://www.symantec.com/products/web-and-cloud-security, <>, accessed; Cullen, J., Peairs, M., (1999) Document management system, , Google Patents; Dixon, E., (2015) Biometric access – enabling patrons to log in and check out with a swipe of the finger’, , American Libraries Magazine; Duarte, T., (2016) Biometric access control systems: a review on technologies to improve their efficiency, Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC), pp. 795-800. , et al., 2016 IEEE International (IEEE; (2017) Economic Planning Unit, Prime Minister’s Department, , http://www.epu.gov.my/en/profile/vission, <>, Vision: Mission & Objectives, accessed; Ministry of Higher Education, egBiometric, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, , http://www.etanah.gov.my/etanah, <>, accessed; Nick, W., Shelton, J., Sabol, C., Esterline, A., (2017) Federated protocol for biometric authentication and access control, pp. 854-862. , 2017 Computing Conference; Eun, H., Lee, H., Oh, H., Conditional privacy preserving security protocol for NFC applications (2013) IEEE Trans.

The existing OPAC platform acts as a search engine for reading materials in the library is commonly complicated and not user friendly. The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is introduced in this project as part of a mobile application. NFC is a set of protocols on portable devices which perform wireless and contact-less short range, two-way communication between compatible devices. Transmission of data between devices is completed over radio waves and magnetic induction with passive NFC devices. As mobile devices, especially smartphones are more commonly utilized by users all around the world including university students, the proposed system would be able to enhance the performance of a library to be more convenient, secure, and more user friendly. Indirectly, the development of this mobile application can improve the visitation rates of students to the library by simplifying the searching, tracking reading materials and borrowing activities. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.",Android-based application; Library system; Mobile application; NFC technology; Smart university,Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio transmission; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Library systems; Mobile applications; Nfc technologies; Smart universities; The near field communication (NFC); Transmission of data; Two way communications; University students; Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Villen-Rueda, L., Senso, J.A., De Moya-Anegón, F., The use of OPAC in a large academic library: A transactional log analysis study of subject searching (2007) J Acad Librarianship, 33 (3), pp. 327-337; Arshad, A., Shafique, F., What do users prefer, card catalogue or OPAC?

As such, air travellers often face some form of issues before or after their flights. Those issues include not having the printed boarding pass on hand when they reach the airport, facing difficulties to look for flight information displays at the airport, waiting in long queues before using the airport transports and do not know the latest situation at the airport before going there. These issues may bring some negative consequences to the air travellers. Hence, an Android based mobile application called 'Smart Flyers' has been developed to help air travellers to overcome the issues stated above. In this mobile application, there are four main functionalities, which are flight boarding pass functionality, flight information functionality, airport transport booking functionality and the social aspect functionality. For this mobile application, the programming language used are Android Java Programming Language, Hypertext Pre-processor (PHP) and Structured Query Language (SQL) whereas the development software used are Android Studio and Notepad++. In short, the goal of Smart Flyers mobile application is to bring convenience to the air travellers by helping them to mitigate the issues that they face before or after their flight. © 2017 IEEE.",air travellers; airport transport; boarding pass; flight information; flyers zone; information news and updates; smart flyers mobile application,Air transportation; Airports; Android (operating system); Computer programming languages; Hypertext systems; Mobile computing; Query languages; Social aspects; Air travellers; Boarding pass; Flight information; information news and updates; Mobile applications; Application programs,,,,,,,,"Air Transport, Passengers Carried, , http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR, International Civil Aviation Organization [Online]; Magrath, A., (2014) A Third of Passengers Have Switched to Digital Airport Check in As Half Are Stung Up by Up to £70 Fees for Lost Boarding Pass, , http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel-news/article-2779108/Apassengers-switched-digital-Airport-check-HALF-stung-70-fees-lostboarding-passes.html, October 3).

Various studies conducted in other countries have found social media activities has increased especially among the younger generation. As such, the potential online risks on these platforms especially among children has become crucial as the platform usage increases each year. Such situation is also found to be common in different Asian countries especially Malaysia. In this research, a survey was conducted among children between the ages of 7 to 12 years old to identify relevant online activities that increases potential online risks on social media platforms. Based on previous research, three categories of online risks were used to develop the survey scenarios and respondents were required to provide their answers based on them. From the results, it was found that online activities such as photo or video uploads, online video watching, online chatting and commenting on social networking sites could lead to increased potential risks. These online activities influence the risks that is categorized into content, private and contact. © 2017 IEEE.",children; online contact risks; online content risks; online private risks; social media,Risk perception; Surveys; children; On-line contents; Online activities; Online social medias; Social media; Social media platforms; Social networking sites; Younger generations; Social networking (online),,,,,,,,"Shami, N., Lupushor, S., Geyer, W., Guy, I., Ferrar, J., Yang, J., Panc, L., Soule, T., Understanding employee social media chatter with enterprise social pulse (2014) Proc. 17th ACM Conf.

The results are compared to a similar research conducted in Singapore. The motivation and benefits derived from this research can be used to improve the overall quality of services provided by MyEG and to enhance the efficiency as well as accountability of this e-government service. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted by applying a theoretical framework known as technology acceptance model involving several factors such as intention to use, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, image, compatibility and trust. The research data were then validated by examining similar factors that had significance results, followed by the development of a simple prototype. Findings: The results obtained from this research would be beneficial to enhance the level of adoption among the citizens in Malaysia. The identification of the different factors influencing the acceptance levels of users can also provide a better vision on the end-user perspective for MyEG developers and lead them to achieve better results in future platform developments. In addition, this study also fills the current existing gap in e-government research of Malaysia and contributes to the literature on the public users’ perspective of e-government services. Practical implications: The results from this research would provide effective guidance to developers of e-government platforms to include specific criteria that would attract the general public in using the platforms. Social implications: Besides that, it provides a new perspective from the general public on their interest to use any e-government platform specifically MyEG. Originality/value: The findings of this research would assist in the improvement of the implementation and adoption of the current MyEG system. Besides that, this research will allow researchers to gain new insights about e-government services and apply the knowledge to further improve the current and other platform development. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Electronic government;

However, issue arises when cyberbullies are able to reach their victims through these social media platforms. There are different types of cyberbullying and like traditional bullying; it causes victims to feel overly selfconscious, increases their tendency to self-harm and generally affects their mental state negatively. Such situations occur due to security issues such as user anonymity and the lack of content restrictions in some social networks or web forums. In this paper, we highlight the existing solutions, which are Intrusion Prevention System and Intrusion Detection System from a number of researchers. However, even with such solutions, cyberbullying acts still occurs at an alarming rate. As such, we proposed an alternative solution that aims to prevent cyberbullying activities at a younger age, e.g., young children. The application would provide an alternative method to preventing cyberbullying activities among the younger generations in the future. © 2017 KIPS.",Cyberbullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion detection system; Mobile application; Social network,Computer crime; Mercury (metal); Social networking (online); Alternative solutions; Cyber bullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion prevention systems; Mobile applications; Social media platforms; Younger generations; Intrusion detection,,,,,,,,"Hanna, R., Rohm, A., Crittenden, V.L., ""We're all connected: the power of the social media ecosystem,"" (2011) Business Horizons, 54 (3), pp. 265-273; Wall, D.S., (2007) Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, , Cambridge, MA: Polity Press; Hinduja, S., Patchin, J.W., ""Bullying, cyberbullying, and suicide,"" (2010) Archives of Suicide Research, 14 (3), pp. 206-221; Patchin, J.W., Hinduja, S., (2012) Cyberbullying Prevention and Response: Expert Perspectives, , New York, NY: Routledge; Ribble, M., (2011) Digital Citizenship in Schools, , 2nd ed.

As a result, more and more users are utilizing such platforms to share their ideas and opinions to a wider audience. Young children who represents the new generation are also relying on this platform for many of their needs. Our research which was conducted among Malaysian children has found that such reliance is quite evident as well. As this need increases, the exposure to issues such as cyberbullying also increases. A survey was conducted among children from 9 to 12 years old in order to identify such reliance. The objective of this study is to identify the existing level of social media usages among Malaysian children. From the initial results, media sharing and social networking has become the most popular sites among the children. This indicates that further exploration into the usage trends among children as social media platforms becomes more utilized by the younger generation. © 2016 IEEE.",Children; Initial perspective; Social media; Web usage,Information science; Children; Cyber bullying; Initial perspective; Social media; Social media platforms; User-generated content; Web usage; Younger generations; Social networking (online),,,,,,,,"Leiner, B., Cerf, V., Clark, D., Kahn, R., Kleinrock, L., Lynch, D., Postel, J., Wolff, S., A brief history of the internet (2009) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 39 (5), pp. 22-31; O'Reilly, T., What is web 2.0: Design patterns and business models for the next generation of software (2007) Communications & Strategies, (1), p. 17; Bowe, B.J., Wohn, D.Y., Are there generational differences?

The organisations should be aware of a number of issues when implementing Web 2.0 internally. This paper introduces a theoretical model that highlights the importance of management, technology and people issues influencing the level of Web 2.0 usage from an internal perspective. The purpose of this paper was to identify and explore these issues in a government context. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative) analysis to identify the issues that should be focused on for achieving effective usage of Web 2.0 among government employees. A combination of interviews, surveys and usage data collected from two government organisations was used to gather the data. Findings – The main finding is that, a policy will act as an initial catalyst for culture change and effective usage of Web 2.0 technologies in a government environment. It was also found that it is important to develop an understanding among senior management about the motivation for their employees to utilise Web 2.0 internally. As a result, the proposed theoretical model could assist government organisations in developing effective adoption approaches through identifying their employees’ motivation to adopt Web 2.0 technologies and developing a suitable organisational social media policy. Research limitations/implications – There is the issue of the small number of both qualitative and quantitative respondents within the research. Such limitation is because the research relies solely on the voluntary participation of the employees. This limitation was coupled with the fact that both organisations had different security requirements that had affected the amount and level of feasible information that was accessible to the researchers. Practical implications – This paper extends the understanding of issues applicable to the adoption of Web 2.0 tools from a government organisations’ perspective. The developed theoretical model acts as an adoption guide for organisations to achieve effective Web2.0 tools usage. At the same time, this paper also examines related motivation aspects which higher management should consider while using a new social media or Web 2.0 platform internally. Originality/value – This paper highlights suitable overview approaches for organisations to consider in increasing adoption of Web 2.0 among their employees. This paper also provides an initial foray into identifying other complex issues that may exist within different government organisations in relation to internal technology usage. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Employee motivation; Government 2.0; Internal usage; Policy development; Risk mitigation,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., (2012) Understanding Organizational Culture, , Sage Publications, New York, NY:; Arasanmi, C., Wang, W.Y.C., Singh, H., Ekundayo, S., (2011) What motivates end-users to transfer gained knowledge from enterprise systems training?, , ), “”, Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS) 2011, AUT University; Auerbach, C.F., Silverstein, L.B., (2003) Qualitative Data: An Introduction to Coding and Analysis, , Illustrated ed., New York University Press, New York, NY:; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: e-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies (2010) Government Information Quarterly, 27 (3-7), pp. 264-271. , ), “”; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Promoting transparency and accountability through ICTs, social media, and collaborative e-government (2012) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 6 (1), pp. 78-91. , ), “”; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Hansen, D., The impact of policies on government social media usage: issues, challenges, and recommendations (2012) Government Information Quarterly, 29 (1), pp. 30-40. , ), “”; Carter, L., Bélanger, F., The utilization of e-government services: citizen trust, innovation and acceptance factors* (2005) Information Systems Journal, 15 (1), pp. 5-25. , ), “”; Creswell, J.W., (2009) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, , 3 ed., Sage Publication, Thous Oaks, CA:; Dadashzadeh, M., Social media in government: from egovernment to egovernance (2010) Journal of Business & Economic Research, 8 (11), pp. 81-86. , ), “”; Dasgupta, S., Gupta, B., Dwivedi, Y.K., Henriksen, H.Z., Wastell, D., De, R., Organization culture dimensions as antecedents of internet technology adoption (2013) Grand Successes and Failures in IT.

Commonly, users utilize the technology to track the position of a vehicle or an object of interest. They also use it to safely navigate to the destination of their choice. As a result, there are countless number of GPS based tracking application that has been developed. But, a main recurring issue that exists among these applications are the inaccuracy of the tracking faced by users and this issue has become a rising concern. Most existing research have examined the effects that the inaccuracy of GPS have on users while others identified suitable methods to improve the accuracy of GPS based on one or two factors. The objective of this survey paper is to identify the common factors that affects the accuracy of GPS and identify an effective method which could mitigate or overcome most of those factors. As part of our research, we conducted a thorough examination of the existing factors for GPS inaccuracies. According to an initial survey that we have collected, most of the respondents has faced some form of GPS inaccuracy. Among the common issues faced are inaccurate object tracking and disconnection of GPS signal while using an application. As such, most of the respondents agree that it is necessary to improve the accuracy of GPS. This leads to another objective of this paper, which is to examine and evaluate existing methods as well as to identify the most effective method that could improve the accuracy of GPS. © 2016, Academy and Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC).",Accuracy factors; Global positioning system; GPS; Improve accuracy,,,,,,,,,"Lin, J.Y., Yang, B.K., Tuan, A.D., Chen, H.C., The Accuracy Enhancement of GPS Track in Google Map (2013) 2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, pp. 524-527. , Communication and Applications, Compiegne, France; Iqbal, A., Mahmood, H., Farooq, U., Kabir, M.A., Asad, M.U., An Overview of the Factors Responsible for GPS Signal Error: Origin and Solution (2009), pp. 294-299. , 2009 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Information Systems, Shanghai, China; Bajaj, R., Ranaweera, S.L., Agrawal, D.P., GPS: Location-tracking Technology Computer, 35 (4), pp. 92-94; Huang, J.Y., Tsai, C.H., Improve GPS Positioning Accuracy with Context Awareness (2008), pp. 94-99. , 2008 First IEEE International Conference on Ubi-Media Computing, Lanzhou, China; Wubbena, G., Andreas, B., Seeber, G., Boder, V., Hankemeier, P., Reducing Distance Dependant Errors for Real-Time Precise DGPS Applications by Establishing Reference Station Networks (1996) Proceedings of the 9th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GPS-96); Enge, P., Walter, T., Pullen, S., Kee, C., Chao, Y., Tsai, Y., Wide area augmentation of the global positioning system (1996) Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 1063-1088. , 84 Aug. 1996; Qi, H., Moore, J.B., Direct Kalman Filtering Approach for GPS/INS Integration (2002) IEEE Trans.

Age society often suffers from common problems such as Alzheimer's disease that disrupts their daily life. Moreover, it restricted their activity area, safety and freedom in their daily life. Hence, a tracking system is good for their relatives or guardian to track their location and path. When the population of aged society increases and the number of elders being lost increases, current tracking and monitoring systems are unable to satisfy the needs of the community. Hence, a smart tracking and monitoring system that automatically tracks and monitor these elderly person is required. INdoor-OuTdoor Elderly CAring SystEm (NOTECASE) is a real-time tracking and monitoring system that utilizes the RFID, Wi-Fi, and Global Location Positioning System (GPS) aim to track and monitor the aged society, both within indoors and outdoors environment. A mobile and web-based application is developed and the architecture of the whole implementation is presented.

Existing researches have shown that new systems require novice users to spend an amount of time to get to know the technology. Near Field Communication (NFC) is an emerging technology, which offers an enhanced interaction for users by simplifying data transfers, secured payment transaction access and many more. In this paper, we looked into a number of widely used acceptance models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory Planned Behavior (TPB) and, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to identify the theory that is best suited as an assessment tool of the user acceptance to the NFC technology. We have identified UTAUT as the best tool based on literature and utilized the theory to develop a questionnaire for the user acceptance survey. Our results indicates, factors such as social influence and facilitating condition affected the users' technology acceptance for NFC where most respondents are willing to use the technology if they had the chance to do so. © 2015 IEEE.",Near Field Communication; Technology Acceptance Model; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology,Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Industrial management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Surveys; Emerging technologies; Facilitating conditions; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; The near field communication (NFC); The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Theory of reasoned action; Unified theory; Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Steffen, R., Preiinger, J., Schöllermann, T., Müller, A., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an automative environent (2010) Second International Workshop on Near Field Communication, pp. 15-20. , April; Dillon, A., Morris, M., User acceptance of information and technology: Theories and models (1996) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 31, pp. 3-32; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340; Venkatesh, V., Davis, F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) Management Science, 2, pp. 186-204. , February; Venkatesh, V., Creation of favorable user perceptions: Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation (1999) MIS Quarterly, 2, pp. 239-260. , June; Venkatesh, V., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 425-478. , September; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Believe, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior:An Introduction to Theory and Research, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Au, S., Parameswaran, N., Problem solving with attitude and the theory of reasoned action (2003) IEEE/WIC International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology IEEE, pp. 1-4. , October; Teh, P., Ahmed, P.K., MOA and TRA in social Commerce: An intergrated model (2011) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management Singapore IEEE, pp. 1375-1378. , December; Sogani, S., Muduganti, R., Hexmoor, H., Davis, F., Introducing agent based implementation of the theory of reasoned action: A case study in user acceptance of computer technology (2005) KIMAS International Conference IEEE, pp. 507-510. , April; Ajzen, I., (2006) Constructing A Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire, pp. 1-12. , http://people.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.measurement.pdf; Lin, T.C., Hsu, M.H., Kuo, F.Y., Sun, P.C., An intention Model-based study of software piracy (1999) 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences IEEE, , January; Lu, Y., Zhou, T., Wang, B., Exploring Chinese user' acceptance of instant messaging using the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, and the flow theory (2009) Computer in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 29-39. , January; Lin, J., Chan, H.C., Wei, K.K., Understanding competing web application platforms : An extended theory of planned behavior and its relative model (2011) Engineering Management, 58. , February; Wu, Y., Tao, Y., Yang, P., Using UTAUT to explore the behavior of3G mobile communication users (2007) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) Singapore IEEE, pp. 209-212. , December; Gao, T., Deng, Y., A study on users' acceptance behavior to mobile E-books application based on UTAUT model (2012) ICSESS3rd International Conference Beijing IEEE, p. 376. , June",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2nd International Symposium on Technology Management and Emerging Technologies, ISTMET 2015",25 August 2015 through 27 August 2015,,118506,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Int.

The inventions of online networks technologies and applications such as social networks rapidly growth the size of digital textual data and indirectly raises the curiosities to mine the juicy information encapsulated in the text data. Researchers have stated that linguistics of the people either in the online or offline having strong correlations with their self-disclosure. The mass creations of digital textual data raised the intentions of scholars to study the hidden abstractions of personality by applying automatic personality detection approaches. Most of the current automatic personality detection studies focused on Big 5 personality model as a framework to study the underlying characteristics of human. As such, this study incorporates the Three Factor Personality (PEN) Model as a personality framework to guide our understanding and revealing the role of words in depicting the characteristics of a user. This preliminary study revealed how the sentiment perceptions of public towards specific words could assist us in detecting the personality of Facebook users by exploiting their status messages. As the first phase of our study, this experiment focuses on gathering the general perceptions of Malaysians towards 52 English words and 17 interjections that was retrieve from the domain stated above. A Likert scale questionnaire executed to find the sentiment valences of 67 words through analyzing responses from participants and statistical significance will assist the categorization of words under PEN traits. The evaluation provides the necessary analysis that could assist our main research that focuses on automatic personality detections specifically on the psychoticism trait. Our initial findings has highlighted that the five words categorized under psychoticism has strong Cronbach's Alpha coefficients and significant effect from multivariate analysis that indirectly affirmed the reliability of the categorization of the words. © 2015 The Authors.",Automatic Personality Perception; Sentiment valence; Three Factor Model,Information systems; Multivariant analysis; Reliability analysis; Social sciences computing; Automatic personality perceptions; Multi variate analysis; On-line social networks; Personality detections; Sentiment valence; Statistical significance; Technologies and applications; Three-factor model; Social networking (online),,,,,,,,"Tolga Aricak, O., Psychiatric Symptomatology as a Predictor of Cyberbullying among University Students (2009) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 34, pp. 167-184. , Winter, 2009; Ellis, (2008) The Study of Personality, , http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/23238_Chapter_1.pdf; Matthews, G., Deary, I., Martha, C., (2003) Personality Traits, , (2nd edition).Cambridge University Press; Kirwan, G., Power, A., (2011) The Psychology of Cyber Crime: Concepts and Principles, , ISR; Rahim Kamaluddin, M., Syariani Md Shariff, N., Othman, A., Hj Ismail, K., Ayu Mat Saat, G., Linking psychological traits with Criminal behavior: A review (2015) Linking Pychological Traits with Criminal Behaviour: A Review ASEAN Journal of Psychiatry, 16 (2). , July - December 2015: XX-XX; Mairesse, F., Using Linguistic Cues for the Automatic Recognition of Personality in Conversation and Text Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30 (2007), pp. 457-500; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings (1999) Technical Report C-1, the Center for Research in Psychophysiology, , University of Florida; Arup Nielsen, F., A new ANEW: Evaluation of a word list for sentiment analysis in microblogs (2011) Proceedings of the ESWC2011 Workshop on 'Making Sense of Microposts': Big Things Come in Small Packages 718 in CEUR Workshop Proceedings, , 93-98. 2011 May; Vasa, R.A., Valence ratings of emotional and non-emotional words in children (2004) Personality and Individual Differences, 41, pp. 1169-1180; Oberlander, J., Nowson, S., Whose thumb is it anyway?

Most of the current research on mobile organizers highlights that most users rely on the application as an effective tool to manage their daily activities especially among university students. A mobile organizer application is software that acts as a personal assistant for users to help them manage their time and activities. From a Malaysian context, the usage of these applications among university students has not been explored in-depth. The aim of this paper is to initially explore the current usage of mobile organizers within a Malaysian university specifically Universiti Sains Malaysia. There are a number of requirements that a mobile organizer application should fulfil, in order to be effective for users. In order to identify these requirements, an initial survey was conducted in order to identify these requirements, which, would then be incorporated into the development of a mobile organizer suitable for Malaysian university students. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Applications; Mobile organizers; Software,,,,,,,,,"Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013-2018 (2014), Cisco VNI Forecast, White paper edn.

However, even with the simplicity and security that the technology provide, the adoption of this technology is not widespread. In this paper, we describe the user-friendliness criteria essential for NFC technology through a proposed library system. To determine the criteria of user-friendliness for the technology, we conducted a survey on the understanding and usage of different users that would be exposed to a library system. The survey included questions about the existing library system (OPAC) and their perception of the NFC technology. Based on the results, we managed to identify that the OPAC system is not a userfriendly library system. Further, we have also identified that there are three main user-friendliness criteria deemed necessary by users for an NFC-enabled library system to be more effective than the OPAC system: usability, security and efficiency. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Near-field communication; OPAC system; Radio frequency identification (RFID),,,,,,,,,"Steffen, R., Preibinger, J., Schollermann, T., Muller, A., Schnabel, I., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an Automotive Environment: Use Cases, Architecture and Realization.

The associated heavier workloads together with tension and pressure often lead to stress-related health problems. People do really deserve a good rest when they come home from their office. As a result, the proposed solution-The Eye 2H is an intelligent system that will use the technique of image processing and face recognition to detect and analyze the human emotion to control the electronic equipment in their house through an intelligent control box. There are several studies highlighted that by controlling the brightness of light, we could affect the emotion or behavior of humans. Thus, we believe that The Eye 2H is capable to fulfill the main objective of the project which is to provide a better living environment for people in order to provide them a harmony and happy (2H) living life. The Eye 2H is capable of boosting the mood and emotion of the residents by controlling the electronic equipment in their house. The feature of turning on light automatically as well as fine-tune the brightness of light according to human emotion mood will give a 'welcoming home' effect to the house owner. Besides that, The Eye 2H is also a green technology project as it will support the Go Green concept by reducing the energy usage. © 2014 IEEE.",automated light control; lighting effects; smart lights; stress,Automation; Electronic equipment; Energy utilization; Houses; Image processing; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Luminance; Man machine systems; Oscillators (electronic); Stresses; Energy usage; Green technology; Human emotion; Increasing costs; Light control; Lighting effects; Living environment; Smart homes; Face recognition,,,,,,,,"Ramos, H., Mustafa, M., Chin, M., The moderating effects of personality on work-family conflicts and stress among Malaysian working parents (2012) International Journal of Management Practice, 5 (3), pp. 225-244; Allen, T.D., Kiburz, K.M., Trait mindfulness and work-family balance among working parents: The mediating effects of vitality and sleep quality (2012) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 80 (2), pp. 372-379; (2011) Harris Interactive: 'Stress in the Workplace, , American Psychological Association; Miller, G.E., Chen, E., Parker, K.J., Psychological stress in childhood and susceptibility to the chronic diseases of aging: Moving toward a model of behavioral and biological mechanisms (2011) Psychological Bulletin, 137 (6), pp. 959-997; Sanders, M.R., Stallman, H.M.M., Workplace Triple P: A controlled evaluation of a parenting intervention for working parents.

It has therefore become essential to develop policies guiding the use of social media within organisations. The need to protect an organisation’s interests by guiding employees’ appropriate use of social media is a key issue for senior managers. This issue has to be balanced against the benefits of empowering employees to make use of social media in flexible, innovative ways. This paper highlights the major components of a social media policy, based on the Social Media and Organisation Policy (SOMEOP) Framework. A method is proposed to enable organisations to effectively evaluate each of the components using a rating system. The framework and rating tool can be used to improve the effectiveness of policy development. A preliminary validation of the instrument indicated that the rating system can assist users with identifying and understanding policy strengths and weaknesses. © 2013 Mohd Heikal Husin, Nina Evans and Gaye Deegan.",Knowledge management; Policy; Policy rating; Social media; Web 2.0,Human resource management; Knowledge management; Public policy; Rating; Social networking (online); Key Issues; Policy development; Public sector; Rating system; Senior managers; Social media; Support knowledge; Web 2.0; Economic and social effects,,,,,,,,"Alexander, P., (2010) Social Media 101: A beginner's guide for Finance employees, , http://agimo.govspace.gov.au/2010/04/07/social-media-101/2010, Retrieved 12 July 2011; Bailey, J.E., Pearson, S.W., Development of a Tool for Measuring and Analyzing Computer User Satisfaction (1983) Management Science, 29, pp. 530-545; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., (2012) Promoting transparency and accountability through ICTs, social media, and collaborative e-government, Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 1 (6), pp. 78-91; David, J., Policy enforcement in the workplace (2002) Computers & Security, 21, pp. 506-513; Inc, D., (2011) Dell's Global Social Media Policy, , http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/social-media-policy.aspx?c=us&l=en, [Online].

Polices are developed and applied to specific areas or applications within the organisation; such that they are sited within an organisational context. Evidence suggests that the development of policies for general employment conditions, (for example, electronic mail usage), tends to be highly structured and provide little flexibility for their implementation. Standard organisational policy development is about applying a set of rules in the workplace. However, when implementing social media in an organisation, the standard policy development processes are not effective in allowing organisations to benefit from the available social media tools. Social media tools have the advantages of offering the organisation flexibility and rapid dispersion of information within the online environment. Hence, organisational policy development for social media usage needs to take these characteristics into account. There is a perceived gap concerning the development of policies for social media usage, as traditional organisational policy development enforces structure and rules that are at odds with the ways social media tools work in the organisation. To fill this gap, we have proposed the Social Media and Organisation Policy (SOMEOP) framework, created to allow organisations to build policies that take specific social media advantages or issues into consideration. By combining key components, such as legal issues, and social media ethics, this framework demonstrates effective and efficient development of social media policy. This paper highlights the processes involved for a public sector entity when developing a social media policy using the SOMEOP framework, and describes the application of the framework within the entity.",Enterprise 2.0; Guidelines; Organisations; Policies; Social media; SOMEOP,Business operation; Employment conditions; Guidelines; Legal issues; Online environments; Organisations; Policy development; Policy development process; Public sector; Set of rules; Social media; SOMEOP; Specific areas; Information systems; Public policy; Societies and institutions,,,,,,,,"(2010) Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research Viewed, , http://innovation.govspace.gov.au/about, About 7 November 2010; Althaus, C., Bridgman, P., Davis, G., (2008) The Australian Policy Handbook, 4. , Illustrated edn, Allen & Unwin; Althaus, C., Bridgman, P., Davis, G., (2000) The Australian Policy Handbook, 4. , Illustrated edn, Allen & Unwin; Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Zaharia, M., A view of cloud computing (2010) Commun.

Through an interpretive content analysis within a media and consulting company, as well as extensive literature review, this paper highlights the role policy plays within organisations and the typical procedures that an organisation goes through when developing an appropriate social media policy. Findings from the research indicate that traditional policy development processes are unsuitable for social media implementation. Some reasons include the blurring of home-work boundaries; the widespread availability of social media tools; and the scope of their use. This is where our new framework is able to shed some light. Our research has uncovered that through increased feedback from various layers of management, new social media policies can be developed to embrace changing situations that are not anticipated with traditional tools, such as email.",Enterprise 2.0; Guidelines; Organisations; Policies; Social media,Content analysis; Guidelines; Literature reviews; Organisations; Policy development; Policy development process; Social media; Industry; Information systems; Public policy; Societies and institutions,,,,,,,,"Alexander, P., Social media 101: A beginner's guide for finance employees (2010) Australian Government Information Management Office; Allen, K., Developing trends and challenges for the information industry examined in the context of the online information conference (2008) Business Information Review, 25 (2), pp. 81-85. , June 1, 2008; Althaus, C., Bridgman, P., Davis, G., (2008) The Australian Policy Handbook, 4. , Illustrated edn, Allen & Unwin; Arts, B., Tatenhove, J.V., Policy and power: A conceptual framework between the 'Old' and 'New' policy idioms (2004) Policy Sciences, 37 (3-4), pp. 339-356; Boulton, C., (2008) IBM's Social Beehive and Discovery Search, , eWeek.com; Brynjolfsson, E., McAfee, A.P., Beyond enterprise 2.0 (2007) Sloan Management Review, 48 (3), pp. 50-55; Bughin, J., The rise of enteprise 2.0 (2008) Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 9 (3), pp. 251-259; Burton, G., Blogs and wikis 'ten years in the making' (2006) Inside Knowledge, , http://www.ikmagazine.com, viewed 14 April 2009; Cook, N., (2008) Enterprise 2.0: How Social Software Will Change the Future of Work, , 1 edn, Gower Publishing Company, Hants, England; Cummings, J.N., Butler, B., Kraut, R., The quality of online social relationships (2002) Commun.

Enterprise 2.0, however, with its Web 2.0-based technologies offers the opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge of the entire organization. But despite the apparent attractiveness of this technology, not all employees are equally willing to adopt and use Enterprise 2.0. In this paper we discuss the phenomenon known as the Empty Quarter which identifies that group of an organization's staff least likely to want to participate in this organizational virtual community, identifying possible reasons for its existence and suggesting some potential solutions. We introduce a preliminary model, the Enterprise 2.0 Uptake Model, to underpin the investigation of this fascinating issue and propose a plan of action for the gathering of appropriate data. We believe this issue is likely to become ever more central as organisations increasingly turn to enterprise content management for their everyday activities. © 2010 IEEE.",,Competitive advantage; Enterprise content managements; Potential solutions; Preliminary model; Virtual community; Web 2.0; Competition; Industry; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Virtual reality; World Wide Web; Technology,,,,,,,,"McAfee, A.P., Enterprise 2.0: The dawn of emergent collaboration (2006) MIT Sloan Management Review, 47, pp. 21-28; Warr, W., Social software: Fun and games, or business tools?
