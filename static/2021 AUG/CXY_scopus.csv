The regression estimator that consists of information not only from the primary variable but also from the auxiliary variable is integrated into the control charting statistic. Optimal designs of the SSGR-AI chart, for the minimization of the expected cost function with and without statistical constraints, are developed based on (i) average run length (ARL) and (ii) expected average run length (EARL). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted, that is, the impact of various input parameters on the optimal parameters and costs for different values of correlation coefficients (ρ) between the primary and auxiliary variables are investigated. In addition, the effects of incorrect specification of the size of the shift on the optimal cost of the SSGR-AI chart are studied. The comparative study reveals that the SSGR-AI chart is superior to the exponentially weighted moving average-AI (EWMA-AI) and synthetic-AI (Syn-AI) charts, for both designs, by giving the smallest costs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",average run length; economic and economic-statistical models; size of the shift is incorrectly specified; SSGR-AI chart,Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Sensitivity analysis; Auxiliary information; Average run lengths; Comparative studies; Correlation coefficient; Economic statistical design; Exponentially weighted moving average; Regression estimators; Statistical constraints; Control charts,,,,,,,"Duncan, A.J., The economic design of charts used to maintain current control of a process (1956) J Am Stat Assoc, 51 (274), pp. 228-242; Woodall, W.H., Weakness of the economic design of control charts (1986) Technometrics, 28 (4), pp. 408-410; Saniga, E.M., Economic statistical control-chart designs with an application to and R charts (1989) Technometrics, 31 (3), pp. 313-320; Lorenzen, T.J., Vance, L.C., The economic design of control charts: a unified approach (1986) Technometrics, 28 (1), pp. 3-10; Chung, K.J.A., A simplified procedure for the economic design of control charts: a unified approach (1991) Eng Optim, 17 (4), pp. 313-320; Yeong, W.C., Khoo, M.B.C., Wu, Z., Castagliola, P., Economically optimal design of a synthetic chart (2012) Qual Reliab Eng Int, 28 (7), pp. 725-741; Lim, S.L., Khoo, M.B.C., Yeong, W.C., Lee, M.H., Economic and economic-statistical designs of the side sensitive group runs chart (2015) Comput Ind Eng, 90, pp. 314-325; Gadre, M.P., Rattihalli, R.N., A side sensitive group runs control chart for detecting shifts in the process mean (2007) Stat Methods Appl, 16 (1), pp. 27-37; Zhang, C.W., Xie, M., Goh, T.N., Economic design of cumulative count of conforming charts under inspection by samples (2008) Int J Prod Econ, 111 (1), pp. 93-104; Ng, P.S., Khoo, M.B.C., Saha, S., Yeong, W.C., Economic and economic-statistical designs of auxiliary information based synthetic and EWMA charts (2019) Commun Stat Simul Comput, , https://doi.org/10.1080/03610918.2019.1664, 575; Riaz, M., Monitoring process mean level using auxiliary information (2008) Stat Neerl, 62 (4), pp. 458-481; Sanusi, R.A., Abbas, N., Riaz, M., On efficient CUSUM-type location control charts using auxiliary information (2018) Qual Technol Quant Manag, 15 (1), pp. 87-105; Abbas, N., Riaz, M., Does, R.J.M.M., An EWMA-type control chart for monitoring the process mean using auxiliary information (2014) Commun Stat-Theory Methods, 43 (16), pp. 3485-3498; Saha, S., Khoo, M.B.C., Umar, A.A., Ng, P.S., Side-sensitive group runs chart for detecting mean shifts using auxiliary information (2019) AIP Conf Proceed, 2184 (1), p. 050010. , -1–, -7; Abbasi, S.A., Riaz, M., Ahmad, S., Sanusi, R.A., Abid, M., New efficient exponentially weighted moving average variability charts based on auxiliary information (2020) Qual Reliab Eng Int, 36 (7), pp. 2203-2224; Haq, A., Abidin, Z.U., An enhanced CUSUM-t chart for process mean (2019) Qual Reliab Eng Int, 35 (7), pp. 2067-2080; Amir, M.W., Raza, Z., Abbas, Z., On increasing the sensitivity of moving average control chart using auxiliary variable (2020) Qual Reliab Eng Int, , https://doi.org/10.1002/qre.2790; Ng, P.S., Khoo, M.B.C., Saha, S., Teh, S.Y., Run sum chart for the mean with auxiliary information (2020) J Test Eval, 8 (2), pp. 1554-1575; Hussain, S., Wang, X., Ahmad, S., Riaz, M., On a class of mixed EWMA-CUSUM median control charts for process monitoring (2020) Qual Reliab Eng Int, 36 (3), pp. 910-946","Khoo, M.B.C.; School of Mathematical Sciences, Malaysia; email: mkbc@usm.my",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,,,7488017,,QREIE,,English,Qual Reliab Eng Int,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100054227

Despite numerous efforts to promote the awareness of healthy food consumption, the obesity rate has been increased in the past few years. An automated food recognition system is needed to serve as a fundamental source of information for promoting a balanced diet and assisting users to understand their meal consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight Neural Architecture Search (LNAS) model to self-generate a thin Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can be executed on mobile devices with limited processing power. LNAS has a sophisticated search space and modern search strategy to design a child model with reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the model generated by LNAS, namely LNAS-NET. The experimental result shows that the proposed LNAS-NET outperformed the state-of-the-art lightweight models in terms of training speed and accuracy metric. Those experiments indicate the effectiveness of LNAS without sacrificing the model performance. It provides a good direction to move toward the era of AutoML and mobile-friendly neural model design. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, the finite horizon process is commonly encountered in industries due to flexible manufacturing production. Past research works on finite horizon process monitoring are still limited. Because of this, three run rules Hotelling's T2 charts are proposed to monitor a finite horizon process. The performance measures of the proposed charts are derived using the Markov-chain approach. The proposed schemes can serve as a framework for quality engineers who wish to perform process monitoring easily and efficiently. Numerical comparisons between the proposed and existing Shewhart (SH) T2 charts have been made. The statistical performance measures were investigated in this article. The findings reveal that the proposed charts outperform the SH T2 chart for detecting small and moderate process shifts in a finite horizon process. The illustration of the run rules (RR) T2 chart is shown on a real manufacturing dataset in a finite horizon process. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",finite horizon process; Markov-chain; quality control; run rules; statistics,Control charts; Graphic methods; Process control; Process monitoring; Finite horizons; Flexible manufacturing; Markov chain approaches; Numerical comparison; Performance measure; Quality engineers; Quality improvement; Statistical performance measures; Markov chains,,,,,,"information Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, 203.PKOMP.6711797This work was funded by the Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Grant Number 203.PKOMP.6711797).

The coefficient of variation (CV) is a common measure of dispersion in many real-life applications. Recently, CV control charts are proposed to monitor processes which do not have a constant mean and a standard deviation which changes with the mean. These processes cannot be monitored by standard control charts which monitor the mean and/or standard deviation. This research proposes the monitoring of the multivariate coefficient of variation (MCV) by means of run rules (RR MCV) control charts, which is not available in the existing literature. The design of these charts is obtained using a Markov-chain approach. The proposed charts are simple to implement. The performance of the RR MCV and Shewhart MCV (SH MCV) charts are compared in terms of the average run length (ARL) and the expected average run length (EARL). An example is illustrated based on a real dataset. The findings revealed that the performance of the proposed charts surpasses the SH MCV chart for detecting small and moderate MCV shifts. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Average run length; expected average run length; Markov-chain; multivariate coefficient of variation; run rules,,,,,,"FP080-2018A

Methods/Statistical analysis: The economic design of the DS X chart with measurement errors is investigated by using the linear covariate error model. The optimal design parameters of the DS X chart are determined through the minimization of the cost function. The effect of the measurement errors is evaluated based on the numerical example over a wide range of the parameters of the measurement errors, where the parameters of the measurement errors are the coefficient B and the measurement error ratio. Findings: The numerical results show that an increase in the value of the coefficient B or a decrease in the value of the measurement error ratio in the linear covariate error model leads to the lower false alarm rate and cost with more frequent sampling interval and smaller number of multiple measurements per item. It can be noticed that the sample sizes at the first and second stages of the DS scheme as well as the out-of-control statistical performance of the DS X chart are robust to the measurement errors. In addition, the warning and control limits of the DS X chart are also not affected by the measurement errors. Application/Improvements: An example is provided to illustrate the implementation of the economic design of the DS X chart with measurement errors. © 2020 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Methods/Statistical analysis: A Markov chain approach is used to compute the MRL and the probabilities of the run length distribution of the Syn MCV chart. The design procedure of the Syn MCV chart based on the MRL is presented to obtain the optimal design parameters by minimizing the out-of-control MRL at a specified shift. Findings: The plots of the probability of the run length distribution show that the skewness of the run length distribution for the Syn MCV chart decreases with the increase in the magnitude of shift. This indicates that when evaluating the performance of the Syn MCV chart, the MRL is a more meaningful criterion compared to the average run length (ARL). The comparison results reveal that the Syn MCV chart is superior against the standard MCV (Std MCV) chart in terms of the MRL. Application/Improvements: The synthetic scheme can be employed to improve the performance of the Std MCV chart based on the MRL. In addition, the numerical results show that the MRL is a better performance measure for the Syn MCV chart compared to the ARL. © 2020, Research Publication.

However, research shows most people do not consume an adequate intake of vegetables per day. An ameliorate dietary assessment for vegetable intake is needed to increase awareness and assist users to improve their vegetable consumption. In this paper, we proposed a novel Quantized Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network (DRCNN) model to ameliorate the fundamental task of dietary assessment. The proposed deep learning strategy integrating a deep residual architecture and a deep learning model, i.e. convolutional neural network, to apply for image-based dietary assessment. The proposed DRCNN model is then deeply fused with post-training quantization techniques to quantize the network weights of the proposed DRCNN model into low-bit fixed-point representations. Extensive experiments have been done to evaluate the proposed model. Results show that the proposed Quantized DRCNN model outperformed the state-of-the-arts, which include the conventional CNN models and also the machine learning models. Those experiments also indicate the effectiveness of the proposed Quantized DRCNN model. Finally, we further evaluate our model with cross-dataset validation to verify the generalization of the proposed model. The experimental result proves that the proposed Quantized DRCNN model is general enough to predict unseen cases and it works well on a wide range of food images. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep residual network; image-based dietary assessment; machine learning; quantized model,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Vegetables; Dietary assessments; Essential elements; Fixed points; Learning models; Learning strategy; Machine learning models; Network weights; State of the art; Learning systems,,,,,203/PKOMP/6711797,This work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by the Malaysian Ministry of Education for the Project entitled New Robust Adaptive Model for the Coefficient of Variation in Infinite and Finite Horizon Processes under Grant 203/PKOMP/6711797.,"Fayet-Moore, F., Mcconnell, A., Cassettari, T., Tuck, K., Petocz, P., Kim, J., Vegetable intake in Australian children and adolescents: The importance of consumption frequency, eating occasion and its association with dietary and sociodemographic factors (2020) Public Health Nutr., 23 (3), pp. 474-487; Teschl, C., Nössler, C., Schneider, M., Carlsohn, A., Lührmann, P., Vegetable consumption among University students: Relationship between vegetable intake, knowledge of recommended vegetable servings and selfassessed achievement of vegetable intake recommendations (2018) Health Edu.

However, very few studies have been done on charts to monitor downward process shifts, which is important since downward process shifts show process improvement. In view of the importance of today’s competitive manufacturing environment, this paper proposes a one-sided chart to monitor the downward multivariate CV (MCV) with variable sample size and sampling interval (VSSI), i.e. the VSSID MCV chart. This paper monitors the MCV as most industrial processes simultaneously monitor at least two or more quality characteristics, while the VSSI feature is incorporated, as it is shown that this feature brings about a significant improvement of the chart. A Markov chain approach was adopted for designing a performance measure of the proposed chart. The numerical comparison revealed that the proposed chart outperformed existing MCV charts. The implementation of the VSSID MCV chart is illustrated with an example. © 2020 Published by ITB Institute for Research and Community Services.",Average time to signal; Downward shifts; Expected average time to signal; Multivariate coefficient of variation; Variable sample size and sampling interval,,,,,,"Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM","This work was funded by the Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [grant number 203.PMGT.6711755].

We study a two-sided Shewhart coefficient of variation chart with measurement errors for detecting both increase and decrease in the coefficient of variation for short run processes using an error model with linear covariate. The performance of the coefficient of variation chart is evaluated by the truncated average run length and the expected value of the truncated average run length. The numerical results indicate that the precision error and the accuracy error have negative effect of the measurement errors on the performance of the coefficient of variation chart. In addition, the constant coefficient B in the linear covariate error model reduces the negative effect of the measurement errors on the performance of the coefficient of variation chart. However, taking multiple measurements per item in each sample is not an effective method to enhance the performance of the coefficient of variation chart. An example is provided to illustrate the implementation of the coefficient of variation chart. In addition, the economic criterion is also added to study the effect of measurement errors on the expected inspection cost. The result shows that an increase in the precision error reduces the expected inspection cost. © 2013 IEEE.",Coefficient of variation; measurement errors; short production runs,Measurement errors; Average run lengths; Coefficient of variation; Constant coefficients; Economic criteria; Effect of measurements; Multiple measurements; Numerical results; Short production runs; Control charts,,,,,,This work was supported by the Sarawak Multimedia Authority (SMA) through Sarawak Digital Economy Research Grant.,"Kang, C.W., Lee, M.S., Seong, Y.J., Hawkins, D.M., A control chart for the coefficient of variation (2007) J.

The effect of process parameter estimation on the expected cost of the synthetic np chart is investigated with the imposed statistical constraints. The minimum number of preliminary subgroups is determined where an almost similar expected cost to the known process parameter case is desired for the given cost model parameters. However, the available number of preliminary subgroups in practice is usually limited, especially when the number of preliminary subgroups is large. Consequently, the optimal chart parameters of the synthetic np chart are computed by considering the practical number of preliminary subgroups in which the cost function is minimized. This leads to a lower expected cost compared to that of adopting the optimal chart parameter corresponding to the known process parameter case. © 2020 Lee et al.

Recently, the MGR scheme was studied using the average number of observations to signal (ANOS) criterion, under the scenario where the process parameters are unknown (Case-U). However, a setback of this study is that the exact shift size must be specified prior to the implementation of this scheme as this is required by the ANOS criterion. In most of the scenarios, practitioners do not have a good knowledge of the exact shift size. To tackle this issue, we propose the use of the expected average number of observations to signal (EANOS) criterion in evaluating the performance of the Case-U MGR scheme. We also proposed the optimal design of the MGR scheme with Case-U based on minimizing out-of-control (OOC) EANOS. Finally, we present an example of application and demonstrate that the proposed procedure eases the implementation of the MGR scheme with Case-U as it minimizes the risk of misspecifying the shift size. © 2019 IEEE.",Estimated process parameters; expected average number of samples; modified group runs scheme; optimal design; shift size,Optimal systems; Average numbers; modified group runs scheme; Optimal design; Process parameters; shift size; Parameter estimation,,,,,IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/2018-C2/C04,"This research is supported by the UTAR Research Fund (UTARRF), no.

The control charting technique is one of the most effective techniques to monitor process quality. In certain processes where the process mean and variance are not independent of one another, the coefficient of variation (CV), which measures the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, should be monitored. In line with industrial settings, where at least two or more variables are monitored simultaneously in most processes, this paper proposes a variable parameter (VP) chart to monitor the multivariate CV (MCV). Formulae and algorithms to optimize the various performance measures are discussed. The proposed VP MCV chart is designed based on a Markov chain approach. The performance comparison shows that the proposed VP MCV chart prevails over the existing MCV charts, in terms of the average time to signal (ATS), standard deviation of the time of signal (SDTS), and expected average time to signal (EATS) criteria. An example is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed VP MCV chart. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",average time to signal; expected average time to signal; Markov chain; multivariate coefficient of variation;

The run length distribution of the CV chart changes from highly skewed when the process is in-control to nearly symmetric when the process is out-of-control at the larger shifts. Therefore, the MRL can be used as an appropriate performance measure to provide a meaningful information for the performance of the CV chart. The procedure for the design of the CV chart based on the MRL will be provided.

In certain areas, such as in finance and healthcare, the process mean and variance are not independent of one another. Hence, adopting traditional control charts monitoring the process mean and variance are dubious. In such situations, the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean should be monitored instead. In real situations, there are many processes monitoring at least two or more quality variables simultaneously. In these processes, the use of univariate control charts will cause erroneous conclusions. This paper proposes a synthetic chart (Syn MCV) to monitor the multivariate CV. Formulae and algorithms to optimize the various performance measures are explained. The proposed chart is numerically compared with its counterparts, in terms of average run length (ARL), standard deviation of the run length (SDRL) and expected average run length (EARL) criteria. The results indicate that the proposed chart has the best performance among its counterparts for all or certain ranges of shifts in the multivariate CV. The application of the proposed Syn MCV chart is illustrated using real dataset from a manufacturing process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Average run length; Control chart; Expected average run length; Multivariate coefficient of variation; Synthetic,monitoring; review,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304/PKOMP/6315170","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia , Short Term Grants [ 304/PKOMP/6315170 ].","Tran, K.P., Designing of run rules t control charts for monitoring changes in the process mean (2018) Chemometr.

Control charting techniques have gained increasing importance recently due to the rapid advancement in technology. Many industries tend to use control charts to monitor the quality of their products or services. The adoption of variable sample size and sampling interval (VSSI) strategy significantly improved the sensitivity of Shewhart X chart in detecting small and moderate process mean shifts, in terms of average time to signal (ATS) criterion when the process shifts are specified. However, for some scenarios in real industries, the process shift size is not set to a specific value. In this case, the expected average time to signal (EATS) can be used as a measure of performance when the process shift is unknown. The EATS of the optimal VSSI X chart is numerically evaluated based on a Markov chain approach. The findings show that the VSSI X chart prevails over the Shewhart X chart under comparison. Being able to vary the sample size and sampling interval, a practitioner will have more flexibility and better control of the process and at the same time is able to detect an out-of-control signal quicker. © 2019 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology.",Expected average time to signal;

The control charting technique is one of the most effective techniques to monitor process quality. In certain processes where the process mean and variance are not independent of one another, the coefficient of variation (CV), which measures the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean should be monitored. Castagliola et al. [21] proposed the two-sided run rules (RR) control charts for monitoring the CV and it is found that the RR CV charts revealed the problem of ARL-biased performances, especially when the monitored sample size is small, for detecting downward CV shifts. This paper alters the RR CV chart by suggesting the two one-sided run rules (ORR) CV charts achieve the unbiased ARL performances. Additionally, this paper also investigates the ORR CV charts in terms of the expected average run length (EARL) criterion, which is not discussed in [21]. A Markov chain model is established for designing the proposed charts. The statistical performances of the ORR CV, RR CV and Shewhart CV (SH CV) charts are compared in terms of the average run length (ARL) and EARL criteria. The results show that the proposed charts surpass the RR CV and SH CV charts for detecting small and moderate upward and downward CV shifts. The implementation of the ORR CV charts is illustrated with an example using a real dataset. © 2019 International Academic Press.",Average run length; Coefficient of variation; Expected average run length; Markov chain; One-sided run rules,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315170,"This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Short Term Grant [Grant Number: 304/PKOMP/6315170].","Bourega, A., Sahraoui, R., Optimal control of the minimal time crisis problem by non-smooth analysis (2019) Statistics, Optimization and Information Computing, 7, pp. 417-438; Rakitzis, A.C., On the performance of modified runs rules x charts with estimated parameters (2017) Communications in Statistics- Simulation and Computation, 46, pp. 1360-1380; Bedeian, A.G., Mossholder, K.W., On the use of the coefficient of variation as a measure of diversity (2000) Organizational Research Methods, 3, pp. 285-297; Muhammad, A.N.B., Yeong, W.C., Chong, Z.L., Lim, S.L., Khoo, M.B.C., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sample size EWMA chart (2018) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 126, pp. 378-398; Acosta-Meija, C.A., Monitoring reduction in variability with the range (1998) IIE Transactions, 30, pp. 515-523; Kang, C.W., Lee, M.S., Seong, Y.J., Hawkins, D.M., A control chart for the coefficient of variation (2007) Journal of Quality Technology, 39, pp. 151-158; Pyne, D.B., Trewin, C.B., Hopkins, W.G., Progression and variability of competitive performance of Olympic swimmers (2004) Journal of Sports Sciences, 22, pp. 613-620; Shepherd, D.K., Rigdon, S.E., Champ, C.W., Using runs rules to monitor an attribute chart for Markov process (2012) Quality Technology & Quantitative Management, 9, pp. 383-406; Antzoulakos, D.L., Rakitzis, A.C., Runs rules schemes for monitoring process variability (2010) Journal of Applied Statistics, 37, pp. 1231-1247; You, H.W., Khoo, M.B.C., Castagliola, P., Haq, A., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using the side sensitive group runs chart (2016) Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 32, pp. 1913-1927; Majika, J.C.M., Chakraborti, S., Graham, M.A., Distribution-free Phase II Mann-Whitney control charts with runs-rules (2016) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 86, pp. 723-735; Ye, J., Feng, P., Xu, C., Ma, Y., Huang, S., A novel approach for chatter online monitoring using coefficient of variation in machining process (2018) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 96, pp. 287-297; Tran, K.P., Designing of run rules t control charts for monitoring changes in the process mean (2018) Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 174, pp. 85-93; Tran, K.P., Castagliola, P., Celano, G., Monitoring the ratio of two normal variables using run rules type control charts (2016) International Journal of Production Research, 54, pp. 1670-1688; Tran, K.P., Tran, Run rules median control charts for monitoring process mean in manufacturing (2017) Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 33, pp. 2437-2450; Tran, K.P., The efficiency of the 4-out-of-5 runs rules scheme for monitoring the ratio of population means of a bivariate normal distribution International Journal of Reliability (2016) Quality and Safety Engineering, 23, pp. 1-6; Khaw, K.W., Khoo, M.B.C., Castagliola, P., Rahim, M.A., New adaptive control charts for monitoring the multivariate coefficient of variation (2018) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 126, pp. 595-610; Khaw, K.W., Khoo, M.B.C., Yeong, W.C., Wu, Z., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sample size and sampling interval control chart (2017) Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation, 46, pp. 5772-5794; Khaw, K.W., Chew, X.Y., Yeong, W.C., Lim, W.C.S.L., Optimal design of the synthetic control chart for monitoring the multivariate coefficient of variation (2019) Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory System, 186, pp. 33-40; Calzada, M., Scariano, S., A synthetic control chart for the coefficient of variation (2013) Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 83, pp. 853-867; Castagliola, P., Achouri, A., Taleb, H., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using control charts with runs rules (2013), 10, pp. 75-94; Castagliola, P., Achouri, A., Taleb, H., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sampling interval control chart (2013) Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 29, pp. 1135-1149; Castagliola, P., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using EWMA charts (2011) Journal of Quality Technology, 43, pp. 249-265; Kritzinger, P., Human, S.W., Chakraborti, S., Improved Shewhart-type runs rules nonparametric sign charts, Communications in Statistics?

The short runs process is commonly seen in production after the industry moved toward flexible manufacturing. Monitoring the coefficient of variation (CV) is useful in a wide variety of scientific areas. In a view of the importance in monitoring the CV and the fact that most real-life data in process monitoring are multivariate in nature, this paper proposes to monitor the multivariate CV in short runs process by means of run rules (RR) control charts. A Markov chain model is established for designing the proposed charts. The statistical performances of the RR multivariate CV (MCV) and Shewhart MCV (SH MCV) charts are compared in terms of the truncated average run length and the expected truncated average run length. The results show that the proposed charts surpass the SH MCV chart for detecting small and moderate multivariate CV shifts.

The optimal design parameters of the VP s chart are derived based on the economic and statistical criteria. The economic-statistical design is performed by minimizing the cost function with the imposed in-control and out-of-control statistical constraints. The cost of the economic-statistical design is slightly higher than the economic design due to the imposed statistical constraints. The effect of cost and process parameters on the optimal design parameters, statistical performance and minimum expected cost is examined and discussed. The comparison results indicate that the cost of the VP s chart is lower than the variable sample size and sampling interval (VSS) s chart, the variable sampling interval (VSI) s chart, the variable sample size (VSS) s chart and the standard s chart. © 2019, © 2019 International Chinese Association of Quantitative Management.",Economic-statistical design;

Control charts are one of the important tools to monitor quality. Recently, control charts monitoring the coefficient of variation (CV) are proposed to monitor processes which do not have a constant mean and a standard deviation which changes with the mean. These processes cannot be monitored by standard control charts which monitor the mean and/or standard deviation. The Variable Sampling Interval (VSI) and Variable Sample Size (VSS) CV charts are two recent charts proposed to improve the detection ability of CV charts. This paper compares the performance between these two charts in terms of the Average Time to Signal (ATS). The comparison shows that the VSS CV chart shows better performance when either a small sample size is taken or when a small shift in the CV needs to be detected. Alternatively, the VSI CV chart outperforms the VSS CV chart. This paper will enable practitioners to know the conditions where the VSS CV chart outperforms the VSI CV chart, and vice versa. Hence, practitioners will be able to decide whether it is better to monitor their processes with a VSI or VSS scheme. © 2019, Avestia Publishing.",Average time to signal; Coefficient of variation; Sample size; Shift size; Variable sample size; Variable sampling interval,,,,,,,,"Castagliola, P., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using EWMA charts (2011) Journal of Quality Technology, 43 (3), pp. 249-265; Apple, F.S., Murakami, M.M., Pearce, L.A., Herzog, C.A., Predictive value of cardiac troponin I and T for subsequent death in end-stage renal disease (2002) Circulation, 106 (23), pp. 2941-2945; Chadban, S.J., Briganti, E.M., Kerr, P.G., Dunstan, D.W., Welborn, T.A., Zimmet, P.Z., Atkins, R.C., Prevalence of kidney damage in Australian adults: The AusDiab kidney study (2003) Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 14, pp. S131-S138; Tian, L., Inferences on the common coefficient of variation (2005) Statistics in Medicine, 24 (14), pp. 2213-2220; Schwartz, L.H., Ginsberg, M.S., DeCorato, D., Rothenberg, L.N., Einstein, S., Kijewski, P., Panicek, D.M., Evaluation of tumor measurements in oncology: Use of film-based and electronic techniques (2000) Journal of Clinical Oncology, 18 (10), pp. 2179-2184; Hamer, A.J., Strachan, J.R., Black, M.M., Ibbotson, C., Elson, R.A., A new method of comparative bone strength measurement (1995) Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology, 19 (1), pp. 1-5; Reed, G.F., Lynn, F., Meade, B.D., Use of coefficient of variation in assessing variability of quantitative assays (2002) Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology, 9 (6), pp. 1235-1239; Seyler, C., Hofstetter, T.B., Hungerbu¨hler, K., Life cycle inventory for thermal treatment of waste solvent from chemical industry: A multi-input allocation model (2005) Journal of Cleaner Production, 13 (13), pp. 1211-1224; Curto, J.D., Pinto, J.C., The coefficient of variation asymptotic distribution in the case of non-iid random variables (2009) Journal of Applied Statistics, 36 (1), pp. 21-32; Pang, W.K., Yu, B.W., Troutt, M.D., Shui, H.H., A simulation-based approach to the study of coefficient of variation of dividend yields (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 189 (2), pp. 559-569; Kang, C.W., Lee, M.S., Seong, Y.J., Hawkins, D.M., A control chart for the coefficient of variation (2007) Journal of Quality Technology, 39 (2), pp. 151-158; Hong, E.P., Kang, C.W., Baek, J.W., Kang, H.W., Development of CV control chart using EWMA technique (2008) Journal of Society of Korea Industrial and Systems Engineering, 31 (4), pp. 114-120; Zhang, J., Li, Z., Chen, B., Wang, Z., A new exponentially weighted moving average control chart for monitoring the coefficient of variation (2014) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 78, pp. 205-212; Calzada, M.E., Scariano, S.M., A synthetic control chart for the coefficient of variation (2013) Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 83 (5), pp. 853-867; Castagliola, P., Achouri, A., Taleb, H., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using control charts with run rules (2013) Quality Technology & Quantitative Management, 10 (1), pp. 75-94; You, H.W., Khoo, M.B.C., Castagliola, P., Haq, A., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using the side sensitive group runs chart (2016) Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 32 (5), pp. 1913-1927; Teoh, W.L., Khoo, M.B.C., Castagliola, P., Yeong, W.C., Teh, S.Y., A run sum control chart for monitoring the coefficient of variation (2017) European Journal of Operational Research, 257 (1), pp. 144-158; Castagliola, P., Achouri, A., Taleb, H., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sampling interval control chart (2013) Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 29 (8), pp. 1135-1149; Reh, W., Scheffler, B., Significance tests and confidence intervals for coefficients of variation (1996) Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 22 (4), pp. 449-452; Castagliola, P., Achouri, A., Taleb, H., Celano, G., Psarakis, S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sample size control chart (2015) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 80 (9-12), pp. 1561-1576; Yeong, W.C., Khoo, M.B.C., Lim, S.L., Lee, M.H., A direct procedure for monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sample size scheme (2017) Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, 46 (6), pp. 4210-4225",,,,Avestia Publishing,"4th World Congress on Mechanical, Chemical, and Material Engineering, MCM 2018",16 August 2018 through 18 August 2018,,141688,23698136,,,,English,"Proc.

Implementing variable sampling interval (VSI) control schemes on control charts rather than traditional fixed sampling interval procedure can significantly improve the control chart's efficiency. In this paper, the VSI run sum (RS) Hotelling's χ2 chart is proposed. The optimal scores and parameters of the proposed chart are determined using an optimization technique to minimize the following: (i) out-of-control average time to signal (ATS); (ii) adjusted ATS (AATS), when the exact shift size can be specified; (iii) expected ATS; or (iv) expected AATS, when the exact shift size cannot be specified. The Markov chain method is used to evaluate the zero-state ATS and expected ATS, and steady-state AATS and expected AATS of the proposed chart. The results show that the VSI RS Hotelling's χ2 chart significantly outperforms the standard RS Hotelling's χ2 chart and the former also performs well compared with other competing charts. By adding more scoring regions, the efficiency of the VSI RS Hotelling's χ2 chart can be further enhanced. An illustrative example using data from a manufacturing process is presented to demonstrate the application of the VSI RS Hotelling's χ2 chart. The application of the proposed chart in a quality improvement program can be extended to management and service industries. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

More recently, research works focused on the use of variable sampling intervals (VSIs), where the lengths of the sampling intervals are varied according to the process quality. A short sampling interval is considered when the process quality indicates a possible out-of-control situation while a long sampling interval is considered, otherwise. In this paper, the VSI run sum (RS) Xchart is proposed with its optimal scores and parameters determined using an optimization technique to minimize the out-of-control average time to signal (ATS) or the adjusted average time to signal (AATS). A Markov-chain method is used to evaluate both the ATS and AATS of the proposed chart, for the zero and steady state cases, respectively. Results show that the VSI RS Xchart is considerably more efficient than the basic RS Xchart. The VSI RS Xchart performs generally well compared with other competing charts, such as the standard X, synthetic X, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) X, VSI Xand VSI EWMA Xcharts. The sensitivity of the VSI RS Xchart can be enhanced further by adding more scoring regions or a head-start feature. An illustrative example is presented to explain the implementation of the proposed VSI RS Xchart. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Adjusted average time to signal; Average time to signal; Control charts; Markov chain; VSI run sum X chart,Chains; Control charts; Flowcharting; Markov processes; Process monitoring; Quality control; Statistical process control; Adjusted average time to signals; Average time to signal; Exponentially weighted moving average; Markov chain method; Optimization techniques; Sampling interval; Variable sampling intervals; X-charts; Process control,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE
