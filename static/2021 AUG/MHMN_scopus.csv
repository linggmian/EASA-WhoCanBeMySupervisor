However, majority of the pre-trained models are trained on color images, which can cause inefficiencies when fine-tuning the models on Covid-19 images which are often grayscale. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning architecture called CovidNet which requires a relatively smaller number of parameters. CovidNet accepts grayscale images as inputs and is suitable for training with limited training dataset. Experimental results show that CovidNet outperforms other state-of-the-art deep learning models for Covid-19 detection. © 2021 THE AUTHORS",Covid-19; Deep neural networks; Occlusion sensitivity maps; Pneumonia,Transfer learning; Automatic Detection; Colour image; Covid-19; Fine tuning; Learning approach; Neural-networks; Occlusion sensitivity map; Pneumonia; Sensitivity map; Transfer learning; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE",This work is supported by the the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the FRGS grant (acc no: 203.PMATHS.6711942).,"Sun, Q., Qiu, H., Huang, M., Yang, Y., Lower mortality of covid-19 by early recognition and intervention: experience from Jiangsu province (2020) Ann.

This paper aims to develop a predictive model for suicide attempts among patients with depression using machine learning algorithms as well as presents a comparative study on single predictive models with ensemble predictive models for differentiating depressed patients with suicide attempts from non-suicide attempters. We applied and trained eight different machine learning algorithms using a dataset that consists of 75 patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder. A recursive feature elimination was used to reduce the features via three-fold cross validation. An ensemble predictive models outperformed the single predictive models. Voting and bagging revealed the highest accuracy of 92% compared to other machine learning algorithms. Our findings indicate that history of suicide attempt, religion, race, suicide ideation and severity of clinical depression are useful factors for prediction of suicide attempts. © The Author(s) 2021.",data mining; depressive disorder; machine learning; predictive model; suicidal behaviour,,,,,,"Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, IPS: USM Bridging Grant [304.PKOM.6316284]

Feature extraction and selection are crucial steps in activity recognition since it determines the accuracy of activity classification. However, existing feature extraction and selection methods involve manual feature engineering, which is time-consuming, laborious and prone to error. Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised feature learning method that automatically extracts and selects the features without human intervention. Specifically, the proposed method jointly trains a convolutional denoising autoencoder with a convolutional neural network to learn the underlying features and produces a compact feature representation of the data. This allows not only more accurate and discriminative features to be extracted but also reduces the computational cost and improves generalization of the classification models. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with deep learning convolutional neural networks on a public dataset. Results have shown that the proposed method can learn a salient feature representation and subsequently recognize the activities with an accuracy of 0.934 and perform comparably well to the convolutional neural networks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Activity recognition;

The proposed approach exploits the advantages of both types of sensing to resolve uncertainties due to missing sensor data. The resulting system is able to infer activities which cannot be inferred with the single type of sensing only. The methodology of ontological modeling the wearable and ambient sensors and the fusion of contexts captured from the sensors, as well as corresponding activity is investigated and described. The proposed system is compared with a system that uses ambient sensors without wearable sensor on the internally collected and publicly available datasets. The results of the experiments show that the proposed system is more robust in handling uncertainties. It is also more capable of inferring additional information about activities, which is not possible with environment sensing only, with overall recognition accuracy of 91.5 and 90% on internal and public datasets, respectively. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,Automation; Ontology; Activities of Daily Living; Ambient sensors; Environment sensing; Ontological modeling; Ontology-based; Recognition accuracy; Sensor fusion; Smart homes; Wearable sensors,,,,,"University of Aizu, UoA",The authors would like to thank Embedded System Research Group for providing sensors and devices utilized in this study.

However, deep learning methods require a vast amount of sensor data to automatically extract the most salient features for activity classification. Therefore, in this paper, a unified generative model is proposed to generate verisimilar data of different activities for activity recognition. The proposed generative model not only able to generate data that have a similar pattern, but also data with diverse characteristics. This allows for data augmentation in activity classification to improve the overall recognition accuracy. Three similarity measures are proposed to assess the quality of the synthetic data in addition to two visual evaluation methods. The proposed generative model was evaluated on a public dataset. The training data was prepared by systematically varying the combination of original and synthetic data. Results have shown that classification using the hybrid training data achieved a comparable recognition accuracy with the classification using the original training data. The performance of the classifiers maintained at the recognition accuracy of 85%. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Activity recognition; Data augmentation; Data generation; Generative adversarial network,Deep learning; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Quality control; Activity classifications; Activity recognition; Adversarial networks; Data augmentation; Human activity recognition; Recognition accuracy; Similarity measure; Visual evaluation; Classification (of information),,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315206,This work has been was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under Short Term Grant 304/PKOMP/6315206.,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., (2016) Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems.

Crack detection and classification is a challenging task because complicated pavement conditions due to the presence of shadows, oil stains and water spot will result in poor visual and low contrast between cracks and the surrounding pavement. In this paper, the network proposed a fully automated crack detection and classification using deep convolution neural network (DCNN) architecture. First, the image of pavement cracks manually prepared in RGB format with dimension of 1024x768 pixels, captured using NIKON digital camera. Next, the image will segmented into patches (32x32 pixels) as a training dataset from the original pavement cracks and trained DCNN with two different filter sizes: 3x3 and 5x5. The proposed method has successfully detected the presence of crack in the images with 98%, 99% and 99% of recall, precision and accuracy respectively. The network was also able to automatically classify the pavement cracks into no cracks, transverse, longitudinal and alligator with acceptable classification accuracy for both filter sizes. There was no significant different in classification accuracy between the two different filters. However, smaller filter size need more processing training time compared to the larger filter size. Overall, the proposed method has successfully achieved accuracy of 94.5% in classifying different types of crack. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Asphalt mixtures; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Highway engineering; Nanostructured materials; Pixels; Roads and streets; Classification accuracy; Convolution neural network; Fully automated; Pavement condition; Pavement cracks; Road and highways; Training dataset; Training time; Crack detection,,,,,,,"Guan, H., Li, J., Yu, Y., Chapman, M., Wang, C., Automated Road Information Extraction from Mobile Laser Scanning Data (2015) IEEE Trans.

Research on asphalt pavement using image processing techniques have been carried but there are still have challenges to the presence of shadows, oil stains and water spot. Therefore, considering the abovementioned issues, this study proposed a fully automated pavement crack detection and classification using deep convolution neural network (DCNN). First, the image of pavement cracks with dimension of 1024x768 pixels, will segmented into patches (32x32 pixels) to prepare training dataset. Next, the trained DCNN with different numbers of layers and different size of filters are employed in network. Upon the evaluation of proposed method, with respect to accuracy and processing time, the result found that the size of filters and convolution layers has an influence on the network performance.

The continuous severity of crack can cause a dangerous environment that may affect the road users. Therefore, an efficient computer algorithm plays an important role in developing analysis tools for automated crack detection. In Malaysia, many of road surveyors are still employing manual inspection, which is a labour-intensive, error-prone and hazardous task. Various attempts have been made to automate this task by using image processing techniques. However the method turns out to suffer from the problem of lighting variation and complexity of the background such as low contrast on the surrounding pavement that similar to the intensity of crack. This study proposed a deep convolution neural network (CNN) as a detection system of ashpalt pavement crack that capable to detect and classify the pavement crack robustly when dealing with complexity background image. A digital camera is used to capture the image of pavement crack. Then, the captured images are divided into two (2) different grid scales, 32× 32 and 64× 64, and further fed as input to the first deep CNN. For each grid size, the network is trained independently to detect the presence of crack in the image. In the classification stage, the captured images are binarized with the similar grid scales to extract the crack pattern. The binary images containing two types of crack, transverse and longitudinal are then fed as input to the second deep CNN and trained to identify the type of crack. Experimental results show that deep CNN using 32x32 grid scale images provides higher performance for crack detection and classification compared to 64x64. The network achieved the recall, precision and accuracy of 98.0%, 99.4% and 99.2% respectively for crack and non-crack detection, while the performance for transverse and longitudinal achieved the accuracy of 98% and 97% © 2018 IEEE.",asphalt pavement crack; crack classification; crack detection; deep convolution neural network,Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Binary images; Complex networks; Control systems; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Background image; Convolution neural network; Crack classification; Image processing technique; Labour-intensive; Lighting variations; Manual inspection; Pavement distress; Crack detection,,,,,,,"Lee, B., Erdenee, E., Jin, S., Kyu, P., Efficient object detection using convolutional neural network-based hierarchical feature modeling (2016) Signal, Image Video Process; Wang, X., Hu, Z., Grid-based pavement crack analysis using deep learning (2017) 2017 4th International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety, ICTIS 2017-Proceedings, pp. 917-924; Jing, L., Aiqin, Z., Pavement crack distress detection based on image analysis (2010) 2010 Int.

Naturally, an optimum window size varies depending on the characteristics of activity signals and fixed window size will not produce good segmentation for all activities. This paper presents a novel approach to activity signal segmentation for physical activity recognition. Central to the approach is that the window size is adaptively adjusted according to the probability of the signal belongs to a particular activity to achieve the most effective segmentation. In addition, an activity transition diagram for activity recognition is developed to validate the activity transition and improve recognition accuracy. The adaptive sliding window segmentation algorithm and the role of activity transition diagram are described in the context of physical activity recognition. The approach recognizes not only well defined static and dynamic activities, but also transitional activities. The presented approach has been implemented, evaluated and compared with an existing state-of-the-art approach by using internal and public datasets which contains activity signals of dynamic, static and transitional activities. Results have shown that the proposed adaptive sliding window segmentation achieves overall accuracy of 95.4% in all activities considered in the experiments compared to the existing approach which achieved an overall accuracy of 89.9%. The proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy of 96.5% compared to 91.9% overall accuracy with the existing approach when tested on the public dataset. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Activity recognition; Activity transition diagram; Adaptive sliding window; Signal segmentation,Dynamics; Activity recognition; Adaptive sliding windows; Recognition accuracy; Segmentation algorithms; Signal segmentation; State-of-the-art approach; Transition diagram; Triaxial accelerometer; Pattern recognition,,,,,,,"(2014), http://www.who.int/ageing/en/, [Online].

An obstacle to its wider use is that the imperfect observations result in failure of recognizing activities. This paper proposes a novel reasoning algorithm for activity recognition in smart environments. The algorithm integrates OWL ontological reasoning mechanism with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence to provide support for handling uncertainty in activity recognition. It quantifies uncertainty while aggregating contextual information and provides a degree of belief that facilitates more robust decision making in activity recognition. The presented approach has been implemented and evaluated on an internal and public datasets and compared with a data-driven approach that is using hidden Markov model. Results have shown that the proposed reasoning approach can accommodate uncertainties and subsequently infer the activities more accurately in comparison with existing ontology-based recognition and perform comparably well to the data-driven approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.,Activity recognition; Dempster–Shafer theory; Missing sensor data; Ontological reasoning; Uncertainty reasoning,Decision making; Formal logic; Hidden Markov models; Pattern recognition; Activity recognition; Ontological reasoning; Sensor data; Shafer theory; Uncertainty reasoning; Ontology,,,,,,,"Alam, M.R., Reaz, M.B.I., Ali, M.A.M., A review of smart homes—past, present, and future (2012) IEEE Trans.

Specifically, there is no optimum fixed window size because it is subject to the characteristics of the activity signals. This paper presents a novel approach of activity signal segmentation for enhanced physical activity recognition. Central to the approach is that the window size could be dynamically adjusted by using signal information to determine the most effective segmentation. The approach recognizes not only well defined static and dynamic activities, but also transitional activities. The presented approach has been implemented, evaluated and compared with an existing approach and the fixed sliding window approach in a number of experiments. Results have shown that dynamic window segmentation achieved better overall accuracy of 96% in all activities considered in the experiments compared to the existing approach. © 2015 IEEE.",Accelerometer; Activity Recognition; Decision Tree classifier; Dynamic Window; Signal Segmentation,Accelerometers; Decision trees; Industrial electronics; Pattern recognition; Activity recognition; Decision tree classifiers; Dynamic windows; Overall accuracies; Physical activity; Signal information; Signal segmentation; Triaxial accelerometer; Dynamics,,,,,,,"Najafi, B., Aminian, K., Loew, F., Blanc, Y., Robert, P.A., Measurement of stand-sit and sit-stand transitions using a miniature gyroscope and its application in fall risk evaluation in the elderly (2002) IEEE Trans.

Knee swinging ergometer is introduced as a hybrid exercise for restoration of function of the knee for stroke patients through the application of functional electrical stimulation. The aim of the new FESassisted knee swinging ergometer is to provide high intensity exercise. This will elongate the exercise duration and avoid early muscle fatigue. The ergometer is designed to utilize the voluntary non-paretic leg movement in assisting the FESinduced paretic leg of stroke patient. A humanoid with muscle model was developed and incorporated with the ergometer to perform simulation of FES-assisted knee swinging exercise. PID controller is used to achieve full knee extension during each cycle of knee swinging exercise. Simulation results show that the ergometer is able to reduce half of the required electrical stimulation. In conclusion, the new knee swinging ergometer is able to avoid early muscle fatigue in performing high intensity knee exercise through electrical stimulation.",Functional electrical stimulation; Knee swinging ergometer; Muscle fatigue; Muscle model,,,,,,,,"Kimberley, T.J., Lewis, S.M., Auerbach, E.J., Dorsey, L.L., Lojovich, J.M., Carey, J.R., Electrical stimulation driving functional improvements and cortical changes in subjects with stroke (2004) Exp Brain Res, 154 (4), pp. 450-460. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-003-1695-y, Feb; Ajoudani, A., Erfanian, A., Neuro-sliding mode control with modular models for control of knee-joint angle using quadriceps electrical stimulation (2007) Proc.

It is a tool that is routinely used in genetics, microbiology, forensics, molecular biology and biochemistry. GE is also used in separating DNA, RNA and protein molecules by using electric field applied to a gel matrix. This paper describes the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that is a population-based optimization technique based on the sociological interaction associated with bird flocking using the Kapur thresholding method to segment the DNA bands from the background. PSO is employed to achieve the optimum threshold levels selection. In addition, PSO greatly reduces the computational time. Median filter is used prior image segmentation to remove noise and ambiguous pixels. The experimental results show that the application the optimization technique on Kapur method successfully produces good separation of DNA bands from the background. © 2013 IEEE.",Gel electrophoresis (GE); Kapur method; Multilevel Thresholding; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),Computational time; Gel electrophoresis; Gel electrophoresis images; Kapur method; Multilevel thresholding; Optimization techniques; Population-based optimization; Thresholding methods; Artificial intelligence; Communication systems; DNA; Electric fields; Electrophoresis; Image segmentation; Molecular biology; Tools; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),,,,,,,"Maramis, C., Delopoulos, A., Efficient quantitative information extraction from pcr-rflp gel electrophoresis images (2010) Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2010 20th International Conference on, pp. 2560-2563. , 23-26 Aug; Akbari, A., Albregtsen, F., Automatic segmentation of dna bands in one dimensional gel images produced by hybridizing techniques (2004) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society 2004.

Early detection and treatment of breast cancer can increase the survival rate of patients. Presently, the method of diagnosis depends on the human experiences. The method is time-consuming, subjected to human error and cause unnecessary burden to radiologists. This paper introduces an automatic breast cancer diagnosis technique using a genetic algorithm (GA) for simultaneous feature selection and parameter optimization of artificial neural networks (ANN). The performances of the proposed algorithm employing three different variations of the backpropagation technique for the fine tuning of the weight of ANN are compared. The algorithm is called the GAANN-XX where the XX refers to the back-propagation training variation used. The proposed algorithms called GAANN-RP produces the best and average, 99.43% and 98.29% correct classification respectively on the Wiscinson Breast Cancer Dataset. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Back-propagation; Classification Accuracy; Feature Selection; Genetic Algorithm,Backpropagation techniques; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer diagnosis; Classification accuracy; Fine tuning; Human errors; Parameter optimization; Survival rate; Backpropagation algorithms; Classification (of information); Communication systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Patient treatment; Genetic algorithms,,,,,,,"Übeyli, E.D., Implementing automated diagnostic systems for breast cancer detection (2007) Expert Syst.

The piezoresistive MEMS sensor is integrated with potentiometric indicator system that converts a biochemical signal into a measurable signal. The overall project involved transduction stage, filtering, voltage follower, and linearization stage. The design of this new approach is implemented using Cadence OrCAD Capture CIS 15.7 software and the miniaturization part uses SMT and troubleshooting. The advantages of SMT over the older through-hole technique are surface mount allows for much smaller components to be used which, in turn, allows for smaller, more portable and lightweight electronic device application. Details descriptions of the hardware for the circuit miniaturization will be presented. From the previous research, it has been found that for a sensor input range of 1.1 to 1.3kilo ohms, an output range of-100 to +100 millivolts is obtained. The result from the SMT testing indicates discrepancy within 10.75% was found for the last output stage on the average, which could be attributed to tolerance of electronic components and wiring. This development allowed stress measurement with relatively high precision and accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.",Human Stress; Miniaturization; Potentiometric Indicator System; Surface Mount Technology,Biochemical signal; Circuit miniaturization; Electronic component; Electronic device; Human stress; Indicator system; Miniaturization; Voltage follower; Industrial electronics; Miniature instruments; Potentiometers (electric measuring instruments); Sensors; Surface mount technology,,,,,,,"Yamaguchi, M., Kanemori, T., Kanemaru, M., Takai, N., Mizuno, Y., Yoshida, H., Performance evaluation of salivary amylase activity monitor (2004) Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 20, pp. 491-497; Lee, M.H., Lee, H.K., Bang, S., Development stress monitoring system based on personal digital assistant (pda) (2004) Proceeding of the 26th Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, , San Francisco, CA, USA; Bond, G.C.H.D., Lifestyle-specific outcome measures (2000) The International Electronic Journal of Health Education, pp. 159-168; Takai, N., Aragaki, T., Eto, K., Uchihashi, K., Nishikawa, Y., Effect of psychological stress on the salivary cortisol and amylase levels in healthy young adults (2004) Achieves of Oral Biology, pp. 963-968; Chun-Chieh, H., Shao-Hang, H., Jen-Feng, C., Van, L.D., Chin-Teng, L., Front-end amplifier of low-noise and tunable BW/gain for portable biomedical signal acquisition (2008) Circuits and Systems, 2008.

The system aims to assist medical technologist and improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis. A typical architecture of a computer-aided TB diagnosis system consists of image processing, feature extraction and classification. Finding an effective classifier for the system has been regarded as a critical topic, in order to improve the detection performance and avoid making false decision. In this study, the recent method called compact single hidden layer feedforward neural network (C-SLFN) trained by an improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is evaluated for detecting the TB bacilli. Six affine moment invariants are extracted from segmented tissue slide images and fed into the C-SLFN. The network is trained and classified the input patterns into three classes: TB, overlapped TB and non-TB. Further, the study compares the network performance with a SLFN trained using the standard ELM algorithm. The results obtained from this study suggested that the standard ELM still outperformed the C-SLFN in term of classification accuracy. The standard ELM, however requires a large number of hidden nodes compares to the C-SLFN. © 2011 IEEE.",compact single hidden layer feedforward neural network; Extreme Learning Machine; image processing; tuberculosis bacilli detection,Affine moment invariants; Classification accuracy; Clinical diagnosis; Detection performance; Diagnosis systems; Extreme learning machine; Feature extraction and classification; Feed-forward network; Hidden layers; Hidden nodes; Imaging technology; Input patterns; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Research and development; Single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks; Artificial intelligence; Bacilli; Computer aided diagnosis; Control systems; Feature extraction; Feedforward neural networks; Image processing; Learning systems; Network performance; Tissue; Tubes (components); Network layers,,,,,,,"(2009) Global Tuberculosis Control.

The FES-rowing is introduced as a total body exercise for rehabilitation of function of lower body through the application of functional electrical stimulation (FES). The neuro-fuzzy control technique is a control technique that combines fuzzy logic controller and a neural network, which makes the controller self tuning and adaptive. An adaptive control strategy is purposed to control the FES-rowing with the adaptation of the muscle fitness of the physiological based muscle model in the FLC. The adaptive control is able to modify the control law used by the FLC to cope with the muscle fatigue in adjusting the rowing ergometer inclination and generating the stimulation pulse width required by the system. This study indicates that the self adaptive neuro-fuzzy control developed provides an effective mechanism for automatically adjusting the ergometer inclination and regulating the stimulation pulse width for FES-rowing to overcome muscle fatigue. © 2011 IEEE.",adaptive control; FES; neuro-fuzzy; rowing; rowing exercise,Adaptive Control; FES; Neuro-Fuzzy; rowing; rowing exercise; Adaptive control systems; Controllers; Functional electric stimulation; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Muscle; Physiological models; SportS,,,,,,,"Chizeck, H.J., Adaptive and nonlinear control methods for neural prosthesis (1992) Neural Prostheses: Replacing Motor Functional after Disease or Disability, pp. 298-328. , R.
