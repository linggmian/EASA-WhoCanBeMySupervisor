In today’s world, magnetic resonance imaging is used for determining the brain tumor types in an effective manner. The manual classification of brain tumor consumes more time and also applicable for a limited number of images, so a deep learning-based model is proposed in this research paper for automatic classification of brain tumor types. At first, the brain images are collected from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image dataset. Then, the normalization technique and histogram of oriented gradients are employed to improve the visible level of the collected raw brain images and to extract the feature vectors from the normalized brain images. The histogram descriptor effectively describes the edge and contour features of the images related to other feature descriptors. Further, the extracted features are given as the input to convolutional neural networks to classify meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors. The hard swish-based RELU activation function is included in convolutional neural networks that effectively improve the classification performance and learning speed. In the experimental phase, the proposed model achieved 98.6% of accuracy that is better compared to the existing algorithms like deep convolutional neural network with transfer learning and fine-tuning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",A histogram of oriented gradients;

Various medical data classification methods are developed in the existing research works, but to achieve higher performance in terms of classification accuracy result in a great challenge in the medical sector due to the presence of missing values, uncertainty and redundant attributes. Hence, an effective and optimal data classification method named Atom Taylor Bird Swarm Algorithm-based Deep Belief Network (Atom Taylor BSA-based DBN) is proposed in this research to perform incremental classification using medical data. The proposed Atom Taylor BSA is designed by integrating the atom search optimization (ASO) with the Taylor Bird Swarm algorithm (Taylor BSA), which is the development of the Taylor series with BSA. The DBN classifier effectively performs the incremental classification using medical data with its associated neurons and generates optimal result based on the fitness measure. Accordingly, the selected features enable the classifier to increase the performance of classification accuracy. However, the proposed Atom Taylor BSA-based DBN obtained better performance using the metrics, like specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy with the values of 0.8307, 0.9074, and 0.8804, using Hungarian dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",Atom search optimization (ASO);

Thus, the extraction of valuable knowledge, and making scientific decisions for the treatment of disease, has progressively become necessary to attain effective diagnosis. The obtainability of a large amount of medical data leads to the requirement of effective data analysis tools for extracting constructive knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method for heart disease diagnosis. Here, the pre-processing of medical data is done using log-transformation that converts the data to its uniform value range. Then, the feature selection process is performed using sparse fuzzy-c-means (FCM) for selecting significant features to classify medical data. Incorporating sparse FCM for the feature selection process provides more benefits for interpreting the models, as this sparse technique provides important features for detection, and can be utilized for handling high dimensional data. Then, the selected features are given to the deep belief network (DBN), which is trained using the proposed Taylor-based bird swarm algorithm (Taylor-BSA) for detection. Here, the proposed Taylor-BSA is designed by combining the Taylor series and bird swarm algorithm (BSA). The proposed Taylor-BSA-DBN outperformed other methods, with maximal accuracy of 93.4%, maximal sensitivity of 95%, and maximal specificity of 90.3%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular, brain cancer holds the least rate of survival than all other cancer types. The categorization of a brain tumor depends upon the various factors such as texture, shape and location. The medical experts have preferred the appropriate treatment to the patients, based on the accurate identification of tumor type. The process of segmenting the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has high complicacy during the analysis of brain tumor, owing to its variable shape, location, size, and texture. The physicians and radiologists can easily detect and categorize the tumors if there exists a system by combining Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI). An approach of automated segmentation has proposed in this paper, which enables the segmentation of tumor out of MRI images, besides enhances the efficiency of segmentation and classification. The initial functions of this approach include preprocessing and segmentation processes for segmenting tumor or tissue of benign and malignant by expanding a range of data and clustering. A modern learning-based approach has suggested in this study, in order to process the automated segmentation in multimodal MRI images to identify brain tumor, hence the clustering algorithm of Bat Algorithm with Fuzzy C-Ordered Means (BAFCOM) has recommended segmenting the tumor. The Bat Algorithm calculates the initial centroids and distance within the pixels in the clustering algorithm of BAFCOM, which also acquires the tumor through determining the distance among tumor Region of Interest (RoI) and non-tumor RoI. Afterwards, the MRI image has analyzed by the Enhanced Capsule Networks (ECN) method to categorize it as normal and brain tumor. Ultimately, the algorithm of ECN has assessed the performance of proposed approach by distinguishing the two categories of the tumor over MRI images, besides the suggested ECN classifier has assessed by the measurement factors of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, the genetic algorithm has applied to process the automatic tumor stage classification, which in turn classification accuracy enhanced. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

People travel for business, study, vacation, religious activity and many more. Nonetheless, while travelling, their safety and health condition can be a major concern to travelers as well as concern from their family members. There exists many existing smart traveler app for the purpose of locating a traveler. However, they might produce accurate location. Predicting location in all apps is largely based on the speed of a walking traveler. This paper discusses the techniques for more accurate location tracking and location prediction of a traveler. The techniques are able to track the movement of the traveler using location tracking techniques and predict the location of a missing traveler based on parameters such as walking speed, age, gender, weather condition and the health condition. The results based on an app developed in this research show that the techniques are more accurate and efficient. Also, with these techniques, a better emergency alert system can be incorporated in a smart traveler app. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Smart traveler app,Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Tracking (position); Accurate location; Emergency alert system; Health condition; Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Safety and healths; Tracking techniques; Location,,,,,,,,"Reidenberg, J.R., Gellman, R., Debelak, J., Elewa, A., Liu, N., (2013) Privacy and Missing Persons after Natural Disasters, p. 128. , Washington, DC and New York, NY: Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham Law School and Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, p; (2016) Munich Attack: Teenage Gunman Kills Nine People at Shopping Centre, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/22/munich-shopping-centre-evacuated-after-reported-shooting-germany, Accessed 22 Sept 2016; (2015) Hajj Pilgrimage: More than 700 Dead in Crush near Mecca, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/mecca-crush-during-hajj-kills-at-least-100-saudi-state-tv, Accessed 22 Sept 2016; (2016) Louisiana Faces Ongoing Flood Danger as Obama Declares Federal Disaster Zone, , https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-disaster-obama-baton-rouge-mississippi, Accessed 23 Sept 2016; Wang, S., Min, J., Yi, B.K., Location based services for mobiles: Technologies and standards (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC 2008), pp. 35-38. , pp; Steiniger, S., Neun, M., Edwardes, A., (2006) Foundations of Location Based Services-Lecture Notes, , https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b56b/f42dd39a383c07e5eeb01498309e6e52b8af, Zurich: Department of Geography, University of Zurich; Zahradnik, F., (2016) Wi-Fi Positioning System, , https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-positioning-system-1683343, Accessed 20 Oct 2016; Fitzpatrick, K., Brewer, M.A., Turner, S., Another look at pedestrian walking speed (2006) Transp.

Data collected from the various resources are dirty and this will affect the accuracy of prediction result. Data cleansing offers a better data quality which will be a great help for the organization to make sure their data is ready for the analyzing phase. However, the amount of data collected by the organizations has been increasing every year, which is making most of the existing methods no longer suitable for big data. Data cleansing process mainly consists of identifying the errors, detecting the errors and corrects them. Despite the data need to be analyzed quickly, the data cleansing process is complex and time-consuming in order to make sure the cleansed data have a better quality of data. The importance of domain expert in data cleansing process is undeniable as verification and validation are the main concerns on the cleansed data. This paper reviews the data cleansing process, the challenge of data cleansing for big data and the available data cleansing methods. © 2019 The Authors.",Big data; Data cleansing; Data quality,Information systems;

Matrix multiplication is under the list of time-consuming problems that require s huge computational resources to improve its speedup. As many studies have shown, it is not easy to achieve high performance speedup in sequential matrix multiplication algorithm using larger input. The emphasis of this study is to propose a parallel algorithm to calculate the product of two square matrices with improved speedup performance compared to the sequential and OpenMP algorithms. In this research, biruni (super machine workstation) in the School of Computer Sciences, USM, Malaysia with General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GU) was used to parallelize the matrix product algorithm. A comparison between parallel OpenMp versions and sequential algorithm with the proposed CUDA based algorithm of this research was carried out to evaluate the speedup performance of the proposed parallel CUDA based algorithm. The overall results show that CUDA based parallel matrix multiplication is approximately 400 times faster than sequential matrix multiplication and 4 times faster than OpenMp matrix multiplication algorithms, respectively. Therefore, the proposed parallel algorithm can help the researchers working with matrix multiplication application problems. It can also help mathematicians to easily calculate the product of any two matrices and obtain the result in a shorter time. © 2019 The Authors.",C language; CUDA; GPGU; Matrix multiplication; Parallelization,Application programming interfaces (API); C (programming language); Computer graphics; Computer workstations; Graphics processing unit; Information systems; Information use; Parallel algorithms; Problem oriented languages; Program processors; C language; CUDA; GPGU; MAtrix multiplication; Parallelizations; Matrix algebra,,,,,,,,"Yegnanarayanan, V., An application of matrix multiplication (2013) Resonance, 18, pp. 368-377; Krishnan, K., Nieplocha, J., Optimizing parallel multiplication operation for rectangular and transposed matrices (2004) Proceedings, Tenth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, ICPADS 2004, pp. 257-266; Sotiropoulos, I., Papaefstathiou, I., A fast parallel matrix multiplication reconfigurable unit utilized in face recognitions systems (2009) International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Application, pp. 276-281; Idris, M., Idna, Y., Noor, N.M., Tamil, E.Md., Razak, Z., Arof, H., Parallel matrix multiplication design for monocular SLAM (2010) Fourth Asia International Conference on Mathematical/Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation (AMS), pp. 492-497; Zheng, J.-H., Zhang, L.-J., Zhu, R., Ning, K., Liu, D., Parallel matrix multiplication algorithm based on vector linear combination using MapReduce (2013) IEEE Ninth World Congress on Services (SERVICES), pp. 193-200; Kim, M., Jang, Y.J., Ro, W.W., Parallel transpose of matrix multiplication based on the tiling algorithms (2011) IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS), pp. 1-3; Li, H.L., Fox, G., Qiu, J., Performance model for parallel matrix multiplication with dryad: Dataflow graph runtime (2012) Second International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing 2012 (CGC2012), pp. 675-683; (2017) Excel Matrix Multiplication - Replacing MMULT with Power Query, , https://datachant.com/2016/06/01/excel-matrix-multiplication-replacing-mmult-with-power-query/, Accessed 13rd November 2017; Weisstein, E., (2017) Matrix Multiplication, , http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixMultiplication.html; Deng, J., Application of matrix in computer science and technology (2014) Applied Mechanics & Materials; Piedra, R.M., A parallel approach for matrix multiplication on the TMS320C4X Dsp (1994) Texas Instruments SPRA107, pp. 1-24; Murni, A.B., Ernastuti, T.H., Kerami, D., Hypergraph Partitioning Implementation for Parallelizing Matrix-Vector Multiplication Using CUDA GPU-based Parallel Computing (2017) AIP Conference Proceedings; Nagasaka, Y., Nukada, A., Matsuoka, S., High-performance and memory-saving sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication for NVIDIA Pascal GPU (2017) 46th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP2017), pp. 101-110; Bell, N., Garland, M., Efficient sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication on CUDA (2008) NVIDIA Technical Report NVR-2008-004, , Nvidia Corporation; Hochberg, R., (2012) Matrix Multiplication with CUDA-A Basic Introduction to the CUDA Programming Model, , http://www.shodor.org/media/content/petascale/materials/UPModules/matrixMultiplication/moduleDocument.pdf, Accessed 11st August 2012","Wan Zainon, W.M.N.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: nazmee@usm.my",Younus A.,,Elsevier B.V.,"5th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2019",23 July 2019 through 24 July 2019,,156995,18770509,,,,English,Procedia Comput.

This method uses metadata in the form of test results of a given set of algorithms on a given set of datasets and calculates an average rank for each algorithm. The ranks are used to construct the average ranking. In this paper we investigate the problem of how the rankings can be reduced by removing non-competitive and redundant algorithms, thereby reducing the number of tests a user needs to conduct on a new dataset to identify the most suitable algorithm. The method proposed involves two phases. In the first one, the aim is to identify the most competitive algorithms for each dataset used in the past. This is done with the recourse to a statistical test. The second phase involves a covering method whose aim is to reduce the algorithms by eliminating redundant variants. The proposed method differs from one earlier proposal in various aspects. One important one is that it takes both accuracy and time into consideration. The proposed method was compared to the baseline strategy which consists of executing all algorithms from the ranking. It is shown that the proposed method leads to much better performance than the baseline. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Algorithm selection; Average ranking; Eliminating non-competitive; Meta-learning; Redundant algorithms,Application programs; Algorithm selection; Average ranking; Classification algorithm; Competitive algorithms; Effective algorithms; Eliminating non-competitive; Metalearning; Selection methods; Statistical tests,,,,,"Rare Disease Foundation, RDF: POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961

This is because of the inconsistencies between software properties. Matching is a fundamental operation for UML model reuse, as such accurate matching between models’ elements results in better reuse of such models. UML models consist of number of properties such as functional properties, structural properties, and behavioral properties. Such properties are source of numerous errors during software matching, because each property represents software system from different views. In this paper we empirically investigate the use of different weight values when computing the similarity of software system from multiple views.

The key issue in testing is determining the sufficiency of tests and, traditionally this has been done by using the Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs). However, SRGMs are not applicable when there are no stabilization phases as required by most software reliability models. Test-Defect Coverage Analytics Model (TDCAM) has been proposed to address this problem. This paper proposes the application of visual analytic techniques as an approach for supporting informed decision making in deciding the sufficiency of tests. Visual analytics research considers interactive visualization as the common platform for combining various computational data analysis techniques to support the analytical reasoning process. We presented four visual representations of TDCAM to demonstrate how analytical models have been applied to indicate the adequacy of tests in relation to sufficient and efficient test coverage. The techniques provide an effective and generally applicable test estimation on the basis of a general trend that higher test coverage correlates with higher probability of detecting more defects. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Software reliability; Software testing; Software visualization; Test analytics; Visual analytics,Application programs; Data visualization; Decision making; Software reliability; Testing; Visualization; Analytic technique; Analytical reasoning; Interactive visualizations; Software reliability growth models; Software reliability models; Software visualization; Visual analytics; Visual representations; Software testing,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304.PKOMP.6316282",The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia Bridging Research Grant Scheme (304.PKOMP.6316282) for the financial support.

This paper presents a mobile-based method for mangrove species identification called multi-layer mangrove species identification method (MSIA) and its application for Kilim Geo-forest Park, in Langkawi, Malaysia. This work involves formulating the identification method, the design and development of the mobile application, and its integration with the Mangrove Reference Data Centre. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to support visitors with limited knowledge on the mangrove tree species. One of the main features of MSIA is the automatic identification of the mangrove tree species based on its leaf which enhances the performance of species identification. Firstly, the mangrove tree leaf is captured using the mobile phone camera. Next, the first layer in the identification method is carried out to identify the leaf shape. Once the species has been identified, additional parameters such as types of tree root, tree bark, flower or fruit will be entered in the second layer of the identification process. A specific mangrove species common name and its related information such as biological information and possible medicinal or commercial worth of the species will then be displayed. This paper presents the design and implementation of MSIA as well as the testing and the evaluation of the method and its application. It is believed that MSIA would make a visit to the mangrove park more meaningful and enjoying to the visitors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Mangrove species; Multi-Layer identification,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image processing; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Plants (botany); Automatic identification; Biological information; Design and Development; Design and implementations; Identification process; Mangrove species; Species identification; User friendly interface; Forestry,,,,,,,,"(2009) Langkawi Mangrove Biodiversity Database, , http://www.mangrove.my/page.php?; Kumar, N., Belhumeur, P.N., Biswas, A., Jacobs, D.W., Kress, W.J., Lopez, I.C., Soares, J.V.B., Leafsnap: A computer vision system for automatic plant species identification (2012) ECCV 2012, Part II.

The Somali language is officially written with the Latin alphabet. Before 1990, the Somali language was the main instruction of the educational institutions in Somalia. However, after the collapse of the Somali central government, foreign languages such as Arabic and English have been taking over as the languages of instruction in Somali educational institutions such as schools and universities. It is feared that the language may die out in about 50 years. One reason for this is a lack of computer tools such as word processors with spell checkers which may promote the use of Somali language. The absence of a spell checker in Somali may lead to spelling mistakes in Somali written documents, including social media posts and friendly chats. The focus of this paper is to propose a spell checker for Somali Language using Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching Algorithm with Corpus. A spell checker for the Somali language will provide a word processing interface for writing documents that identifies a misspelled word, underlines it, and suggests the proper spelling of the typed word, if any. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Corpus; Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm; Somali language; Spell checker,Soft computing; Central government; Corpus; Educational institutions; National language; Official languages; Somali language; Spell checker; Written documents; Word processing,,,,,,,,"Orwin, M., Somalia: Language situation A2 (2006) Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, pp. 509-510. , Brown, K.

The ambiguous requirements could cause the software developers to develop software which is different from what the customer needs. The focus of this paper is to propose an approach to detect syntax and syntactic ambiguity in software requirements specification. In this paper, Parts of speech (POS) tagging technique has been used to detect these ambiguities. A prototype tool has been developed in order to evaluate the proposed approach. The evaluation is done by comparing the detection capabilities of the proposed tool against human capabilities. The overall results show that the humans do have some difficulties in detecting ambiguity in software requirements, especially the syntactic ambiguity and software requirements that contains both syntax and syntactic ambiguity in one sentence. The proposed tool can definitely help the analyst in detecting ambiguity in Software requirements. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",Part of speech tagging; Software requirements specification; Syntactic ambiguity; Syntax ambiguity,,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: 203/PKOMP/6711533

Natural languages are basically ambiguous which makes the requirements documented in software requirements specification document unclear.

Reusing of early-stage software artifacts such as UML state machine diagrams increases the benefit reaped from reuse because it allows the reuse of related later-stage artifacts. Among the reuse task, matching and retrieval of similar artifacts from repository are considered the most important task. However, the space for searching the most similar artifacts from the repository can be large, and heuristics algorithm can efficiently be used to search large repositories. Existing work in the literature are based on graph matching using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swamp Optimization (PSO). Different to the existing works, this paper presents the use of Finite State Machine and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) to match and retrieve state machine diagrams from repository. Experimental results show that our method is effective in retrieving the most similar state machine diagrams from repository for a given query. © 2017 IEEE.",CSA; FSM; GA; ML; models; retrieval; reuse,Gallium; Genetic algorithms; Graphic methods; Learning algorithms; Models; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pattern matching; Software design; Cuckoo search algorithms; Heuristics algorithm; retrieval; reuse; Software artifacts; Software repositories; State machine diagrams; UML state machine; Computer software reusability,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE

Reusing components during the development of software reduces time and cost which could also enhance reliability and quality of the concept of reuse. In this paper, a software reuse model is established where it shows the overall process of retrieving the relevant use cases. A database is built and a prototype is developed based on the model. Levenshtein Distance algorithm is applied in computing the similarity score. A list of relevant use cases is displayed as a result. Evaluation criteria such as recall and precision are used to evaluate the result.

Therefore, in this paper we will discuss about applying various types of Tree-maps as one of the visualization techniques. First, we will look into current problem faced by Tree structured node-link diagram. We will also look into four main types of tree-maps such as original tree-maps, Circular Tree-maps, Cushion Tree-maps and 3D Tree-maps. Finally, the effectiveness of these tree-maps to visualize the hierarchy of the directory will be investigated by conducting a simple user experiments. © 2018 The Authors.",3D Tree-Maps; Circular Tree-Maps; Cushion Tree-Maps; Tree Structure Visualization; Tree-Maps,Data visualization; Information systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3D tree; Current problems; Hierarchical structures; Node-link diagrams; Tree structures; Tree visualization; Tree-maps; Visualization technique; Forestry,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 1001/PKOMP/8012206",This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under UIR Grant,This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under RUI Grant Scheme (1001/PKOMP/8012206).,"Johnson, B., Shneiderman, B., (1991) Tree-maps: A Space-Filling Approach to the Visualization of Hierarchical Information Structures.

This problem is still greater during the software design stage, and are greater still in UML diagrams. This is principally caused because of the existence of multiple views among UML diagrams. The main issue that arise when assessing the similarity of UML diagrams from multiple views is how consistency can be maintained across different views during the comparison. Previous works have failed to address this issue. They only compare one type of diagram in one stage and another type of diagram in another stage, this manner of similarity assessment lead to incorrect similarity scores, thereby creating inconsistencies in the information conveyed by the UML artifacts during software reuse. This paper presents Multiview similarity assessment technique, in which the similarity of UML diagrams is computed from structural and behavioral views of software systems. © 2018 The Authors.",Multiview; Similarity Accessment; UML Matching Metrics,Computer software; Computer software reusability; Graphic methods; Information systems; Consistency problems; Multi-views; Multiple views; Similarity Accessment; Similarity assessment; Similarity scores; Software systems; UML Matching Metrics; Software design,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: 203/PKOMP/6711533","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS: 203/PKOMP/6711533).",,"Adamu, Zainoon, W.M.N.W., A framework for enhancing the retrieval of uml diagrams,"" software reuse: Bridging with social-awareness, g (2016) Kapitsaki and E.

As these reactions are valuable indicators for social and political well beings, we are motivated to automate the classification of news texts based on these indicators, e.g. happy, sad, angry, amused etc. Unlike other review texts that contain more explicit words which can be interpreted directly for sentiment classification, news texts mostly report facts and figures. This resulted in needs to identify whether contents of news can be exploited for classification or otherwise. Hence, in this work, a study is conducted to analyze and determine the relevant key parts of news contents that can be to be used for sentiment-based classification. Two criteria, i.e. text Part of Speech and text position, which could possible influence the training of the classifier are studied. Evaluations are conducted on the collection of 250 English news texts labelled with sentiments from sentiment voting system. The results for sentiment-based category has recorded F score of 0.422 whereas for polarity-based category has recorded F score of 0.837. The study has shown that when finer categories (e.g. happy, sad etc.) are used, the inspected criteria are less effectively; however, when these categories are based on polarity orientations, the outcomes show potentials of the proposed criteria especially for text positioned at headlines and text using adjective words. © 2018 The Authors.",News Sentiment; Text Analysis; Text Classification,Classification (of information); Information systems; Tellurium compounds; Voting machines; News content; News Sentiment; Part Of Speech; Sentiment classification; Sentiment-based classification; Text analysis; Text classification; Voting systems; Text processing,,,,,"1001/PKOMP/811335

It was accepted as a standard modeling language for visualizing, specifying and documenting software systems by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a standard specification. It contained different type of diagrams for specifying software system, among these diagrams is sequence diagrams which is used to specify the functional behavior of software system. The growing complexity of software systems is one of the motivation behind matching of UML diagrams in order to pave the way of reusing existing software to developed new software systems. Previous works on sequence diagrams matching are based on Graph representation in which there is node whenever there is message sending or received. However, the search space for these approach is very large due to the number of nodes in the graph which makes the matching computationally expensive.

However, the need for such systems goes further than just the need to convert a scanned document into a text file. There is also a need to produce a more appealing and refine reconstructed fonts. Recently, many research works in font reconstruction have shown successful and encouraging results. However, the usual way of evaluating the performance of font reconstruction is through visual inspection which is very subjective in nature, and arduous for a more perfect and objective evaluation. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a framework for an objective performance evaluation method that can be used to compare a reconstructed font with its original counterpart. Thus, it will involve studying the nature of the current and existing digital fonts and then formulate a method to compare character glyph of the created font with its corresponding original font. From this framework, it is expected that font reconstruction would be made more refine and the evaluation can be made more objective and less arduous than using the human eye, and old and rare documents can be more readily available for users in digital format with better precision in particular on tablets and other resource-constrained devices. © 2016 IEEE.",character classification; digital font reconstruction; optical character recognition,Character recognition; Optical character recognition; Character classification; Digital format; Human eye; Objective evaluation; Optical character recognition (OCR); Resourceconstrained devices; Text file; Visual inspection; Digital devices,,,,,,,,"Cutter, M.P., Van Beusekom, J., Shafait, F., Breuel, T.M., Unsupervised font reconstruction based on token co-occurrence (2010) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering DocEng'10, pp. 143-150. , (New York, NY, USA), ACM; Cutter, M.P., Van Beusekom, J., Shafait, F., Breuel, T.M., Font group identification using reconstructed fonts (2011) DRR of SPIE Proceedings, SPIE, 7874, pp. 1-10. , (G.

It has potential in improving the quality, the productivity, and reduces the overall software development cost. Reusable software components are usually kept in a components library or repository, from where they can be retrieved during reuse. In this paper we present a fast way of identifying a subset of repository models that are potentially similar to a user query prior to retrieval stage. The shortlisted repository models are then compared with the query models in a subsequent computationally demanding retrieval stage to ascertain their actual degree of similarity with the query models. Our method of selecting the subset of repository models is called Pre-filtering. This technique lead to significant reduction in retrieval time, especially when the repository contained large number of candidates solutions to be analyzed during retrieval. © 2015 IEEE.",components; models; pre-filtering; query; repository; software reuse,Models; Software design; Software engineering; components; Degree of similarity; Pre-filtering; query; repository; Reusable software components; Software artifacts; Software development costs; Computer software reusability,,,,,,,,"Prieto-Diaz, R., Status report: Software reusability (1993) Software IEEE, 10, pp. 61-66; Krueger, C.W., Software reuse (1992) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 24, pp. 131-183; Keswani, R., Joshi, S., Jatain, A., Software reuse in practice (2014) Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies (ACCT) 2014 Fourth International Conference on, pp. 159-162; Doublait, S., Standard reuse practices: Many myths vs. A reality (1997) StandardView, 5, pp. 84-91; Poulin, J.S., Measuring software reusability (1994) Software Reuse: Advances in Software Reusability 1994.

Family trees contain a lot of potential information to be explored especially for research purposes. However, many family trees fail to properly encode all necessary and useful information. Genogram therefore seems to be the most suitable visual representation of medical family tree data as it contains complex information that can be clearly presented in a diagram using genogram symbols and color-coded lines. Some limitations are problems in visualizing the wealth and complexity of the information represented once a family tree gets bigger. Hence, a new framework for exploring medical family tree data is proposed in this paper. By using genogram as a tool and a few selected visualization techniques as an enhancement in designing these new framework, which will allows users to maximize usage of data by exploring the data from several different viewpoints. This framework follows the design of advanced graphical user interface guide which is the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra “Overview first, Zoom and Filter, then Details-on Demand”, proposed by Shneiderman in 1996. Using this framework (visualization tool), it is also possible to predict health risk factors based on medical family tree data.

This paper describes our experience in designing and implementing a framework for a mobile learning application that can assist students in understanding history lesson using role-playing game (RPG) approach. The implementation is based on the narrative of a Malaysian legendary warrior, Merong Mahawangsa. This application was developed on an iOS platform and a crowd simulation technique was used in the application in order to make it more interactive and realistic. The Dijkstra shortest path algorithm was used to search the shortest path for the avatar to move around. Initial investigations suggest that applying the RPG concept has indeed provided a much better learning environment especially in helping students in learning their history lessons. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Mobile History Education; Mobile Learning; Role-playing Game,Computer science; E-learning; Interactive computer graphics; Crowd Simulation; Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm; History lesson; Learning environments; Mobile history; Mobile Learning; Mobile platform; Role-playing game; Computer aided instruction,,,,,,,,"Adams, D.M., Mayer, R.E., Macnamara, A., Koenig, A., Wainess, R., Narrative games for learning testing the discovery and narrative hypotheses (2012) Journal of Educational Psychology, 104 (1), pp. 235-249; Admiraal, W., Raessens, J., Van Zeijts, H., Technology enhanced learning through mobile technology in secondary education (2007) Knowledge Economy.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualizing the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. The two main issues that arise when comparing these data is to know how to efficiently and effectively compare phylogenetic trees, and how to visually present the results of the comparison. The primary approach is to present a new framework for tree structure visualization techniques that will display pairs of trees ""face to face"" with leaf nodes aligned. The results show that a combination of automatic and manual rearrangement is often effective in rapidly generating an arrangement that facilitates tree comparison, even for quite large trees. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Bioinformatics; Phylogenetic tree visualization; Visual comparison,Face to face; Phylogenetic trees; Tree comparison; Tree structures; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Visualization technique; Data visualization; Trees (mathematics); Bioinformatics,,,,,,,,"Hall, B.G., (2007) Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy: A How-To Manual, , Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates Inc; Munzner, T., Guimbretiere, F., Tasiran, S., Zhang, L., Zhou, Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility (2003) ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22 (3), pp. 453-462; Shneiderman, B., Tree visualization with tree-maps: A 2-D space-filling approach (1992) ACM Transactions on Graphics, 11 (1), pp. 92-99; Lamping, J., Rao, R., The hyperbolic browser: A focus + context technique for visualizing large hierarchies (1995) Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, 7 (1), pp. 33-55; Schulz, H.J., Schumann, H., Hadlak, S., Pointbased tree representation-a new approach for large hierarchies (2009) Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, pp. 81-88. , In; Stover, B., Muller, K., TreeGraph 2: Combining and visualizing evidence from different phylogenetic analyses (2010) BMC Bioinformatics, 11 (7), pp. 7-16; Wan, Z.W.M.N., Talib, A.Z., Belaton, B., (2011) A New Framework for Phylogenetic Tree Visualization, pp. 348-359. , H.

This is further compounded by the availability of myriad of choices for the user to choose from in terms of which network to connect to. Furthermore, in 4G environment, mobility scenarios are highly dynamic and current approaches tends to ignore this. Additionally, these solutions tend to focus on solving one aspect of the NSP. This paper proposes a holistic and dynamic network selection solution based on gray relational analysis (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). In order to correctly assess the context on which the network selection occurs, our method uses attributes collected from the three main stakeholders of a NSP mainly: user, mobile node and the candidate networks. Depending on the type attribute, the proposed method uses a combined method of mean value of past sessions as well as most recent value as means to collect the attribute value. This is so that past as well as current scenario is taken into consideration. Weights are assigned to these attributes indicating their relative importance. Previous approaches mostly uses quality of service requirements (QOS) of the executing application as a guide for indicating the weight. The proposed scheme not only uses QOS requirements but also combines user preference and mobile node's mobility scenario into consideration in determining the weights. Finally, ranking of the candidate networks is done using GRA. © 2012 IEEE.",,Analytical hierarchical process; Attribute values; Candidate network; Combined method; Dynamic network; Gray relational analysis; Mean values; Mobile nodes; Network selection; QoS requirements; Service requirements; Internet protocols; Quality of service; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Eason, G., Noble, B., Sneddon, I.N., On certain integrals of Lipschitz-Hankel type involving products of Bessel functions (1955) Phil.

The consumers' side of the study enables better understanding of the demands and consumers' preferences in the mobile content market. On the other hand, looking into the providers in Malaysia allows the identification of business model adopted, challenges and future trend in the market. This study takes two approaches in looking into the research problem. Selfadministrated survey is adopted in the demand side investigation which involves end-consumers, whereas qualitative interview is deployed in the supplier side investigation which involves providers of mobile contents. The findings of this study could assist the practitioner especially mobile content developers to understand the market in Malaysia, and enable them to serve their customers better. Additionally, the preliminary findings in this study can be the starting points for future empirical research that rigorously examines the mobile content market.",Market analysis; Mobile application; Mobile content; Mobile phone,Business models; Demand and supply; Demand-side; Empirical research; Future trends; Malaysia; Market analysis; Mobile applications; Mobile content; Qualitative interviews; Research problems; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Commerce,,,,,,,,"Kuang, E., (2009), China's Mobile Content Market to Top $21 billion by 2012, Hampshire, UK: Juniper Research; (2011) Mobile In Asia 2011, , http://www.aprg.com/, APRG, 4 Nov; (2011) Global ICT Developments, , http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/ict/index.html, International Telecommunication Union. 11th April; (2007) Featuring the Handphone Users Survey Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, , Annonymous, ed.3, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; Biljon, J.V., Kotz, P., Modelling the Factors That Influence Mobile Phone Adoption (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 annual research conference of the South African institute of computer scientists and information technologists on IT research in developing countries, pp. 152-161. , Port Elizabeth, South Africa; Wilska, T.-A., Mobile Phone Use as Part of Young People's Consumption Styles (2003) Journal of Consumer Policy, 26 (4), pp. 441-463; Yang, K.C.C., Exploring Factors Affecting the Adoption of Mobile Commerce in Singapore (2005) Telematics and Informatics, 22 (3), pp. 257-277; Pagani, M., Determinants of Adoption of Third Generation Mobile Multimedia Services (2004) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 18 (3), pp. 46-59; Rouvinen, P., Diffusion of Digital Mobile Telephony: Are Developing Countries Different?

Nevertheless such websites are sometimes not updated, do not provide required information or the worst case they are abandoned despite the fact that software developers have fulfilled the requirements of the users, and the systems have been deployed successfully. Hence, such websites require a dynamic web design that can delegate responsibility to each staff in ensuring the contents are always updated either to be shared among the staff or the public. This paper proposes an approach called EPISoDe that directly integrates organisations' policies as part of functional requirements in software development in this case we focus on website design and its implementation of higher learning institutions. We have deployed the proposed EPISoDe approach in a prototype called DyWeMS that provides an engine of a dynamic web design. We evaluated the approach on an official website of a school in a higher learning institution using DyWeMS dynamic engine. It implies that an organisational official website has the potential to be a one-stop information and knowledge centre that reflects organisations' history and legacy using the proposed EPISoDe approach that promotes delegation of responsibilities among the staff with the support of dynamic web design. © 2011 IEEE.",Dynamic Web Design; Official Websites; Organisations' Policy; Software Development,Functional requirement; Higher learning; Integrated approach; Official Websites; One stop; Organisations' Policy; Software developer; Web designs; Web site design; Worst case; Computer science; Computer software; Design; Gateways (computer networks); Information science; Societies and institutions; User interfaces; Websites; Software design,,,,,,,,"www.microsoft.com, accessed on November 2010; www.usm.my, accessed on November 2010; Sulaiman, S., Yusof, U.K., Sulaiman, S., A method to integrate Organisations' policies into web design (2008) The Fourth Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC'08), pp. 307-312. , Malaysia, 16-17 December; He, Q., Otto, P., Anton, A.I., Jones, L., Ensuring compliance between policies, requirements and software design: A case study (2006) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Information Assurance (IWIA'06); www.cs.usm.my, School of Computer Sciences, accessed on June 2009; www.cs.usm.my/v3, School of Computer Sciences, accessed on November 2010; Ong, C.-S., Lai, J.-Y., Wang, Y.-M., Wang, S.-W., An understanding of power issues influencing employees' acceptance of KMS: An empirical study of Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companies (2005) Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference (HICSS'05), pp. 1-10. , January; Hall, H., Input-friendliness: Motivating knowledge sharing across intranets (2001) Journal of Information Science, 27 (3), pp. 139-146; Hall, H., Goody, M., KM, culture and compromise: Interventions to promote knowledge sharing supported by technology in corporate environments (2007) Journal of Information Science, 33 (2), pp. 181-188. , DOI 10.1177/0165551506070708; Gillies, J.S., Cultural obstacles to a successful KM initiative in large law firms (2005) KMWorld & Intranets 2005 Conferences & Exposition, , San Jose, November; Moore, J.W., The Road Map to Software Engineering: A Standardsbased Guide, , John Wiley & Sons.USA; Webometrics, , www.webometrics.info, accessed on November 2010; Mambo CMS Latest Release, , http://mambofoundation.org/, accessed on November 2010; Joomla CMS, , http://www.joomla.org/, accessed on November 2010; www.ieee.org, accessed on November 2010; http://www.info.sciverse.com/scopus, accessed on November 2010","Sulaiman, S.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia; email: shahida@cs.usm.my",,IEEE Advancing Technology for Humanity;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Malaysia Computer Chapter;IEEE Malaysia;IEEE Malaysia Power Electron.

Several methods have been proposed so that unique characteristics of flowers can be extracted with increased accuracy. Establishing this process as a mobile flower identification service for the public requires major adaptation of the system due to numerous picture requests being received simultaneously. This paper presents a framework for grid-based mobile flower recognition that employs 1) grid computing technology for further optimization of multiple concurrent image processing and 2) mobile wireless communication as the primary data transfer for accessing this mobile service. Globus Toolkit is applied as the middleware in the distributed computing environment whereby Short Message Services (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) technology are used for picture and result delivery. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.,grid computing; image processingfeature extraction; mobile communication,Distributed computing environment; Flower recognition; Globus Toolkit; Grid computing technology; Grid-based; image processingfeature extraction; Mobile communications; Mobile service; Mobile wireless communications; Multimedia messaging service; Organic objects; Short message services; Data transfer; Image processing; Message passing; Middleware; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia services; Wireless telecommunication systems; Grid computing,,,,,,,,"Saitoh, T., Aoki, K., Kaneko, T., Automatic recognition of blooming flower (2004) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2004), 1, pp. 27-30; Nagy, G., Interactive, mobile, distributed pattern recognition (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3617, pp. 37-49. , DOI 10.1007/11553595-5, Image Analysis and Processing - ICIAP 2005, 13th International Conference, Proceedings; Evans, A., Sikorski, J., Thomas, P., Cha, S.-H., Tappert, C., Zhou, J., Gattani, A., Nagy, G., Computer assisted visual interactive recognition (CAVIAR) technology (2005) IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology, pp. 6-12; Kim, J.-H., Huang, R.-G., Jin, S.-H., Hong, K.-S., Mobile-based flower recognition system (2006) Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application (IITA 2009), 3, pp. 580-583; Foster, I., Zhao, Y., Raicu, I., Lu, S., Cloud computing and grid computing 360-degree compared (2008) Grid Computing Environment Workshop (GCE '08, pp. 1-10; Downton, A., Crookes, D., Parallel architecture for image processing (1998) Electronics and Communication Engineering Journal, 10 (3), pp. 139-151; Luo, S., Peng, X., Fan, S., Zhang, P., Study on computing grid distributed middleware and its application (2009) International Forum on Information Technology and Its Applications (IFITA '09), 3, pp. 441-445; Luis, F., Viktors, B., Jonathan, A., Introduction to grid computing with globus (2003) IBM Corp; Mortensen, E.N., Barrett, W., Intelligent scissors for image composition (1995) Proc. of SIGGRAPH 1995, pp. 191-198","Jaafar, M.Y.M.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 USM Pulau Pinang, Malaysia; email: mymj95956@student.usm.my",,,,"2010 International Conference on Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Applications, DFmA 2010",2 August 2010 through 3 August 2010,Yogyakarta,86073,,9.78603E+12,,,English,"Int.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualising the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. There are many research areas (such as biology, linguistics, chemistry and computer science) that use the tree as a basic data structure. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. When dealing with these sorts of data, biologists often have to deal with multiple trees generated from the same set of data. The biologists have to compare these trees in order to get a better understanding of these data. This paper aims to explore techniques to visualise the differences between two phylogenetic trees. Specifically, an application has been developed, named VCPT (Visual Comparison of Phylogenetic Trees) that implements for a new algorithm and display-based approaches that will help in visualising the similarity and differences between the phylogenetic trees. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.",Bioinformatics Visualisation; Phylogenetic Trees; Tree Structured Data,Multiple trees; Phylogenetic trees; Research areas; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Bioinformatics; Biology; Data structures; Genes; Plant extracts; Visualization; Trees (mathematics),,,,,,,,"Munzner, T., Guimbretiere, F., Tasiran, S., Zhang, L., Zhou, Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility (2003) ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22 (3), pp. 453-462. , 2003; Irwin, R., (2003) Biology Lectures: Introduction to Systematics, , http://www.utm.edu/~rirwin/391Cladistics.htm, [Online]; The willi henning society About Willi Henning, , http://www.cladistics.org/about/hennig.html, [Online]; Wan Zainon, W.N., Calder, P., Visualising phylogenetic trees (2006) Proc. 7th Australasian User Interface Conference, pp. 145-152; Maddison, D.R., The Tree of Life: Web Project, , http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html, [Online]; Lipscomb, D., (1998) Basics of Cladistic Analysis, , George Washington University, Washington D.C; Carrizo, S.F., Phylogenetic trees: An information visualisation perpective (2004) Proc. 2nd Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference, pp. 315-320; Thollesson, M., (2001) Phylogenetic Inference of Evolutionary Relationships, , http://www.lcb.uu.se/course/ugsbr/PhyloIntro.html, [Online]; Roderic, D.M., (1993) Component 2.0-User Guide, , http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/cplite/Manual.html, [Online]; Mesquite Manual, , http:/mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/manual.html, [Online]; Makarenkov, V., T-REX: Reconstructing and visualizing phylogenetic trees and reticulation networks (2001) Bioinformatics, 17 (7), pp. 664-668; Bryant, D., (1997) Building Trees, Hunting for Trees and Comparing Trees, , PhD. thesis, University of Canterbury, New Zealand; Lozano, A., Pinter, R.Y., Rokhlenko, O., Valiente, G., Ziv-Ukelson, M., Seeded tree alignment (2008) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), 5 (4), pp. 503-513; Amenta, N., Klinger, J., Case study: Visualizing sets of evolutionary trees (2002) Proc.

Our aim is to develop ways of presenting the information so as to highlight both the common structure of the trees and their points of difference. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where geneticists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. But the techniques can also be used for other treestructured data such as file systems, parse trees, decision trees, and organisational hierarchies. To investigate our techniques, we have built a prototype application that reads and displays phylogenetic trees in the popular Nexus format. The application incorporates a variety of interactive and automated visualisation techniques, and is implemented in Java. We are working with biologists to see how well the techniques work for real-world data. © 2006, Australian Computer Society, Inc.",Bioinformatics; Interactive visualisation; Phylogenetic trees,Common structures; File systems; Parse trees; Phylogenetic trees; Real world data; Tree-structured data; Bioinformatics; Decision trees; Java programming language; Trees (mathematics); Visualization; User interfaces,,,,,,,,"Carrizo, S.F., Phylogenetic Trees: An Information Visualisation Perspective (2004) Proc. 2nd Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference, , (APBC2004), Dunedin, New Zealand, Australian Computer Society, Inc; Klinger, J., Amenta, N., Case Study: Visualizing Sets of Evolutionary Trees (2002) Proc.
