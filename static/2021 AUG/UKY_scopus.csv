With the increasing number of DR cases, diabetic eye screening is a challenging task for experts. Adopting machine learning to create a high accuracy classifier will be able to reduce the burden of diabetic eye screening. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a high accuracy DR classifier using clinical attributes. This study was conducted using nine clinical attributes of 385 diabetic patients, who were already labelled regarding DR, where 79 patients did not suffer from DR (NODR), 161 patients had nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 145 patients had proliferative DR (PDR). The data was then used to develop a DR classifier through the hybrid of optimised Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiment results showed that the hybrid classifier had a high accuracy of 94.55. The accuracy yield was higher compared to single classifier. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Classification; Diabetic Retinopathy; Hybridisation; Neural Network; Support Vector Machine,Diagnosis; Eye protection; Support vector machines; Diabetic patient; Diabetic retinopathy; High-accuracy; Hybrid classifier; Hybridisation; Neural networks,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 203/PKOMP/6711802,Acknowledgement.

Many factors contribute towards a person getting a positive diagnosis such as hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level, among others. It proves to be a challenge to accurately predict the presence of a cardiovascular disease as this is a complex task. Timely and correct diagnosis is considered a highly important area in the field of clinical research and healthcare. Vast troves of data are collected by the healthcare industry every year and using this data effectively can prove to be an invaluable asset to the field. Machine learning and ensemble classification models can be employed to accurately predict heart disease in patients. Data mining techniques presented in this paper make use of patient data, from the UCI machine learning repository, to build a classification model that can be applied to new cases for the detection of heart disease. An ensemble model made from random forest and support vector machine algorithms is proposed which reports an accuracy of 89% in detecting heart disease. This model is further compared with other algorithms based on evaluation metrics like precision, recall and F-1 score. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cardiovascular disease; Ensemble classification algorithm; Machine learning,Blood vessels; Cardiology; Clinical research; Data mining; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Heart; Hospital data processing; Support vector machines; Cardio-vascular disease; Classification models; Ensemble classification; Evaluation metrics; Healthcare industry; Machine learning techniques; Support vector machine algorithm; UCI machine learning repository; Learning systems,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/8014084,Acknowledgements.

Feature selection (FS) is a typical dimensionality reduction that is used to reduce the unwanted features from the datasets. FS can be either filter or wrapper. Filters lack interaction among selected subsets of features which in turns affect the classification performance of the chosen subsets of features. This study proposes two ideas of information theory entropy (E) as well as mutual information (MI). Both of them were used together with binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm BCOA (BCOA-E and BCOA-MI) to reduce both the error rate and computational complexity on four different datasets. A support vector machine classifier was used to measure the error rates. The results are in favour of BCOA-E in terms of accuracy. In contrast, BCOA-MI is computationally faster than BCOA-E. Comparison with other approaches found in the literature shows that the proposed methods performed better in terms of accuracy, number of selected features and execution time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Binary Cuckoo optimisation; Feature selection; Filter-based; Information theory,Data mining; Dimensionality reduction; Filtration; Information theory; Optimization; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Data mining process; Error rate; Filter-based; Mutual informations; Optimisations; Support vector machine classifiers; Feature extraction,,,,,"1001/PKOMP/8014084

Advances of the financial time series forecasting had moved from traditional techniques to automated and intelligent techniques that based on machine learning and deep learning. However, many methods of automatic forecasting have been tailored to the specific nature of the time series. As such, a recently introduced Prophet model, which is based on time series decomposition, is adopted with variants of its input parameters and applied to six different financial time series data sets obtained from Standard & Poor’s 500 index (SP500), Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA), China Securities Index (CSI300), Malaysia’s stock market of Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI), Hong Kong Hang Seng 300 index (HS300) and Tokyo’s stock market of Nihon Keizai Shinbun index (Nikkei). The results of the time series forecasting show that the Prophet model is competitive in modeling the actual market movement by simply adopting appropriate parameters where the measure of Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) was 6% at most. In addition, the errors of the forecasting result are also comparable to the results of much more complex forecasting models from the literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Financial time series; Prophet; Time series forecasting,Commerce; Deep learning; Financial markets; Forecasting; Time series; Dow Jones Industrial averages; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Intelligent techniques; Mean absolute percentage error; Time series decomposition; Time series forecasting; Traditional techniques; Financial data processing,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/8014084,Acknowledgement.

As open government data (OGD) and social networking services (SNSs) have grown rapidly, OD is considered as the most significant trend for users to enhance their decision-making process. The purpose of the study was to identify the proliferation of OD in ML approaches in generating decisions through a systematic literature review (SLR) and mapping the outcomes in trends. In this systematic mapping study (SMS), the articles published between 2011 and 2020 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM, Science Direct and Ebscohost were identified and analyzed. A total of 576 articles were found but only 72 articles were included after several selection process according to SLR. The results were presented and mapped based on the designed research questions (RQs). In addition, awareness of the current trend in the OD setting can contribute to the real impact on the computing society by providing the latest development and the need for future research, especially for those dealing with the OD and ML revolution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Machine learning; Open data; Prediction; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping study,Decision making; Machine learning; Mapping; Predictive analytics; Decision making process; Latest development; Research questions; Scientific database; Social networking services; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic mapping studies; Systematic Review; Open Data,,,,,,,,"Open Knowledge Foundation. what is open data?

Hence, consider as a two objective optimisation problem. Moreover, most of the existing work treats FS as single-objective by combining the two aims into a single fitness function. As such, there is a trade-off between the number of selected features and classification performance. To create a balance between the conflicting aim of the FS and yet improve classification performance, this study proposes the use of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGAIII. Filter-based FS are scalable to large dimensional datasets and computationally fast. However, their classification performance is low because they lack feature interaction among the selected subset of features. Based on that mutual information (MI) along with entropy, are proposed as a filter-based evaluation measure along with the NSGAIII to have NSGAIIIMI and NSGAIIIE. The results obtained was compared with the existing single-objective, NSGAII as well as strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm with both MI and entropy. NSGAIII can successfully evolve the set of nondominated solutions and performs better in terms of the number of selected features, classification error rate and computational time on the majority of the datasets. © 2020 IEEE.",Entropy; Feature Selection; Filter-Based; Multi-Objective Optimization; Mutual Information; NSGAII; NSGAIII,Economic and social effects; Entropy; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Large dataset; Classification error rate; Classification performance; Evaluation measures; Feature interactions; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated solutions; Objective optimisation; Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm; Classification (of information),,,,,"Woosong University

It is becoming more challenging with an issues of highly imbalanced class. In the field of data mining, prediction or typically known as data classification problem involved detecting events. Uncommon events are hard to identify on account of their inconsistency and casualness, however, misclassifying rare events can result in heavy costs. Thus, to overcome this issues, it is suggested by few researches to overcome at the stage of pre-processing itself. One of the pre-processing methods available is sampling methods. In sampling methods, oversampling and undersampling is the most widely used techniques in imbalanced data. This paper try to investigate the performance of classification model when combining the method of oversamplings and undersampling in detecting the fraud cases from the fraud detection dataset. Few oversampling techniques is selected to combine with random undersampling techniques to undergo the process and the performance of the model is evaluate using random forest classifier and performance measure selected that is suitable for imbalanced class problem. The results obtained then compared with previous literature. From the results, the combination of oversampling and undersampling techniques gives a better precision, recall and F1-Measure value in average of 0.80%. © 2020 IEEE.",,Crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Processing; Classification models; Data classification problems; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced classification; Oversampling technique; Pre-processing method; Random forest classifier; Random under samplings; Classification (of information),,,,,"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST: :308/PKOMP/41560112

Various approaches have addressed the assembly line balancing (ALB) problem for decades. Although solving the ALB problem is crucial, a bottleneck may still occur over the next operation stages. As such, two research directions are necessary. On top of proposing an efficient search mechanism, optimum information utilization is also needed where the expected outcome would benefit both ways. Also, the utilization of problem-specific information (bottleneck identification) is expected to improve the ALB problem's solution quality. This paper provides a proof-of-concept for such claims by proposing two artificial immune systems (AIS) approaches, namely as the contagious immune network (COMET) approach, catered for the ALB problem where problem-specific information was incorporated. The proposed AIS approaches were tested on 24 ALB benchmark data sets to determine its effectiveness and highlight the impact of incorporating bottleneck identification. Also, a comparative analysis of the proposed approaches against the approaches from the literature was statistically justified. © 2020 IEEE.",,Assembly; Automatic identification; Immune system; Artificial Immune System; Assembly line balancing; Assembly line balancing problems; Bottleneck identifications; Comparative analysis; Information utilization; Manufacturing industries; Specific information; Assembly machines,,,,,"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST: 1001/PKOMP/8014084

The assembly line operations are balanced among the available resources to obtain an equal amount of workload to achieve optimum resource utilization, called the assembly line balancing (ALB) problem. Various approaches have been proposed to solve the ALB problem, which is broadly categorized as exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic approaches. Although solving the ALB problem is crucial, a bottleneck may still occur over the next operation stages. By using problem-specific information (bottleneck identification), it is expected to improve the solution quality of the ALB problem. As such, the contribution of this study is the computational method, namely as the swarm of immune cells with bottleneck identification (SIC+) approach, where both the ALB and bottleneck identification problems are addressed. In addition to the flexible problem representation, the SIC+ approach is equipped with a discrete bottleneck simulator to simulate the bottleneck scenario and bottleneck-specific operators to redistribute the machine workload of the identified bottleneck machine. The approach was tested on 24 benchmark data sets of the ALB problem, and the impact of incorporating bottleneck identification was illustrated. The experimental results show that the proposed SIC+ approach has achieved a total of 66.12% optimal solution over all instances of the benchmark data sets and has been compared with approaches from the literature where high-quality solutions were statistically justified. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Artificial immune system; Assembly line balancing problem; Manufacturing assembly operation; Shifting bottleneck; Type E objective,Assembly; Assembly machines; Balancing; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Artificial Immune System; Assembly line balancing; Assembly line balancing problems; Bottleneck identifications; High-quality solutions; Manufacturing industries; Meta-heuristic approach; Problem representation; Benchmarking,,,,,"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST: 1001/PKOMP/8014084

The most common online learning theory used in determining the learning style is the Felder-Silvermans Theory. Many researchers have proposed machine learning algorithms to establish learning style by using log file attributes. However, they did not optimize the parameters selections which also contribute to low performance matrices. In this paper, tree-based algorithm is being used to detect the learning style of the user. The tree-based algorithms used in this paper are the Decision Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgb). In order to optimize the results of the performance matrices, the parameters of the tree-based algorithm classifiers are optimized by using the grid search hyper-parameter optimization.

These aims are conflicting with one another, and a choice must be made in the presence of the trade-off between them. Numerous researches deal with feature selection problem but, they are mostly single-objective based. Nowadays, multi-objective optimisation approaches are becoming the most suitable approaches to deal with feature selection problems. They can easily create a balance between selected features and classification accuracy or error rate. Evolutionary computation techniques have been applied for multi-objective feature selection. Cuckoo optimisation algorithm is among the most popular technique that is exceptional in solving the problems of feature selection. Based on the binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm, two different multi-objective filter-based feature selection frameworks are presented with the idea of nondominated sorting genetic algorithms NSGAIII (BCNSG3) along with NSGAII (BCNSG2). Thus, four multi-objective filter-based feature selection approaches are proposed by employing mutual information along with gain ratio based-entropy as the respective filter evaluation measures in all the proposed frameworks. The results obtained are examined and analysed against the existing methods and single objective scheme on fourteen (14) datasets of varying degree of difficulties. The outcome of the experiments displays that the proposed multi-objective algorithms successfully derive a set of nondominated solutions that used the least feature size and attained the best error rate than using full-length features. In general, BCNSG2 obtained the best results compared to the existing methods and single-objective algorithm, whereas BCNSG3 outdoes all other approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",Cuckoo optimization algorithm; gain ratio based-entropy; machine learning and classification; multi-objective feature selection; mutual information; NSGA II; NSGA III,Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Evolutionary computation techniques; Feature selection problem; Multi objective algorithm; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated solutions; Optimization algorithms; Feature extraction,,,,,"Woosong University: 1001/PKOMP/8014084

Learning style of specific users in an online learning system is determined based on their interaction and behavior towards the system. The most common online learning theory used in determining the learning style is the Felder-Silverman’s Learning Style Model (FSLSM). Many researchers have proposed machine learning algorithms to establish learning style by using the log file attributes. This helps in determining the learning style automatically. However, current researches still perform poorly, where the range of accuracy is between 58%-89%. Hence, RF(Xgb) is proposed to help in improving the learning style prediction. This hybrid algorithm was further enhanced by optimizing its parameters. From the experiments, RF(Xgb) was proven to be more effective, with accuracy of 96% compared to J48 and LSID-ANN algorithm from previous literature. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Diabetic eye screening has become a challenging task for ophthalmologist as they need to deal with large number of patients to be diagnosed, creating a need to develop tool that may help ophthalmologist to classify the severity of DR in order to establish an adequate therapy. Previous researchers have studied machine learning to propose an automatic DR classification using the clinical variables. However, it needs to be improvised especially in terms of accuracy. Hence, this paper aims to propose an optimal or near-optimal DR classifier using the Support Vector Machine with hyperparameter optimization. This study considered three classes of diabetic patients which were patients who do not have DR (NODR), patients with non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and patients with proliferative DR (PDR), instead of focusing only on two classes (NO DR, DR). The radial basis function, polynomial, sigmoid kernel and their respective hyperparameters were tested in this study in order to find the best kernel and combination of hyperparameters that can improve the performance of SVM. The results obtained show that SVM-radial kernel with cost value,64, 0.03 gives the best accuracy at 85.45%. © 2019 International Center for Scientific Research and Studies.",Classification; Diabetic retinopathy; Hyperparameter; Optimization; Support vector machine,,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM

Various emotions are observed during emergency such as panic, fear, sad and anxiety which will lead to the behaviour and trajectories during the evacuation. Even there are many studies of computational simulation model which focus on crowd behavioural, yet there are still gaps of real evacuation due to the scarcity of real data and mostly assumption is made on the simulated model. In this paper, investigation on how the key emotions turn into behaviour are studied from the real emergency video. The key emotions extracted are panic and confuse which is observed from the real emergency video. These emotions are then map to psychological theories adopt from Lazarus Theory of emotions and stress. Due to the uncertainties in human behaviour, fuzzy approach is chosen to map linguistic value to speed (numerical) which will then lead to behavioural results.

The common lead time estimation mostly applied with knowledge-based approaches, but most of them have focused on supervised regression task to predict continuous lead time, which somehow only predicts the product lead time without identifying the critical lengthy manufacturing process. This paper aims to predict the manufacturing lead time of a product with supervised machine learning approach through classification of lead time in time range duration and able to identify the lengthy manufacturing product lead time. The machine learning model are developed with support vector machine algorithm using production and work order data as the model input. The target class is the total duration of product manufacturing time discretized into category attribute with different range of duration. The dataset extracted from work order and production data source and merge into a full dataset. Data preprocessing and feature engineering were applied to clean the dataset and boost the feature set to have 81 features in total. The final feature set was selected using recursive feature elimination approach feature selection technique. The final model applied support vector machine algorithm to perform the classification task and compared with Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network for performance.

However, the reasons that distinguish the winning and losing positions remain actively researched which leads to the utilization of the search “indicator”. Conspiracy number search (CNS) and proof number search (PNS) had been popularly adopted as the search indicators in MIN/MAX and AND/OR tree, respectively. However, their limitations had encouraged the need for an alternative search indicator. The single conspiracy number (SCN) is a search indicator inspired by CNS and PNS which measure the difficulty of getting MIN/MAX value over a threshold point for a current root node. Recently, SCN had been successfully applied in Chinese chess to analyze both the progress pattern and long-term position. In this paper, analysis of the SCN within the game of checkers is conducted where different SCN threshold values and varying depth of the search tree were considered. Checkers was chosen due to its smaller search space and contain a rule that affects the shape of the search tree. The experimental results show that the SCN values stabilize as the depth of the search tree increases whether the player is in winning, drawing or losing position.

However, this is because the default medical diagnostic techniques are not affordable by common people. This inspires many researchers to rescue the situation by using soft computing and machine learning approaches to bring a halt to the situation. These approaches use the medical data of the patients to predict the presence of the disease or not. Although, most of these data contains some redundant and irrelevant features that need to be discarded to enhance the prediction accuracy. As such, feature selection has become necessary to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce the number of features. In this study, two different but related cuckoo inspired algorithms, cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA), are proposed for feature selection on some heart disease datasets. Both the algorithms used the general filter method during subset generation. The obtained results showed that CSA performed better than COA both concerning fewer number of features as well as prediction accuracy on all the datasets. Finally, comparison with the state of the art approaches revealed that CSA also performed better on all the datasets. © 2018, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

In a planning context, this triggers the need for an evacuation situation that involves the emergency route planning (ERP) problem. ERP emphasizes the effectiveness of the evacuation plan to mitigate risk and ensure crowd safety. Reviews on previous ERP works have elicited a plethora of approaches, such as decision support, exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic approaches. However, previous works on ERP focused on either crowd modeling techniques or routing approaches, but not both. This elicits the need to bridge modeling and routing approaches by means of a dynamic concept. To capture this dynamism concept, group cohesiveness and flexible routing approaches have been proposed, namely as an integrated evacuation planning with dynamism (iEvaP+). Group cohesiveness is utilized by considering group structure and intra-group compliance. Meanwhile, an artificial immune system (AIS) algorithm is adopted as the route optimizer. The iEvaP+ approach is applied to three case studies in order to identify the impact of crowd dynamism in the ERP problem. The result indicates that dynamism has direct influence on the evacuation plan performance.

This includes cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of academic courses taken, co-curriculum involvement, soft skills, hard work, leadership, attitude, time management, attendance, attire, and technical skill in order to make the selection decision. The distinctive student is identified firstly based on their overall score. The problem arises when one needs to evaluate all these different criteria in order to select or nominated a model student. It is a tedious task and time consuming for examiner or reviewer to analyze students individually in order to select a student that showed desirable performance. In addition, as a human has its limitation, there is a high degree of error in judgment in decision making. With the aim of bridging this gap, fuzzy logic is applied to imitate human analytic thinking or the ability to make a decision in the model student selection process. Thus, the system is able to assist examiner or evaluator in the decision-making process of determining the model student with minimal time and error. Furthermore, the user could dynamically change the criteria based on the traits that have been set by the system. Fuzzy logic is chosen as it is a powerful mathematical tool involving ambiguous and incomplete information supported by the experience and judgment of examiner or reviewer while combining this cognitive ability in order to reach a verdict. Therefore, the outputs from the experiment conducted shows that the system provides robust output and information to the user regarding student's aptitude and ultimately aim to effectively predict human judgment. © 2016 IEEE.",,Computer circuits; Decision making; Education; Fuzzy logic; Cumulative grade point averages; Decision making process; Educational institutions; Fuzzy logic reasoning; Incomplete information; Mathematical tools; Selection decisions; Student selections; Students,,,,,,,,"Petrudi, S.H.J., Pirouz, M., Pirouz, B., Application of fuzzy logic for performance evaluation of academic students (2013) 2013 13th Iranian Conference on Fuzzy Systems (IFSC); Kharola, A., Kunwar, S., Choudhury, G.B., Students performance evaluation: A fuzzy logic reasoning approach (2015) PM World Journal, 4, pp. 1-11; Gokmen, G., Akinci, T.C.C., Tektaş, M., Onat, N., Kocyigit, G., Tektaş, N., Evaluation of student performance in laboratory applications using fuzzy logic (2010) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 902-909; Deliktas, D., Ustun, O., Student selection and assignment methodology based on fuzzy multimoora and multichoice goal programming (2015) International Transactions in Operational Research; Gardner, A.K., Ritter, E.M., Paige, J.T., Ahmed, R.A., Fernandez, G., Dunkin, B.J., Simulation-based selection of surgical trainees: Considerations, challenges, and opportunities (2016) Journal of the American College of Surgeons; Razack, S., Hodges, B., Steinert, Y., Maguire, M., Seeking inclusion in an exclusive process: Discourses of medical school student selection (2015) Medical Education, 49 (1), pp. 36-47; Schaeperkoetter, C.C., Bass, J.R., Gordon, B.S., Student-athlete school selection: A family systems theory approach (2015) Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, 8 (2); Tavana, M., Azizi, F., Azizi, F., Behzadian, M., A fuzzy inference system with application to player selection and team formation in multiplayer sports (2013) Sport Management Review, 16 (1), pp. 97-110; Tseng, T.-L.B., Huang, C.-C., Chu, H.-W., Gung, R.R., Novel approach to multi-functional project team formation (2004) International Journal of Project Management, 22 (2), pp. 147-159; Strnad, D., Guid, N., A fuzzy-genetic decision support system for project team formation (2010) Applied Soft Computing, 10 (4), pp. 1178-1187; Mamdani, E.H., Assilian, S., An experiment in linguistic synthesis with a fuzzy logic controller (1975) International Journal of Man-machine Studies, 7 (1), pp. 1-13; Takagi, T., Sugeno, M., Fuzzy identification of systems and its applications to modeling and control (1985) Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, (1), pp. 116-132; Kaehler, S., Fuzzy logic tutorial.

The human emotional transition between normal to panic state is due to extreme event which is beyond control. In the past, crowd behavior models for emergency evacuation being studied are aircraft emergency evacuation, emotional ant based, behavior based real time evacuation and many more which is related to the behavior and life like. They are different types of approached used to model crowd to be the same as the real world such as mathematical and heuristic approaches. Mathematical approach is accurate however in modelling human behaviour which is complex in terms of behavior (emotions), cognitive and appraisal, heuristic approach is preferred. In defining human behavior (emotions) in a real world, fuzzy logic approach is chosen to be incorporated into an intelligent agent based on emotions and stress theory. Within this paper we intend to outline our proposed model with extracting data from the real world video into fuzzy rules in producing real life crowd evacuation modelling. © 2016 IEEE.",,Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Heuristic methods; Human computer interaction; Social sciences; Aircraft emergency evacuations; Crowd evacuation; Emergency evacuation; Fuzzy logic approach; Heuristic approach; Human behaviours; Mathematical approach; Real world videos; Behavioral research,,,,,,,,"Connor, D.J.O., Integrating human behavior factors into design an examination of behaviors that increase or reduce harm from fires (2005) Fire Protection Engineering, 28, p. 8; Shields, T., Proulx, G., The science of human behaviour: Past research endeavours, current developments and fashioning a research agenda (2000) Fire Safety Science, 6, pp. 95-113; Proulx, G., Richardson, J., The human factor: Building designers often forget how important the reactions of the human occupants are when they specify fire and life safety systems (2002) Canadian Consulting Engineer, 43 (3), pp. 35-36; Galea, E., Pedestrian and evacuation dynamics (2003) Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics, , London, UK, CMC Press; Santos, G., Aguirre, B.E., (2004) A Critical Review of Emergency Evacuation Simulation Models; Wang, C., Li, C., Liu, Y., Cui, J., Zhang, T., Behavior-based simulation of real-time crowd evacuation (2011) Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics (CAD/Graphics), 2011 12th International Conference On.

Disaster is an unplanned situation that can happen anywhere and anytime. The worst case is when disasters happen on large gatherings which can increase risk of death during egress evacuation. When an emergency arises, crowds will evacuate to the nearest exit they know of. There are many risks involved during an emergency when it is unplanned. Research on crowd evacuation pay less attention to the realism of crowd behavioural factors which influence the evacuation result. As such this has prompted a novel crowd evacuation model as a potential solution for realistic crowd behavioural evacuation modelling through a combination of crowd behaviour, evacuation planning and path finding. © 2015 IEEE.",crowd behaviour evacuation modelling; Emergency evacuation; evacuation plan; path finding,Disasters; Software engineering; Crowd evacuation; Emergency evacuation; Emergency events; Evacuation modelling; Evacuation planning; Evacuation plans; Natural disasters; Path finding; Behavioral research,,,,,,,,"Chu, M.L., Parigi, P., Law, K., Latombe, I.-C., Safegress: A flexible platform to study the effect of human and social behaviors on egress performance (2014) Proceedings of the Symposium on Simulation for Architecture & Urban Design, p. 4. , Society for Computer Simulation International; Aguirre, B.E., Torres, M.R., Gill, K.B., Lawrence Hotchkiss, H., Normative collective behavior in the station building fire∗ (2011) Social Science Quarterly, 92 (1), pp. 100-118; Sharma, S., Simulation and modeling of group behavior during emergency evacuation (2009) Intelligent Agents 2009.

However, establishing eﬀective manufacturing assembly line operations, in a dynamic manufacturing setting is essentially dependent upon optimum resource utilization while fulﬁlling various constraints and requirements. Consequently, balancing the resources in the assembly line is a complex combinatorial problem, which if not eﬃciently managed, may entail signiﬁcant costs. As such, to facilitate the nature of the assembly line in manufacturing, a new methodology is needed. Bio-inspired methods have been popularly adopted in assembly line where several real-world problems have been successfully solved. Distributed and autonomous paradigm oﬀered by the multi-agent system (MAS) is conducive for addressing the complexity of the manufacturing assembly line. As MAS lacks a self-organization aspect, integration of bio-inspired methods within the MAS paradigm are envisioned, where adaptive and self-organization characteristics are the key ingredients to promote robustness; thus creating a potentially self-reliant and versatile manufacturing environment. © 2016 ICIC International.",Assembly line; Bio-inspired method; Multi-agent system,Assembly; Assembly machines; Autonomous agents; Manufacture; Assembly line; Bio-inspired methods; Complex combinatorial problem; Customized products; Manufacturing assembly; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing industries; Resource utilizations; Multi agent systems,,,,,,,,"Leitao, P., (2009) Holonicrationaleandbio-Inspirationondesignofcomplexemergentandevolvablesystems, Trans.

Planning a suitable evacuation route and identifying the shortest evacuation route before the occurrence of extreme events are crucial for an effective evacuation process. Although evacuation plans can be orchestrated in advance, probable crowd dynamics, especially group-based characteristics (e.g. group formation, group relation, group competition, etc.), may occur, rendering unfeasible evacuation plan. Therefore, creating a dynamic and effective emergency route planning (ERP) approach is important for crowd survivability. There are number of ERP approaches have been proposed, which includes mathematical-based approach, heuristic-driven approach, and meta-heuristic approach. Although the meta-heuristic approaches are capable of handling dynamic constraints and produces optimum result, its lack of adoption in the domain of ERP problem serve as an encouragement of applying this approach. Therefore, an integrated evacuation planning approach with dynamism (iEvaP+) is proposed to cater the dynamic of groups in crowd and optimizing the route selection, where the use of immune-based meta-heuristic approach had effectively produces statistically significant results (p-value < 0.5 significance level) against an approach proposed by [1]. © 2015 IEEE.",artificial immune system; crowd dynamic; crowd modeling; emergency evacuation; emergency route planning,Big data; Computer software; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Software engineering; Artificial Immune System; Crowd dynamics; Crowd modeling; Emergency evacuation; Emergency route; Optimization,,,,,,,,"Lu, Q., Huang, Y., Shekhar, S., Evacuation planning: A capacity constrained routing approach (2003) Intelligence and Security Informatics, pp. 111-125. , Springer; Chiu, Y.-C., Zheng, H., Villalobos, J., Gautam, B., Modeling nonotice mass evacuation using a dynamic traffic flow optimization model (2007) IIE Transactions, 39 (1), pp. 83-94; Alsnih, R., Stopher, P.R., Review of procedures associated with devising emergency evacuation plans (2004) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1865 (1), pp. 89-97; Saeed Osman, M., Ram, B., Evacuation route scheduling using discrete time-based capacity-constrained model (2011) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM), 2011 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 161-165. , IEEE; Yersin, B., Maïm, J., Morini, F., Thalmann, D., Real-time crowd motion planning (2008) The Visual Computer, 24 (10), pp. 859-870; Radianti, J., Granmo, O.-C., Bouhmala, N., Sarshar, P., Yazidi, A., Gonzalez, J., Crowd models for emergency evacuation: A review targeting human-centered sensing (2013) System Sciences (HICSS), 2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on, pp. 156-165. , IEEE; Wang, P., Luh, P.B., Chang, S.-C., Marsh, K.L., Efficient optimization of building emergency evacuation considering social bond of evacuees (2009) Automation Science and Engineering 2009.

However, focus on an effective search program is insufficient to give the “taste” of actual entertainment in the gaming industry. Instead of focusing on effective search algorithm, we dedicate our study in realizing the possibility of applying strategy changing technique. However, quantifying and determining this possibility is the main challenge imposed in this study. For this purpose, the Conspiracy Number Search algorithm is considered where the maximum and minimum conspiracy numbers are recorded in the test bed of simple Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello game application. We analysed these numbers as the measures of critical position identifier which determines the right moment for possibility of applying strategy changing technique. For Tic-Tac-Toe game, the conspiracy numbers are analysed through operators formally defined in this article as ↑ tactic and ↓ tactic while variance of the conspiracy numbers are analysed in Othello game. Interesting results are obtained with convincing evidences but future works are still needed in order to further strengthen our hypothesis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Conspiracy numbers; Othello; Tic-Tac-Toe,Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Conspiracy numbers; Critical positions; Othello; Perfect informations; Search Algorithms; Tic-Tac-Toe; Tic-Tac-Toe game; Computer games,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: number26540189","This research is funded by a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, in the framework of the Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research (grant number26540189).",,"van den Herik, H.J., Donkers, H., Spronck, P.H., Opponent modelling and commercial games (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG05), pp. 15-25; Iida, H., Uiterwijk, J., van den Herik, H.J., Herschberg, I., Potential applications of opponent-model search: Part 1 (1993) The domain of applicability.

Planning a suitable evacuation route and identifying the shortest evacuation route before the occurrence of extreme events are crucial for risk mitigation. Probable crowd dynamics, especially group-based characteristics (e.g., group formation, group relation, and group competition), may occur, often rendering evacuation plan unfeasible. Previously, several emergency route planning (ERP) approaches have been proposed which can be categorized as mathematical, heuristic, and meta-heuristic. Reduction in the computational complexity and optimum solution generation of the meta-heuristic approach has inspired the adoption of an immune-based approach, namely an integrated evacuation planning with dynamism (iEvaP+) approach, to cater crowd grouping while optimizing the route selection. Two case studies have been considered to evaluate the iEvaP+ approach effectiveness, where four out of six test cases had obtained statistically different results (p-value ≤ 0.026067) against the approach proposed by Jiang et al. © 2015 ICIC International.",Crowd grouping; Dynamic models; Emergency evacuation; Emergency route planning; Immune-based algorithms,Dynamic models; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Crowd grouping; Emergency evacuation; Emergency response; Emergency route; Evacuation planning; Group competitions; Immune-based approach; Meta-heuristic approach; Optimization,,,,,,,,"Jiang, T., Ren, G., Zhao, X., Evacuation route optimization based on tabu search algorithm and hill-climbing algorithm (2013) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 96, pp. 865-872; Radianti, J., Granmo, O.-C., Sarshar, P., Goodwin, M., Dugdale, J., Gonzalez, J.J., A spatiotemporal probabilistic model of hazard- and crowd dynamics for evacuation planning in disasters (2015) Applied Intelligence, 42 (1), pp. 3-23; Hsu, Y.-T., Peeta, S., An aggregate approach to model evacuee behavior for no-notice evacuation operations (2013) Transportation, pp. 1-26; Qiu, F., Hu, X., Modeling group structures in pedestrian crowd simulation (2010) Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 18 (2), pp. 190-205; Zeng, M., Wang, C., Evacuation route planning algorithm: Longer route preferential, Advances in Neural Networks (2009) Springer, pp. 1062-1071; Lv, Y., Huang, G., Sun, W., Chao, D., A scenario-based modeling approach for emergency evacuation management and risk analysis under multiple uncertainties (2012) Journal of Hazardous Materials; Campos, V., Bandeira, R., Bandeira, A., A method for evacuation route planning in disaster situations (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 54, pp. 503-512; Massink, M., Latella, D., Bracciali, A., Harrison, M.D., Hillston, J., Scalable context-dependent analysis of emergency egress models (2012) Formal Aspects of Computing, 24 (2), pp. 267-302; Zhang, F., Liu, M., Zhou, Z., Shen, W.-M., Quantum ant colony algorithm-based emergency evacuation path choice algorithm (2013) IEEE the 17Th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, pp. 576-580; Chiu, Y.-C., Zheng, H., Villalobos, J., Gautam, B., Modeling no-notice mass evacuation using a dynamic traffic flow optimization model (2007) IIE Transactions, 39 (1), pp. 83-94; De Francca, F.O., Von Zuben, F.J., A dynamic artificial immune algorithm applied to challenging benchmarking problems (2009) IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, pp. 423-430; Lau, H.Y., Wong, V.W., An immunity approach to strategic behavioral control (2007) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 20 (3), pp. 289-306; De Castro, L.N., Timmis, J., Artificial immune systems as a novel soft computing paradigm (2003) Soft Computing, 7 (8), pp. 526-544; McEwan, C., Hart, E., Clonal selection from first principles, Artificial Immune Systems (2010) Springer, pp. 18-32; Freschi, F., Repetto, M., Multiobjective optimization by a modified artificial immune system algorithm, Artificial Immune Systems (2005) Springer, pp. 248-261; Bagheri, A., Zandieh, M., Mahdavi, I., Yazdani, M., An artificial immune algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (2010) Future Generation Computer Systems, 26 (4), pp. 533-541; Moreland, R.L., Levine, J., Wingert, M., Creating the ideal group: Composition effects at work (2013) Understanding Group Behavior, 2, pp. 11-35; Liu, S., Yang, L., Fang, T., Li, J., Evacuation from a classroom considering the occupant density around exits (2009) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 388 (9), pp. 1921-1928; Ibrahim, M., Abdul-Hamid, K., Ibrahim, M., Mohd-Din, A., Yunus, R., Yahya, M., The development of fire risk assessment method for heritage building (2011) Procedia Engineering, 20, pp. 317-324",,,,ICIC Express Letters Office,,,,,1881803X,,,,English,ICIC Express Lett.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947283817

Most manufactured products usually have a very short life cycle. These scenarios imply the need to improve the efficiency of capacity planning, an important aspect of the machine allocation plan known for its complexity. Various studies have been performed to balance productivity and flexibility in the flexible manufacturing system (FMS). Many approaches have been developed by the researchers to determine the suitable balance between exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). However, not much work has been focused on the domain of machine allocation problem that considers the effects of machine breakdowns. This paper develops a model to minimize the effect of machine breakdowns, thus increasing the productivity. The objectives are to minimize system unbalance and makespan as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed model, results for throughput, system unbalance and makespan on real industrial datasets were performed with applications of intelligence techniques, that is, a hybrid of genetic algorithm and harmony search. The result aims to obtain a feasible solution to the domain problem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Machine shop practice; Manufacture; Productivity; Semiconductor device manufacture; Capacity planning; Feasible solution; Industrial machines; Machine allocation; Machine breakdown; Manufactured products; Semiconductor industry; Technological constraints; Flexible manufacturing systems,,,,,,,,"Huang, D., Yan, J., Qiao, F., (2004) 8th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, 3, pp. 2217-2222; Nanvala, H.B., Awari, G.K., (2011) International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 3, pp. 64-73; Pongcharoen, P., Hicks, C., Braiden, P.M., (2004) European Journal of Operational Research, 152, pp. 215-225; Kumar, A., Prakash, Tiwari, M.K., Shankar, R., Baveja, A., (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175, pp. 1043-1069; Geem, Z., (2006), Improved Harmony Search from Ensemble of Music Players (Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol 4251) (Springer Berlin / Heidelberg); Al-Betar, M., Khader, A., (2012) Annals of Operations Research, 194, pp. 3-31; Geem, Z.W., Kim, J.H., Loganathan, G., (2001) SIMULATION, 76, pp. 60-68; Mukhopadhyay, A., Roy, A., Das, S., Abraham, A., (2008) Third International Conference on Digital Information Management, 2008.

As such, optimizing the evacuation operations during an emergency situation would require an effective crowd evacuation plan, which is acknowledged to be one of the vital studies of the societal research as well as emergency route planning (ERP) community. Several descriptions of prior developed approaches for emergency evacuation that encompassed the needs of a variety of public community as well as fulfilling the complexity of the situation, are summed up and discussed. This paper introduces an immune algorithm (IA) to optimize the evacuation plan for solving the ERP problems. The approach is first validated against previous work while further experimentation reveals the effectiveness of the proposed IA, with regard to certain parameter calibrations, in the context of ERP problems. The findings have been summarized and presented, whereas the potential for future work is identified.",Emergency evacuation; Emergency route planning; Immune algorithm,Oil spills; Artificial immune; Emergency evacuation; Emergency evacuation route planning; Emergency route; Emergency situation; Immune algorithms; Parameter calibration; Public communities; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,"Alsnih, R., Stopher, P.R., Review of procedures associated with devising emergency evacuation plans (2004) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1865 (1), pp. 89-97; Bagheri, A., Zandieh, M., Mahdavi, I., Yazdani, M., An artificial immune algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (2010) Future Generation Computer Systems, 26 (4), pp. 533-541; Carron, A.V., Brawley, L.R., Cohesion conceptual and measurement issues (2000) Small Group Research, 31 (1), pp. 89-106; Cepolina, E.M., A methodology for defining building evacuation routes (2005) Civil Engineering and Environmental Systems, 22 (1), pp. 29-47; Dasgupta, D., Yu, S., Nino, F., Recent advances in artificial immune systems: Models and applications (2011) Applied Soft Computing, 11 (2), pp. 1574-1587; Hajibabai, L., Delavar, M., Malek, M., Frank, A., Agent-based simulation of spatial cognition and wayfinding in building fire emergency evacuation (2007) Geomatics Solutions for Disaster Management, pp. 255-270. , Springer; Hui, F., Zi, Z., Gang, H., Developing a model for the emergency rescue routing problem using stochastic programming theory (2010) Logistics Engineering and Intelligent Transportation Systems (LEITS), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 1-4. , IEEE; Kim, S., George, B., Shekhar, S., Evacuation route planning: Scalable heuristics (2007) Proceedings of the 15th Annual ACM International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, p. 20. , ACM; Li, Q., Fang, Z., Li, Q., Zong, X., Multiobjective evacuation route assignment model based on genetic algorithm (2010) Geoinformatics, 2010 18th International Conference on, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Lu, Q., Huang, Y., Shekhar, S., Evacuation planning: A capacity constrained routing approach (2003) Intelligence and Security Informatics, pp. 111-125. , Springer; Lv, Y., Huang, G., Sun, W., Chao, D., A scenario-based modeling approach for emergency evacuation management and risk analysis under multiple uncertainties (2012) Journal of Hazardous Materials; Sayyady, F., Eksioglu, S.D., Optimizing the use of public transit system during no-notice evacuation of urban areas (2010) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 59 (4), pp. 488-495; Wang, P., Luh, P.B., Chang, S.-C., Sun, J., Modeling and optimization of crowd guidance for building emergency evacuation (2008) Automation Science and Engineering, 2008.

However, quantifying and determining this possibility is the main challenge imposed in this study. For this purpose, the Conspiracy Number Search algorithm is considered where the maximum and minimum conspiracy numbers are recorded in the test bed of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game application. We analyze these numbers as the measures of critical position identifier which determines the right moment for possibility of applying speculative play through operators formally defined in this article as ↑ tactic and ↓ tactic.

Two main colour transformation algorithms namely the Daltonize and RGB-HSV algorithm are compared to see the differences. The RGB-HSV algorithm was then selected to improve the colour contrast of the transformed images. The proposed algorithm from RGB colour space to HSV colour space focuses on the brightness of red and blue colours where red is modified to light red while green is modified to dark blue. The modified algorithm is named as RGB-HSV (B), whereby the ‘B’ is referring to brightness. RGB-HSV (B) is then tested on a group of 12colour deficient individuals via a designed questionnaire handed out to them. The process of modification involves 4 different values of colour range.

In order to mitigate the probable risks, emergency routes need to be properly planned and managed. As such, this has prompted crowd guidance as one of the main solutions for emergency route planning and management. Optimization algorithms have been an essential part of any crowd guidance. Trends of the optimization algorithms have been thoroughly reviewed based on the three components of emergency route planning and management: network or route (resource), affected crowd (demand), and critical event (disaster). Various optimization algorithms have been developed and implemented ranging from mathematical, decision support system, heuristics, meta-heuristics, and others. The review has revealed that most optimization algorithms lack several features which are vital in an emergency evacuation problem, enabling it to be scalable, practical, and reliable. Additionally, limitations of the existing optimization algorithms in the context of emergency route planning and management have also been identified based on the three aforementioned components. Future outlooks for crowd guidance solution in the field of emergency route planning and management are discussed and presented. © 2015, ICIC International.",Algorithms; Emergency evacuation; Route planning and management,Artificial intelligence;

The objective of this strategy is to produce optimum maintenance times for system components. The island model is used to divide the total population into smaller sub populations, where for each island, a harmony search is used to find the optimal maintenance cost. To test the system, a data set for maintenance based on replacement policy was used. The test results from the data set were compared to those obtained from a general gradient with branch and bound (GRG with BB), simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA). From the results, it concludes that the island-HS had improved the cost compared to GA and SA and was close to the exact optimal value obtained from GRG with BB algorithm. © 2015, ICIC International.",Harmony search; Island model; Maintenance cost optimization,Algorithms; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Simulated annealing; Statistical tests; Harmony search; Harmony search algorithms; Island model; Maintenance cost optimization; Optimal maintenance; Optimization strategy; Replacement policy; System components; Maintenance,,,,,,,,"Gertsbakh, I., (2005) Handbook of Reliability Engineering, , Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin; Sortrakul, N., Nachtmann, H.L., Cassady, C.R., Genetic algorithms for integrated preventive maintenance planning and production scheduling for a single machine (2005) Computers in Industry, 56 (2), pp. 161-168; Mirabedini, N., Iranmanesh, H., A scheduling model for serial jobs on parallel machines with different preventive maintenance (pm) (2014) Int.

The recent trend in globalization has led to an egression of distributed, unique, and independent units of production centers. The FMS in a distributed system (FMSDS) is considered as a multi-factory environment, where jobs are processed by FMSs. Problems in FMSDS are related to the allocation of jobs to factories, independent assignment of job operation of machines, and operations sequencing on the machine. In addition, impact of the maintenance as one of the core parts of production scheduling has been previously neglected, thereby affecting the overall performance of the production schedule. Hence, this work considers maintenance as part of production scheduling. The objective of this study is to minimize the global makespan throughout the multi-factory network. This paper proposes a modified chemical reaction optimization algorithm to solve the problems in FMSDS. The molecule encoding explicitly represents the information on the factory, job, and maintenance; whereas a greedy decoding procedure exploits flexibility and determines job routing. An improvised crossover operator is used to improve the solutions by refining the most promising individuals of each generation. The proposed approach is compared with other algorithms, and algorithm performance is tested with several parameter refinements. Satisfactory results were achieved where about 1% to 26% deviations are observed when compared to other algorithms. The contribution of the study and the potential future works has also been discussed. © 2015 ICIC International.",Chemical reaction optimization; Distributed system; Flexible manufacturing system; Machine maintenance;

The importance of satisfying customer demands and achieving higher profits have increased the attention towards production scheduling in semiconductor assembly areas. Combination of productivity and flexibility provided by semiconductor assembly areas have attracted many research efforts for several years. Additionally, recent globalization events have encouraged decentralized efforts in the semiconductor assembly industry by implementing distributed systems. With respect to the previously mentioned problems, several approaches have been introduced namely Petri nets, Ant Colony, Genetic Algorithm, Intelligent Agents, and hybrids of the latter. A new model, using artificial immune system (AIS) algorithm, slightly modified to conform to the manufacturing constraints, has been proposed and tested with an industrial dataset to establish its effectiveness. AIS algorithm is chosen due to its inherent self-learning capability and memory incubation features. The results from the experiments conducted show that the proposed algorithm is effective for the aforementioned problems where the production schedule efficiency increased from 30% to 60%. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial immune system; distributed production scheduling; Semiconductor industry,Ant colony optimization; Genetic algorithms; Immune system; Intelligent agents; Petri nets; Production control; Scheduling; Semiconductor device manufacture; Systems analysis; Artificial Immune System; Artificial immune system algorithms; Distributed productions; Manufacturing constraint; Production Scheduling; Self-learning capability; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor industry; Assembly,,,,,,,,"Yusof, U.K., Deris, S., Budiarto, R., Machine aUocation optimization in semiconductor assembly industry using a hybrid of bio-inspired and musical-harmony approach (2013) The 7th International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC2012); Lee, D.Y., Dicesare, F., Scheduling flexible manufacturing systems using petri nets and heuristic search (1994) Robotics and Automation, IEEE Transactions on, 10 (2), pp. 123-132; Prakash, A., Khilwani, N., Tiwari, M., Cohen, Y., Modified immune algorithm for job selection and operation allocation problem in flexible manufacturing systems (2008) Advances in Engineering Software, 39 (3), pp. 219-232; Chan, F., Chan, H., Lau, H., The state of the art in simulation study on fms scheduling: A comprehensive survey (2002) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 19 (11), pp. 830-849; Reyes, A., Yu, H., Kelleher, G., Lloyd, S., Integrating petri nets and hybrid heuristic search for the scheduling of fms (2002) Computers in Industry, 47 (1), pp. 123-138; Kumar, R., Tiwari, M., Shankar, R., Scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems: An ant colony optimization approach (2003) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering ManufaclUre, 217 (10), pp. 1443-1453; Jia, H., Fuh, J.Y., Nee, A.Y., Zhang, Y., Integration of genetic algorithm and gantt chart for job shop scheduling in distributed manufacturing systems (2007) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 53 (2), pp. 313-320; Yadollahi, M., Rahmani, A.M., Solving distributed flexible manufacturing systems scheduling problems subject to maintenance: Memetic algorithms approach (2009) Computer and Information Technology, 2009.

Globalization has further encouraged FMS development into distributed, self-reliant units of production center. Flexible manufacturing system in distributed system (FMSDS) considers multi-factory environments, where jobs are processed by a system of FMSs. Scheduling problems in FMSDS deal with allocation of jobs to factories, independent assignment of job operation to machines, and operations sequencing on a machine. In addition, many previous studies neglect the impact of maintenance as one of the core parts of production scheduling. Maintenance significantly affects the overall performance of production scheduling. As such, maintenance is considered in this paper as part of production scheduling. This paper aims to minimize the global makespan over all the factories. This paper proposes an improved immune algorithm (IIA) to solve scheduling problems in FMSDS subjects to machine maintenance. Antibody encoding is adopted to explicitly represents information about a factory, job, and maintenance, while a greedy decoding procedure exploits scheduling flexibility and determines the job routings. Instead of the traditional mutation operator, an improvised mutation operator is used to improve the solutions by refining the most promising individuals within passing generation (iteration). The proposed approach was compared with an ant colony algorithm and several variants of genetic algorithms. The proposed IIA improved the global makespan from 4% to 33% compared with other algorithms. IIA performance has also been tested with several adjustments of population sizes, clonal selection rates, and local explorative mutation rates.",Artificial immune system; Distributed manufacturing; Flexible manufacturing system; Optimization; Preventive maintenance,,,,,,,,,"Bagheri, A., Zandieh, M., Mahdavi, I., Yazdani, M., An artificial immune algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (2010) Future Generation Computer Systems, 26 (4), pp. 533-541; Chan, F.T.S., Chan, H., Lau, H., The state of the art in simulation study on fms scheduling: A comprehensive survey (2002) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 19 (11), pp. 830-849; Chan, F., Chung, S., Chan, P., An adaptive genetic algorithm with dominated genes for distributed scheduling problems (2005) Expert Systems With Applications, 29 (2), pp. 364-371; Chan, F., Chung, S., Chan, L., Finke, G., Tiwari, M., Solving distributed fms scheduling problems subject to maintenance: Genetic algorithms approach (2006) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 22 (5), pp. 493-504; Shen, W., Distributed manufacturing scheduling using intelligent agents (2002) Intelligent Systems, IEEE, 17 (1), pp. 88-94; Jia, H., Fuh, J., Nee, A., Zhang, Y., Integration of genetic algorithm and gantt chart for job shop scheduling in distributed manufacturing systems (2007) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 53 (2), pp. 313-320; Aboutalebi, M., Shirgahi, H., Motameni, H., Distributed flexible manufacturing system (fms) scheduling using memetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and timed petri net (2011) International Journal of the Physical Sciences, 6 (14), pp. 3557-3563; Jia, H., Nee, A., Fuh, J., Zhang, Y., A modified genetic algorithm for distributed scheduling problems (2003) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 14 (3), pp. 351-362; de Giovanni, L., Pezzella, F., An improved genetic algorithm for the distributed and flexible job-shop scheduling problem (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (2), pp. 395-408; Gholami, M., Zandieh, M., Integrating simulation and genetic algorithm to schedule a dynamic flexible job shop (2009) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 20 (4), pp. 481-498; Lee, D., Dicesare, F., Scheduling flexible manufacturing systems using petri nets and heuristic search (1994) Robotics and Automation, IEEE Transactions On, 10 (2), pp. 123-132; Paulli, J., A hierarchical approach for the fms scheduling problem (1995) European Journal of Operational Research, 86 (1), pp. 32-42; Reyes, A., Yu, H., Kelleher, G., Lloyd, S., Integrating petri nets and hybrid heuristic search for the scheduling of fms (2002) Computers In Industry, 47 (1), pp. 123-138; Kumar, R., Tiwari, M., Shankar, R., Scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems: An ant colony optimization approach (2003) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, 217 (10), pp. 1443-1453; Jerald, J., Asokan, P., Prabaharan, G., Saravanan, R., Scheduling optimisation of flexible manufacturing systems using particle swarm optimisation algorithm (2005) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 25 (9), pp. 964-971; Wadhwa, S., Prakash, A., Deshmukh, S., A knowledge based ga approach for fms scheduling (2009) Proceedings of the International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, 2. , Citeseer; Burnwal, S., Deb, S., Scheduling optimization of flexible manufacturing system using cuckoo search-based approach (2012) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, pp. 1-9; Chan, F., Chung, S., Chan, L., A study of distributed scheduling problem with machine maintenance (2006) Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems, 2006 IEEE Conference On.

Furthermore, they also wish to know certain recipes that suit to their preference. There are many cooking recipe websites but most of them do not provide suggestions for the user based on user's food preferences. Current recipe suggestions developed by some researchers are mainly based on the collective interests, demographic information, and ingredients content. With respect to the problem mentioned previously, a content based mobile recipe application is proposed and tested in this paper. The main objective of this proposed application is to suggest a user preferred recipe using content-based filtering algorithm. Content-based filtering algorithm (CBFA) will be applied to identify the recipes that have high possibility for user to like. This algorithm will be able to recommend recipes based on user interaction. The algorithm will consider a few attributes to identify the similarity between the recipe pages viewed by the user. The reason to choose this algorithm is because it does not have the cold-start problem and it solely depends on the active user to identify their preferences. An Android based mobile recipe application is built to test this algorithm. The results from the experiment conducted show that the proposed algorithm is effective for recommending preferred recipes to user. © 2014 IEEE.",Content-based Filtering Algorithm; Mobile Application,Algorithms; Ignition; Signal filtering and prediction; Software engineering; Starting; Thermal processing (foods); Cold start problems; Content based filtering; Content-based; Cooking recipe; Demographic information; Food preference; Mobile applications; User interaction; Cooking,,,,,,,,"Van Pinxteren, Y., Geleijnse, G., Kamsteeg, P., (2010) A User-centered Approach to Define A Content-based Recipe Similarity Measure; Li, Q., Kim, B.M., Constructing user profiles for collaborative recommender system (2004) Advanced Web Technologies and Applications, pp. 100-110. , Springer; Schafer, J.B., Frankowski, D., Herlocker, J., Sen, S., Collaborative filtering recommender systems (2007) The Adaptive Web, pp. 291-324. , Springer; Pazzani, M.J., Billsus, D., Content-based recommendation systems (2007) The Adaptive Web, pp. 325-341. , Springer; Lops, P., De Gemmis, M., Semeraro, G., Content-based recommender systems: State of the art and trends (2011) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 73-105. , Springer; Rajaraman, A., Ullman, J.D., (2011) Mining of Massive Datasets, , Cambridge University Press; Ramadoss, C., Recipe Recommendation.""; De Pessemier, T., Dooms, S., Martens, L., A food recommender for patients in a care facility (2013) Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems.

The situation demands a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. Various studies are done to balance the productivity and flexibility in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). From the literature, researchers have developed many approaches to reach a suitable balance of exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). We adopt a hybrid of population approaches; hybrid constraint-chromosome genetic algorithm and harmony search algorithm (H-CCGaHs), to solve this problem that aims at mapping a feasible solution to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as to increase the throughput while satisfying the constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The proposed algorithm is tested for its performance on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution approaches. © 2014, IJICIC Editorial Office.

Various introductory approaches were proposed to address the distributed production scheduling dilemma of FMS, where a significant part of the problem lies with preventive maintenance machine downtime. This affects overall production schedules, rendering previously proposed approaches ineffective. This paper introduces the Artificial Immune System (AIS) approach to tackle this underlying problem. Using the antigenic clustering features inherent in AIS, the problem will be replicated and tested with several parameter tweaks to demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating the issue. © 2013 ICIC International.",Artificial immune system; Distributed manufacturing; Flexible manufacturing system; Preventive maintenance,Artificial Immune System; Clustering feature; Distributed manufacturing; Distributed productions; Distributed scheduling problem; Machine downtime; Production schedule; Immune system; Preventive maintenance; Production control; Production engineering; Flexible manufacturing systems,,,,,,,,"Floyd, T.L., (2008) Electronic Devices: Electron Flow Version, , 8th Edition, Pearson Prentice Hall; Kaewpoonsuk, A., Petchmaneelumka, W., Rerkratn, A., Tammaruckwattana, A., Riewruja, V., A novel resolver-to-DC converter based on OTA-based inverse-sine function circuit (2008) SICE Annual Conference, pp. 609-614; Chen, D., Yang, W., Pan, M., Design of impedance measuring circuits based on phase-sensitive demodulation technique (2011) IEEE Trans.

Globalization of the industrial system has encouraged the development of distributed manufacturing, including flexible manufacturing system. As such, the complexity of the problem faced in this new environment promotes current researcher to develop various approaches in optimizing the production scheduling. Approaches such as petri net, ant colony, genetic algorithm, intelligent agents, particle swarm optimization, and tabu search are used to apprehend optimization issues. In reality, maintenance is one of the core parts which is important to the manufacturing scheduling as it will affect greatly toward the manufacturing scheduling when the machine breakdown happen.

This scenario has given rise to the demand for improved capacity planning efficiency while maintaining their flexibilities. One important aspect of capacity planning is machine loading, which is known for its complexity encompassing various types of flexibility aspects that pertain to part selection and operation assignment along with constraint. The main objective of flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is to balance the productivity and flexibility of the production shop floor. From the literature, researchers have proposed many methods and approaches to attain a balance in exploring (global improvement) and exploiting (local improvement). We propose a constraint-chromosome genetic algorithm to solve this problem, which aims at mapping the right chromosome representation to the domain problem as well as helps avoid getting trapped in local minima. The objective functions are to minimize the system unbalance and increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 10 sample problems available in the FMS literature and compared with existing solution methods Based on the results, the overall combined objective function increased by 3.60% from the previous best result. © 2012 ISSN 1349-4198.",Flexible manufacturing system; Genetic algorithm; Machine loading; System unbalance; Through-put,Capacity planning; Domain problems; Local minimums; Machine loading; Manufacturing industries; Market environment; Objective functions; Part selection; Product variety; Production shops; Short product; Solution methods; System unbalance; Technological constraints; Chromosomes; Competition; Flexible manufacturing systems; Genetic algorithms; Loading; Problem solving,,,,,,,,"Viswanadham, N., Narahari, Y., (1992) Performance Modeling of Automated Manufacturing Systems, , Prentice-Hall, Inc., India; Stecke, K.E., Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems (1983) Management Science, 29 (3), pp. 273-288; Berrada, M., Stecke, K.E., A branch and bound approach for machine load balancing in flexible manufacturing systems (1986) Management Science, 32 (10), pp. 1316-1335; Hwang, S., (1986) Models For Production Planning In Flexible Manufacturing System, , Thesis, University of California; Liang, M., Dutta, S.P., An integrated approach to the part selection and machine loading problem in a class of flexible manufacturing systems (1993) European Journal of Operational Research, 67 (3), pp. 387-404; Kumar, A., Prakash, M., Tiwari, K., Shankar, R., Baveja, A., Solving machine-loading problem of a flexible manufacturing system with constraint-based genetic algorithm (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (2), pp. 1043-1069; Srinivas, M., Tiwari, K., Allada, V., Solving the machine-loading problem in a flexible manufac-turing system using a combinatorial auction-based approach (2004) International Journal of Production Research, 42 (9), pp. 1879-1893; Ammons, J.C., Lofgren, C.B., McGinnis, L.F., A large scale machine loading problem in flexible assembly (1985) Annals of Operations Research, 3 (7), pp. 317-332; Shanker, K., Tzen, Y.-J.J., A loading and dispatching problem in a random flexible manufacturing system (1985) International Journal of Production Research, 23 (3), pp. 579-595; Mukhopadhyay, S.K., Midha, S., Krishna, V.M., A heuristic procedure for loading problems in flexible manufacturing systems (1992) International Journal of Production Research, 30 (9), pp. 2213-2228; Tiwari, M.K., Hazarika, B., Vidyarthi, N.K., Jaggi, P., Mukhopadhyay, S.K., A heuristic solution approach to the machine loading problem of an FMS and its petri net model (1997) International Journal of Production Research, 35 (8), pp. 2269-2284; Sarin, S., Chen, C., The machine loading and tool allocation problem in a flexible manufacturing system (1987) International Journal of Production Research, 25 (7), pp. 1081-1094; Nayak, G.K., Acharya, D., Part type selection, machine loading and part type volume deter-mination problems in FMS planning (1998) International Journal of Production Research, 36 (7), pp. 1801-1824; Mukhopadhyay, S.K., Singh, M.K., Srivastava, R., FMS machine loading: A simulated annealing approach (1998) International Journal of Production Research, 36 (6), pp. 1529-1547; Shanker, K., Srinivasulu, A., Some solution methodologies for loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system (1989) International Journal of Production Research, 27 (6), pp. 1019-1034; Sarma, U.M.B.S., Kant, S., Rai, R., Tiwari, M.K., Modelling the machine loading problem of FMSs and its solution using a tabu-search-based heuristic (2002) International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 15 (4), pp. 285-295; Swarnkar, R., Tiwari, M.K., Modeling machine loading problem of FMSs and its solution methodology using a hybrid tabu search and simulated annealing-based heuristic approach (2004) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 20 (3), pp. 199-209; Nagarjuna, N., Mahesh, O., Rajagopal, K., A heuristic based on multi-stage programming approach for machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system (2006) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 22 (4), pp. 342-352; Li, Y., Ip, W.H., Wang, D.W., Genetic algorithm approach to earliness and tardiness production scheduling and planning problem (1998) International Journal of Production Economics, 54, pp. 65-76; Tiwari, M.K., Vidyarthi, N.K., Solving machine loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system using a genetic algorithm based heuristic approach (2000) International Journal of Production Research, 38 (14), pp. 3357-3384; Ip, W.H., Li, Y., Man, K.F., Tang, K.S., Multi-product planning and scheduling using genetic algorithm approach (2000) Comput.

The situation poses a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. The main objective of the flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is to balance the productivity of the production floor as well as maintaining its flexibility. From the literature, optimization-based methods tend to become impractical when the problem size increases while heuristic-based methods are more robust in their practicality although they may dependent on constraints of individual problems. We adopt a Harmony Search algorithm (HS) to solve this problem that aims on mapping the feasible solution vectors to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution methods. © 2011 IEEE.",Flexible manufacturing system; Harmony Search algorithm; Machine loading; System unbalance; Throughput,Capacity planning; Domain problems; Feasible solution; Harmony search algorithms; Machine loading; Machine loading problems; Machine time; Manufacturing industries; Part selection; Problem size; Product life cycles; Product variety; Production floor; Resource optimization; Solution methods; System unbalance; Technological constraints; Competition; Data mining; Heuristic methods; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Loading; Machine components; Optimization; Problem solving; Search engines; Flexible manufacturing systems,,,,,,,,"Viswanadham, N., Narahari, Y., (1992) Performance Modeling of Automated Manufacturing Systems, , Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc; Stecke, K.E., Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems (1983) Management Science, 29 (3), pp. 273-288; Kumar, A., Tiwari, P.M., Shankar, R., Baveja, A., Solving machine-loading problem of a flexible manufacturing system with constraint-based genetic algorithm (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (2), pp. 1043-1069; Tiwari, S.K.M., Allada, V., Solving the machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system using a combinatorial auction-based approach (2004) International Journal of Production Research, 42 (9), pp. 1879-1893; Swarnkar, R., Tiwari, M.K., Modeling machine loading problem of fmss and its solution methodology using a hybrid tabu search and sim- ulated annealing-based heuristic approach (2004) Robotics and Computer- Integrated Manufacturing, 20 (3), pp. 199-209; Geem, Z.W., Kim, J.H., Loganathan, G., A new heuristic opti- mization algorithm: Harmony search (2001) Simulation, 76 (2), pp. 60-68; Geem, Z.W., (2005) School Bus Routing Using Harmony Search, 76 (2), pp. 60-68; Geem, Z., (2006) Improved Harmony Search from Ensemble of Music Players, 4251. , ser.

Such portals become an indispensable platform for members especially for a Special Interest Groups (SIG) to share knowledge and expertise in their respective fields. Finding expertise over the e-community portal will help interested people and researchers to identify other experts, working in the same area. However, it is quite a cumbersome task to search such expertise in the portal. In order to find an expert, expertise data mining could be a solution to ease the search of experts. Performing effective data mining technique will help to analyze and measure expertise level accurately in a SIG portal. This paper proposes a method called Expertise Data Mining (EDM) that comprises a few techniques for expertise search in a SIG portal. It expects to improve the finding of experts among the members of a SIG e-community. © 2011 IEEE.",Data mining; expertise search; information retrieval; knowledge discovery; Web mining,Data mining techniques; E-community; expertise search; Knowledge portals; Share knowledge; Special interest groups; Web Mining; Antennas; Information retrieval; Optimization; User interfaces; Data mining,,,,,,,,"Bollacker, K.D., Lawrence, S., Giles, C.L., Discovering relevant scientific literature on the Web (2000) Intelligent Systems and Their Applications, IEEE, 15, pp. 42-47; Hu, W., Yuan, J., Yuantao, S., The research of a Web mining method in research areas (2005) The Sixth Wuhan Interenational Conference on E-Business, pp. 314-319; He, Y., Hui, S.C., Fong, A.C.M., Mining a Web citation database for document clustering (2002) Applied Artificial Intelligence: An International Journal, 16, pp. 283-302; Christos, F., Douglas, W.O., (1995) A Survey of Information Retrieval and Filtering Methods, , University of Maryland at College Park; (2011), http://www.yahoo.com, [Online]; (2011), http://www.lycos.com, [Online]; (2011), http://www.google.com, [Online]; (2011), http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/, [Online]; (2011), http://dblp.uni-trier.de/, [Online]; (2011), http://www.daniweb.com/, [Online]; (2011), http://forums.sun.com/index.jspa, [Online]; Tho, Q.T., Hui, S.C., Fong, A.C.M., A Web mining approach for finding expertise in research areas (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Cyberworlds, , IEEE CS; Tho, Q.T., Hui, S.C., Fong, A.C.M., A citation-based document retrieval system for finding research expertise (2007) Information Processing & Management, 43, pp. 248-264; Ismail, A., Sulaiman, S., Sabudin, M., Sulaiman, S., A point-based semi-automatic expertise classification (PBaSE) method for knowledge management of an online Special Interest Group (2008) Proceedings of International Symposium on Information Technology, 2, pp. 794-800. , ITSIM'08, IEEE; Tianbiao, Y., Jing, Z., Kai, Z., Wei, W., Wanshan, W., Study on project expertś evaluation based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation, 1. , IEEE CS; Yong-Hong, S., Jian, M., Zhi-Ping, F., Jun, W., A group decision support approach to evaluate experts for R&D project selection (2008) Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on, 55, pp. 158-170; Qijia, T., Jian, M., Jiazhi, L., Ron, C.W.K., Ou, L., An organizational decision support system for effective R&D project selection (2005) Decis.

In facts, requirement engineering is important to get all the requirements needed for an expert system. If the requirements do not meet the clients' needs, the expert system is considered fail although it works perfectly. Currently, there are a lot of studies proposing and describing the development of expert systems. However, they are focusing in a specific and narrow domain of problems. Also, the major concern of most researchers is the design issues of the expert system. Therefore, we emphasize on the very first step of success expert system development requirement engineering. Hence, we are focusing in the requirement engineering techniques in order to present the most practical way to facilitate requirement engineering processes. In this paper, we analyze expert system attributes, requirement engineering processes in expert system developments and the possible techniques that can be applied to expert system developments. Next, we propose the most appropriate techniques for the expert system developments based on the analysis.

Nevertheless such websites are sometimes not updated, do not provide required information or the worst case they are abandoned despite the fact that software developers have fulfilled the requirements of the users, and the systems have been deployed successfully. Hence, such websites require a dynamic web design that can delegate responsibility to each staff in ensuring the contents are always updated either to be shared among the staff or the public. This paper proposes an approach called EPISoDe that directly integrates organisations' policies as part of functional requirements in software development in this case we focus on website design and its implementation of higher learning institutions. We have deployed the proposed EPISoDe approach in a prototype called DyWeMS that provides an engine of a dynamic web design. We evaluated the approach on an official website of a school in a higher learning institution using DyWeMS dynamic engine. It implies that an organisational official website has the potential to be a one-stop information and knowledge centre that reflects organisations' history and legacy using the proposed EPISoDe approach that promotes delegation of responsibilities among the staff with the support of dynamic web design. © 2011 IEEE.",Dynamic Web Design; Official Websites; Organisations' Policy; Software Development,Functional requirement; Higher learning; Integrated approach; Official Websites; One stop; Organisations' Policy; Software developer; Web designs; Web site design; Worst case; Computer science; Computer software; Design; Gateways (computer networks); Information science; Societies and institutions; User interfaces; Websites; Software design,,,,,,,,"www.microsoft.com, accessed on November 2010; www.usm.my, accessed on November 2010; Sulaiman, S., Yusof, U.K., Sulaiman, S., A method to integrate Organisations' policies into web design (2008) The Fourth Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC'08), pp. 307-312. , Malaysia, 16-17 December; He, Q., Otto, P., Anton, A.I., Jones, L., Ensuring compliance between policies, requirements and software design: A case study (2006) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Information Assurance (IWIA'06); www.cs.usm.my, School of Computer Sciences, accessed on June 2009; www.cs.usm.my/v3, School of Computer Sciences, accessed on November 2010; Ong, C.-S., Lai, J.-Y., Wang, Y.-M., Wang, S.-W., An understanding of power issues influencing employees' acceptance of KMS: An empirical study of Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companies (2005) Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference (HICSS'05), pp. 1-10. , January; Hall, H., Input-friendliness: Motivating knowledge sharing across intranets (2001) Journal of Information Science, 27 (3), pp. 139-146; Hall, H., Goody, M., KM, culture and compromise: Interventions to promote knowledge sharing supported by technology in corporate environments (2007) Journal of Information Science, 33 (2), pp. 181-188. , DOI 10.1177/0165551506070708; Gillies, J.S., Cultural obstacles to a successful KM initiative in large law firms (2005) KMWorld & Intranets 2005 Conferences & Exposition, , San Jose, November; Moore, J.W., The Road Map to Software Engineering: A Standardsbased Guide, , John Wiley & Sons.USA; Webometrics, , www.webometrics.info, accessed on November 2010; Mambo CMS Latest Release, , http://mambofoundation.org/, accessed on November 2010; Joomla CMS, , http://www.joomla.org/, accessed on November 2010; www.ieee.org, accessed on November 2010; http://www.info.sciverse.com/scopus, accessed on November 2010","Sulaiman, S.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia; email: shahida@cs.usm.my",,IEEE Advancing Technology for Humanity;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Malaysia Computer Chapter;IEEE Malaysia;IEEE Malaysia Power Electron.

ERP is more than a software package; it includes the efforts and activities to integrate internal and external management information, business process automation and reengineering, and organisation structure streamlining. Thus, ERP eventually leads to an efficient and competitive business. Despite the prominence of ERP systems, approximately three-quarters of ERP projects are deemed as failures. Most failures are attributed to the misfit between pre-loaded business models in the ERP system and business requirements in the real world. This paper introduces a framework to classify ERP misfits into logical categories that provide insights for solution derivation. Subsequently, the classification methods are applied to a case study. Practitioners can use the misfit classification method to derive corresponding actions as solutions for ERP misfits based on their nature or specificity. In addition, the theoretical contribution of the ERP misfit problem is explored to provide information for researchers to determine appropriate theories and concepts explaining this domain. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.",Business information system; Business strategies and processes; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); ERP implementation problems; Misalignment; Misfits,,,,,,,,,"Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120. , doi: 10.1177/014920639101700108; Brehm, L., Heinzl, A., Markus, M.L., Tailoring ERP systems: A spectrum of choices and their implications (2001) Paper Presented at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, , Maui, Hawaii; Bryman, A., (1988) Quantity and Quality in Social Research By Alan Bryman, , London: Unwin Hyman; Calisir, F., Calisir, F., The relation of interface usability characteristics, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use to end-user satisfaction with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (2004) Computers in Human Behavior, 20 (4), pp. 505-515; Chen, H.-H., Road, Z.N., Chen, S.-C., A study of successful ERP - from the organization fit perspective (2009) Journal of Systemics, Cybernatics, and Informatics, 7 (4), pp. 8-16; Das, A., Narasimhan, R., Process-technology fit and its implications for manufacturing performance (2001) Journal of Operations Management, 19, pp. 521-540; Davenport, T.H., Putting the enterprise into the enterprise system (1998) Harvard Business Review, 76, pp. 121-131; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Understanding the plant level costs and benefits of ERP: Will the ugly duckling always turn into a swan (2000) Paper Presented at the Proceedings of 33rd International Conference on System Sciences, , Hawaii; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Software-driven changes to business processes: An empirical study of impacts of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at the local level (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40, pp. 4799-4814; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Understanding the local-level costs and benefits of ERP through organizational information processing theory (2004) Journal of Information & Management, 41, pp. 431-443; Gribbins, M.L., Subramaniam, C., Shaw, M.J., Process-technology fit: Extending task-technology fit to assess enterprise information technologies (2006) Paper Presented at the 27th International Conference on Information Systems, , Milwaukee; Gupta, M., Kohli, A., Enterprise resource planning systems and its implications for operations function (2006) Technovation, 26 (5-6), pp. 687-696; Guttridge, A.D.P., Dani, S., Burns, N., Investigating factors affecting ERP selection in made-to-order SME sector (2008) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 19 (4), pp. 430-446. , doi: 10.1108/17410380810869905; Holsapple, C.W., Wang, Y.M., Wu, J.H., Empirically testing user characteristics and fitness factors in enterprise resource planning success (2006) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 19, pp. 323-342; Hong, K., Kim, Y., The critical success factors for ERP implementation: An organizational fit perspective (2002) Journal of Information & Management, 40, pp. 25-40; Koh, S.C.L., Saad, S.M., Managing uncertainty in ERP-controlled manufacturing environments in SMEs (2006) International Journal of Production Economics, 101 (1), pp. 109-127; Leary, D.E.O., Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems: An empirical analysis of benefits (2005) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, 2, pp. 63-72; Madapusi, A., Derrick, D.S., Aligning ERP systems with international strategies (2003) Information Systems Management, 22 (1), pp. 7-17; Mignerat, M., Rivard, S., Positioning the institutional perspective in information systems research (2009) Journal of Information Technology, 24 (4), pp. 369-391; Moon, Y.B., Enterprise resource planning (ERP): A review of the literature (2007) International Journal of Management and Enterprise Development, 4 (3), pp. 235-264; Morton, N.A., Hu, Q., Implications of the fit between organizational structure and ERP: A structural contingency theory perspective (2008) International Journal of Information Management, 28, pp. 391-402; Olsen, K.A., Sætre, P., IT for niche companies: Is an ERP system the solution?

There is no doubt that more and more Malaysians are using short message service (SMS) instead of making voice calls. In order to satisfy the needs and demands of users, mobile phone manufacturers are constantly adapting and innovating to ensure that they can survive in this competitive market. An important innovation in SMS technology lately is the speech recognition technology that can convert voice messages into text messages. In other words, messages can be voice/speech typed. Currently, voice messages can only be converted into text messages in the form of normal/standard text using fully spelled words. This paper attempts to evaluate the level of acceptance of a software application which uses either standard or abbreviation text messaging dictionary for voice messaging. The product is known as iSay-SMS, a hands-free voice messaging application that enables users to send messages without the need of using keypad to type messages in the form of original fully spelled word or abbreviations or shortened form of a word. Among various technology acceptance models studied, MOPTAM was chosen as the basis of the survey. The result of the survey concluded that iSay-SMS would be accepted by the majority of mobile phone users because of its ease of use. © 2010 IEEE.",Hands-free voice messaging; iSay-SMS; MOPTAM; Short Message Service (SMS); TAM; UTAUT,iSay-SMS; MOPTAM; Short message services; TAM; UTAUT; Voice messaging; Cellular telephone systems; Character recognition; Innovation; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Speech recognition; Surveys; Technology; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone; Telephone sets; Message passing,,,,,,,,"Kelsey, R., (2010) Importance of Mobile Phones for Teenagers!, , http://ezinearticles.com/?Importance-of-Mobile-Phones-For- Teenagers!&id=4410785, Online.

Short message service (SMS) which is an important component in mobile phones is growing popular among mobile phone subscribers. The use of SMS nowadays is more than the calling function itself. In order to make the SMS function in mobile phones more efficient and attractive, speech recognition which allows users to use it for voice messages and enables users to speak in a natural way to communicate with others through their mobile phones is introduced. However, speech recognition technology to SMS is in the form of standard language is contradicted with the popularity of SMS that is used in the form of text abbreviation or short form. The research was conducted to find a solution for speech recognition technologies to enable it to transfer human speech into personalized text abbreviations. Studies and findings had been conducted regarding the possible technologies to solve problems such as voice-tag, architecture of ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system and Part-of-speech (POS). The problem with the inability to transfer speech to text abbreviation will be solved by adding a personalized data dictionary that enables users to save their own personalized words by integrating the voice-tag and part-of-speech tagging (POS) technology into iSay-SMS to help in saving and retrieving the text abbreviations. In addition, proposed framework of iSay-SMS is designed in such a way that promotes its marketability and increases the acceptance among the mobile phone subscribers. © 2010 IEEE.",Mobile devices; Short Messaging Services;

It is difficult to decide which aspect needs to be given more attention when it comes to designing a Website as aesthetics is focusing on the 'look' and 'feel' while usability is stressing on its functionalities. There is no perfect answer which aspects of the Web design are more important than the others. In addition, it is also difficult to have a balance of these two seemingly contrary objectives of Web design. This research focuses on how to balance the aesthetics design and the usability of Web design. This study also investigates methods to evaluate Web page's usability and aesthetic appeal, the role of these two aspects play in the Website design and also the relationship between these two aspects. The results of study provide a tangible concept on how the Web usability and the Web aesthetics design affect each other and methods to balance between the Web usability and aesthetics design. The contribution of this paper is to provide guiding principle to the Website developer in order to develop a Website which is well-balance in usability as well as its aesthetics aspect. © 2010 IEEE.",Aesthetics; Usability; Web design; Web page,Aesthetics; Guiding principles; Usability; Web designs; Web page; Web site design; Web usability; Design; Information technology; Usability engineering; Websites,,,,,,,,"Tractinsky, N., Katz, A.S., Ikar, D., What is beautiful is usable (2000) Interacting with Computers, 13 (2), pp. 127-145. , December; (1997) ISO 9241: Ergonomic Requirements for Office Systems with Visual Display Terminals (VDTs), , ISO.

There are two main approaches being studied to solve the problem: linear programming-based and bio-inspired approaches. Recently, more studies are focusing on bio-inspired approaches, where amongst them, genetic algorithm (GA) is being the most popular one. We propose a constraint-chromosome (CCGA) to solve this problem by applying the workable chromosome representation to the domain problem. The approach developed helps to avoid from getting trapped at local minima and is able to search for more solutions. This method is chosen to allow the running of GA in its original form as well as to ensure the computation is straightforward and simple. The objective of the algorithm is to optimize the utilization of the machines that leads to an increase in the company's overall profit. It has been found that the proposed CCGA is able to propose good solution to the problem. © 2010 IEEE.",Capacity planning; Genetic Algorithm; Machine allocation; Optimization approach; Semiconductor manufacturing,Bio-inspired approach; Capacity planning; Domain problems; Local minimums; Machine allocation; Machine loading problems; Machine utilization; Optimization approach; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor manufacturing; Chromosomes; Genetic algorithms; Information technology; Linear programming; Manufacture; Optimization; Profitability; Problem solving,,,,,,,,"Huang, D., Van, J., Qiao, F., Modeling with hierarchical Petri net of semiconductor manufacturing system (2004) Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Conference, ICARCV 2004 8th, 3, pp. 2217-2222; Chou, Y.C., Cheng, C.T., Yang, F.C., Liang, Y.Y., Evaluating alternative capacity strategies in semiconductor manufacturing under uncertain demand and price scenarios (2007) International Journal of Production Economics, 105, pp. 591-606; Liang, Y.Y., Chou, Y.C., Option-based capacity planning for semiconductor manufacturing (2003) IEEE International Symposium on Semiconductor Manufacturing, pp. 77-80; Rajagopalan, S., Capacity expansion with alternative technology choices (1994) European Journal of Operational Research, 77; Hung, Y.-F., Wang, Q.-Z., A new formulation technique for alternative material planning; an approach for semiconductor bin allocation planning (1997) Comput.

However they probably encounter hajj related problems that require them to make immediate decisions especially while performing hajj. In such situations they may refer to hajj guide books or their fellow pilgrims. Besides, they may need to refer to hajj experts in the decision making process pertaining to more complex problems. Nevertheless, experts may not be around all the time especially while performing hajj rituals. We propose a knowledge-based approach that can capture possible problems and solutions from the experts in a prototype known as hajj Q&A expert system or Hajj-QAES. It provides an interface that enables experts to capture both simple and advanced questions. Thus, we anticipate Hajj-QAES can support pilgrims both in learning process and most importantly while performing hajj in Mecca. Such systems would be more accessible should it be installed in handheld devices such as a hand phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA). © 2009 IEEE.",Decision making; Expert system; Hajj complex problems; Knowledge base,Complex problems; Decision making process; Hand held device; Knowledge base; Knowledge-based approach; Knowledge-based expert systems; Learning process; Digital devices; Expert systems; Personal digital assistants; Telephone systems; Decision making,,,,,,,,"Hsu, Y.-Y., Su, C.-C., A rule-based expert system for steady-state stability analysis [of Power Systems] (1991) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 6 (2), pp. 771-777. , May; Santos, C.P., Querying petrographic descriptions in an intelligent database system (2002) IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Systems (ICAIS 2002), pp. 18-23; Kienreich, W., Sabol, V., Granitzer, M., Klieber, W., Lux, M., Sarka, W., A Visual query interface for a very large newspaper article repository (2005) Proceedings of Sixteenth International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 415-419; Lovic, S., Meiliu, L., Du, Z., Enhancing search engine performance using expert systems (2006) IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, pp. 567-572; Shao, W.Z., Soon, H.S., Intelligent query mechanism for expert systems (1990) Proceedings of Fourteenth Annual International Computer Software and Expert System Applications Conference COMPSAC90, pp. 599-604; Lopatenko, A., Bertossi, L., Consistent query answering by minimal-size repairs (2006) 17th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications DEXA'06, pp. 558-562; Giarratano, J., Riley, G., (1998) Expert Systems Principles and Programming, , 3rd Edition, PWS Publishing Co.

Affinity portals promote electronic communities who share common interest such as a special interest group (SIG). Knowledge portal is an emerging trend that benefits the existing portal technology by designing such portals with proper representation of the members' shared knowledge. Besides textual representation for diverse expertise levels, graphical visualisation will be able to support the requirements in searching and representing expertise level among e-community. There is a number of existing SIG portals available. However, they do not visualise effectively and accurately the expertise level of members and make it difficult for users to search their targeted experts for instance searching the highest expertise level to have a discussion and to solve their problems related to a project.

However, as capacity planning is highly affected by the demand forecast uncertainty, there is a necessity to make the gap closer to ensure profitability. The paper defines the problems faced by a semiconductor company in handling capacity planning and balancing the capital investment cost against the risk of losing revenue. Machine allocation in capacity planning is a process to determine mixture of a machine types that satisfy all precedence and resource constraints and minimize the total machines allocation. We adopt constraint-based genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this optimization problem with the focus on mapping the right chromosome representation to the domain problem. The method is chosen to allow the running of GA in original form as well as to ensure the computation is straight forward and simple. © 2009 IEEE.",,Capacity planning; Capital investment; Constraint-based; Demand forecast; Domain problems; Handling capacity; Machine allocation; Machine requirements; Optimization problems; Resource Constraint; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor companies; Semiconductor manufacturing; Constrained optimization; Economics; Genetic algorithms; Profitability; Investments,,,,,,,,"Huang, D., Yan, J., Qiao, F., Modeling with Hierarchical Petri Net of Semiconductor Manufacturing System (2004) Proc. 8th IEEE Int.
