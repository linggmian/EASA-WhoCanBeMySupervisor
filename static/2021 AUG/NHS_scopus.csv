This paper also address language identification framework however with data has been downsized considerably from general language identification architecture. The system goal is to identify the type of language being spoken to the system based on a series of trained speech with sound file features and without any language text data or lexical knowledge of the spoken language. The system is also expected to be able to be deployed in mobile platform in future. This paper is specifically about measuring the performance optimisation of audio filters on a CNN model integration for the language identification system. There are several metric to gauge the performance identification system for a classification problem. Precision, recall and F1 Scores is presented for the performance evaluation with different combination of filters together with CNN model as the framework of the language identification system. The goal is not to get the best filter for noise, instead to identify the filter that is a good fit to develop language model with environmental noise for a robust language identification system. Our experiments manage to identify the best combination of filters to increase the accuracy of language identification using short speech. This resulting us to modify our pre-processing phase in the overall language identification system. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.

Techniques of fake news stories detection ingenious, varied, and exciting. This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analytics and train deep learning models for detecting fake news based on news title or news content. Solution proposed in this study aims to be applied in real-world social media and eliminate the bad experience for user to receive misleading stories that come from non-reputable source. For NLP techniques, text preprocessing such as regular expression, tokenization, lemmatization and stop words removal are used before vectorizing them into N-gram vectors or sequence vectors using terms frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or one-hot encoding respectively. Then, TensorFlow is chosen as the framework to be used with built in Keras deep learning libraries that is having a large community and number of commits on Tensorflow GitHub repository that can be enough to build deep learning neural network models. Results from the models are showing that models trained with news content can achieve better performance with computation time being sacrificed while models trained with news title require less computation time to achieve good performance. Also, overall performance of models fed with N-gram vectors are slightly better than models fed with sequence vectors. © 2020 IEEE.",deep learning; Fake news; Keras; natural language processing; neural network; TensorFlow,Computational linguistics; Industrial electronics; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); State assignment; Text processing; User experience; Vectors; Computation time; Inverse Document Frequency; Learning models; Learning neural networks; NAtural language processing; Nlp techniques; Regular expressions; Text preprocessing; Deep learning,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9, PKOMP6711634","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 (PKOMP6711634) with title “Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification”.",,"Hassan, N.H., New Straits Times, , https://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnists/2019/02/462486/anti-fake-news-act-irrelevant, New Straits Times, 21 February 2019, [Accessed 24 November 2019]; Vasandani, J., (2019) Towards Data Science, , Medium, 9 April; https://towardsdatascience.com/i-built-afake-news-detector-using-natural-language-processing-andclassification-models-da180338860e, [Accessed 24 November 2019]; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/opinion/brazil-electionfake-news-whatsapp.html, M.

Heteronym is a homograph words which the meaning and the pronunciation differ according to the semantic of the sentence. There is only 12 unique heteronym in Malay. However, these words can be expanded depending on the morphology of the sentence. Malay language is also very rich with prefix and suffixes. Thus, one word can be expanded either to two unique words or more. For the list of 12 unique pair of words, we can expand the list to 98 unique words. Thus, there are greater variation possibility of enunciating a heteronym words. This research showed the importance of a study on heteronym words specifically in TTS case as well as what would be the best approach of handling heteronym ambiguity when only the sampled data is available but not tagged data of a particular target language. © 2019 IEEE.",expandable corpora; heteronym; homograph disambiguation; limited resource; text-to-speech,Engineering; Industrial engineering; Malay languages; Malay texts; Sampled data; Tagged data; Target language; Text analysis; Text-to-speech system; Unique word; Semantics,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315273, 304/PKOMP/6315273, 304/PKOMP/6315273, 304/PKOMP/6315273

Our approach involves three main steps: language clustering, grapheme to phoneme mapping and prosody modelling. We have tested the mapping of phonemes from German to English and from Indonesian to Spanish. We have also constructed three prosody representations for different language characteristics. For evaluation we have developed an English TTS based on German data, and a Spanish TTS based on Indonesian data and compared their performance against pre-existing monolingual TTSs. Since our motivation is to develop speech synthesis for resource poor languages, we have also developed three TTS for Iban, an Austronesian language with practically no available language resources, using Malay, Indonesian and Spanish resources.",Multilinguality; Polyglot speech synthesis; Resource adaptation; TTS,Mapping; Speech synthesis; Austronesian languages; Grapheme to phonemes; Language resources; Multilinguality; Polyglot speech synthesis; Resource adaptation; Text-to-speech synthesis system; Text-to-speech system; Modeling languages,,,,,"Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, UNIMAS",The authors acknowledge the contributions of the researchers from Sarawak Language Technology (SaLT) Research Group at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UniMAS).,,"Crystal, D., (2010) The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Language, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 3rd ed. edition; Don, Z., Knowles, G., Yong, J., Howwords can be misleading: A study of syllable timing and ""stress"" in Malay (2008) The Linguistics Journal, 3 (2); Hirst, D., Form and function in the representation of speech prosody (2005) Speech Communication, 46 (3-4), pp. 334-347; Hirst, D., A praat plugin for MOMEL and INTSINT with improved algorithms for modelling and coding intonation (2007) Proceedings of ICPhS 2007, pp. 1233-1236. , Saarbrücken, Germany, 6-10 August 2007, Universität des Saarlandes; Paul Lewis, M., (2011) Iban: A Language of Malaysia (Sarawak), , Internet.

The data is obtained from existing resources. The focus of the paper is the phonetic and linguistic aspects. A monolingual TTS architecture is introduced with descriptions on each stage of processing. A multilingual TTS architecture is also introduced. Language dependent and language independent information required in the general TTS engine is described. Finally we will propose layer of communication between the pooled language information and a TTS engine in order to make it available for information reuse where possible for different languages.,,Information reuse; Language informations; Linguistic information; Linguistic resources; Text-to-speech system; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Speech synthesis,,,,,,,,"Crystal, D., (2002) The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Language, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2 edn; Hirst, D.J., Automatic analysis of prosody for multilingual speech corpora (2001) Improvements in Speech Synthesis, , eds.

This is to show whether there is any difference in pronouncing these two types of spelling form in Malay. It is also important to know that Malay is a non-tonal language. Thus, this study will not be affected by semantic of a word. This comparison is important to determine whether it is necessary to have a parameter to represent different prominence in pronunciation between these two situations in our unit selection speech corpus. © 2005 IEEE.",Glides formation / insertion; Orthographic form; Phonological form; Speech synthesis; Unit selection,Glides formation / insertion; Non-tonal languages; Orthographic form; Phonological form; Speech corpora; Unit selection; Biomedical engineering; Signal processing; Speech synthesis,,,,,,,,"Huang, X., Acero, A., Won, H.-W., Spoken language processing: A guide to theory, algorithm and system development (2001) Pearson Publication: New Jersey; Campbell, W.N., Labelling an english speech database for prosody control (1992) Proceeding ASJ, Spring, 1-P-8; Campbell, W.N., CHATR: A high-definition speech re-sequencing system (1996) Proceedings 3rd ASA/ASJ Joint Meeting, pp. 1223-1228; Campbell, W.N., Processing a speech corpus for CHATR synthesis (1997) Proceedings of the International Conference on Speech Processing 1997, pp. 183-186; Beutnagel, M., Conkie, A., Schroeter, J., Styliano, Y., Syrdal, A., The AT&T Next-gen TTS system (1999) 137th Proceedings of the Joint Meeting of ASA, EAA, and DAGA, Berlin; Conkie, A., Robust unit selection system for speech synthesis (1999) Joint Meeting of ASA/EAA/DAGA, , Berlin; TTS Interactive Demo (AT&T Labs Research), , http://www.research.att.com/projects/tts/demo.html; CHATR (generic speech synthesis system) ATR Interpreting Telecommunication Research Labs, , http://feast.atr.jp/chatr/chatr/; Kassim, T.A., (2000) The Phonological Word in Standard Malay, , PhD Thesis, University of Newcastle; Dahaman, I., Pedoman ejaan dan sebutan bahasa melayu (1996) Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, , Kuala Lumpur","Samsudin, N.-H.; Computer-Aided Translation Unit (UTMK), , Penang, Malaysia; email: nursham@cs.usm.my",,,,"2005 1st International Conference on Computers, Communications and Signal Processing with Special Track on Biomedical Engineering, CCSP 2005",14 November 2005 through 16 November 2005,Kuala Lumpur,76725,,1424400112; 9781424400119,,,English,"Int.
