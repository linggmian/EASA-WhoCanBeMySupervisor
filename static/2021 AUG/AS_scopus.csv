Data manipulation is a serious threat to data integrity which can occur in cloud computing - a relatively new offering under the umbrella of cloud services. Data can be tampered with, and malicious actors could use this to their advantage. Cloud computing clients in various application domains want to be assured that their data is accurate and trustworthy. On another spectrum, blockchain is a tamper-proof digital ledger that can be used alongside cloud technology to provide a tamper-proof cloud computing environment. This paper proposes a scheme that combines cloud computing with blockchain that assures data integrity for all homomorphic encryption schemes. To overcome the cloud service provider's (CSP) ultimate authority over the data, the proposed scheme relies on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus to build a distributed network of processing CSPs based on the client requirements. After certain computations performed by all CSPs, they produce a master hash value for their database. To ensure immutable data is produced, master hash values are preserved in Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain networks. The master hash values can be obtained by tracking the block header address for verification purposes. A theoretical analysis of the overhead costs associated with creating master hash values for each of the cryptocurrencies is presented. We found that Ethereum leads to lower client financial costs and better online performance than Bitcoin. We also specify the data security requirements the proposed scheme provides, the ground-level implementation, and future work. The proposed verification scheme is based on public cryptocurrency as a back-end service and does not require additional setup actions by the client other than a wallet for the chosen cryptocurrency. © 2013 IEEE.",Blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; homomorphic encryption,Bitcoin; Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Cost benefit analysis; Cryptography; Ethereum; Fault tolerance; Security of data; Web services; Byzantine fault tolerance; Cloud computing environments; Cloud service providers; Distributed networks; Homomorphic Encryption Schemes; Integrated architecture; On-line performance; Security requirements; Blockchain,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant LRGS/MRUN: 203.PKOMP.6777005.,"Agarwal, V., Kaushal, A.K., Chouhan, L., A survey on cloud computing security issues and cryptographic techniques (2020) Social Networking and Computational Intelligence, pp. 119-134. , Singapore: Springer; https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/security-guidance-v4/, Cloud Security Alliance.

The number of qubits and ancilla bits used to design the quantum circuit is questionable as it impacts the cost of the circuit. This study proposes a compact and efficient quantum circuit for simplified DES which utilizes the lowest number of qubits and ancilla bits. The key generation steps are fused so as to maintain the essence of the algorithm and at the same time make the circuit compact. Key and plaintext is mixed without the help of ancilla bits. The results show that nineteen qubits and seven ancilla bits along with polynomial number of quantum gates are sufficient to implement simplified DES on quantum circuit. Quantum attacks are conducted on the proposed circuit using Grover’s algorithm for key search as it acts as the black box for quantum search. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Block cipher; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation,Qubits; Timing circuits; Key generation; Polynomial number; Post quantum; Quantum circuit; Quantum gates; Quantum search; Reversible circuits; Symmetric crypto systems; Electric network analysis,,,,,,,"Markov, I.L., Saeedi, M., (2013) Phys.

We address this problem by proposing a hash function based on a chaotic sponge construction and DNA sequence. DNA sequence is used to design state transition rules of a deterministic chaotic finite-state automata (DCFSA), a chaotic structure that enhances the chaoticity of digital chaotic maps. We use a DCFSA configuration consisting of four states associated with logistic maps. Analysis shows that the DCFSA configuration is efficient and has high chaotic complexity. Both DCFSA and DNA are used to design the sponge-based hash function. An input message is transformed into a DNA sequence and divided into fixed-length blocks. Each block is absorbed into a sponge structure via DNA-XOR. The sponge state is then updated with a new DNA sequence by iterating DCFSA as a compression function. Statistical evaluations indicate that the proposed hash function has near-ideal diffusion, confusion, collision resistance and distribution properties. The proposed hash can also extend the provably secure notions of the sponge construction, specifically the indifferentiability from random oracles. Furthermore, the hash function has a high level of performance as compared to other chaos-based hash functions. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaotic map DNA data integrity finite state automata hash function security,Chaotic systems; DNA sequences; Hash functions; Chaotic structure; Collision resistance; Compression functions; Distribution property; Indifferentiability; Provably secure; Sponge structures; Statistical evaluation; DNA,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: LRGS/MRUN:203,This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant LRGS/MRUN:203.PKOMP.6777005.,"Alawida, M., Teh, J.S., Samsudin, A., Alshoura, W.H., An image encryption scheme based on hybridizing digital chaos and finite state machine (2019) Signal Process., 164, pp. 249-266. , Nov; Ismail, S.M., Said, L.A., Radwan, A.G., Madian, A.H., Abu-ElYazeed, M.F., A novel image encryption system merging fractional-order edge detection and generalized chaotic maps (2020) Signal Process., 167. , Feb; Jamal, S.S., Anees, A., Ahmad, M., Khan, M.F., Hussain, I., Construction of cryptographic S-boxes based on mobius transformation and chaotic tent-sine system (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 173273-173285; Razaq, A., Alolaiyan, H., Ahmad, M., Yousaf, M.A., Shuaib, U., Aslam, W., Alawida, M., A novel method for generation of strong substitutionboxes based on coset graphs and symmetric groups (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 75473-75490; Alshoura, W.H., Zainol, Z., Teh, J.S., Alawida, M., A new chaotic image watermarking scheme based on SVD and IWT (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 43391-43406; Alawida, M., Samsudin, A., Teh, J.S., Enhanced digital chaotic maps based on bit reversal with applications in random bit generators (2020) Inf.

In October 2014, Zhu et al. presented an increasingly proficient ABE with the hardness of ring-learning with error (R-LWE), so-called as ABER - L W E scheme. The ABER - L W E scheme is assured under the selective-set model, and it can be further achieved the shortest vector problem (SVP) in the worst case of ideal lattices problem. However, there is a noteworthy defect in the structure of the ABER - L W E scheme. The key generation algorithm that served as the core component of the ABER - L W E is defenseless against collusion attack. The contribution of this paper includes: (i) discusses the collusion attacks in the hardness of R-LWE problem. Subsequently, this paper demonstrates how the illegitimate users collude with other users by pooling their insufficient attributes together to recover a user’s private key and recover an encrypted message; (ii) suggests several alternatives to prevent such attacks in the ring-LWE lattice problem. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Attribute-based encryption; Collusion attacks; Lattice; Ring-learning with error (R-LWE),Hardness; Attribute-based encryptions; Collusion attack; Core components; Encrypted messages; Key generation; Lattice problems; Learning with Errors; Shortest vector problem; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Sahai, A., Waters, B., (2005) Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption, Advances in Cryptology–EUROCRYPT 2005, pp. 457-473. , https://doi.org/10.1007/11426639_27, LNCS, vol. 3494, R.

The entropy source is the unpredictable sequence of thread access when parallel threads attempt to access the same memory location, known as race condition or data races. Although prior work using the same entropy source exists, they either have low efficiency or insufficient security analysis. The novelty of this work lies in its use of chaotic networks capable of extracting entropy while postprocessing outputs simultaneously. These networks are formulated by coupling chaotic maps in the form of chaotic coupled map lattices which have the capability to amplify minor uncertainties, leading to better performance as compared to other CPU-based TRNGs. We first perform experiments to depict the unpredictable nature of thread access due to race conditions through entropy and scale index analysis. Next, the proposed generator is scrutinized based on a standardized set of evaluation criteria which includes the use of multiple statistical test suites followed by an analysis of its non-deterministic property. We also perform an in-depth entropy analysis of the generator’s outputs and measure its degree of non-periodicity. Results indicate that the proposed chaos-based TRNG is fast, evenly distributed, and is secure enough for applications that have high security requirements. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",Chaotic map; Cryptography; Entropy; Multicore CPU; Parallel processing; Random number,,,,,,"Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM: FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Project Number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.","Cherkaoui, A., Fischer, V., Aubert, A., Fesquet, L., A self-timed ring based true random number generator (2013) IEEE 19Th International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC), 2013, pp. 99-106. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2013.15; Walker, J., (2001) Hotbits: Genuine Random Numbers, Generated by Radioactive Decay., , www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits, www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits; Kanter, I., Aviad, Y., Reidler, I., Cohen, E., Rosenbluh, M., An optical ultrafast random bit generator (2009) Nat.

They produce unpredictable, non-repeatable random sequences. However, most TRNGs require specialized hardware to extract entropy from physical phenomena and tend to be slower than PRNGs. These generators usually require post-processing algorithms to eliminate biases but in turn, reduces performance. In this paper, a new post-processing method based on hyperchaos is proposed for software-based TRNGs which not only eliminates statistical biases but also provides amplification in order to improve the performance of TRNGs. The proposed method utilizes the inherent characteristics of chaos such as hypersensitivity to input changes, diffusion, and confusion capabilities to achieve these goals. Quantized bits of a physical entropy source are used to perturb the parameters of a hyperchaotic map, which is then iterated to produce a set of random output bits. To depict the feasibility of the proposed post-processing algorithm, it is applied in designing TRNGs based on digital audio. The generators are analyzed to identify statistical defects in addition to forward and backward security. Results indicate that the proposed generators are able to produce secure true random sequences at a high throughput, which in turn reflects on the effectiveness of the proposed post-processing method. © 2020, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",audio; chaos theory; chaotic map; entropy; hyperchaos; post-processing; random number generator; security,Entropy; Number theory; Processing; Forward and backward securities; Hyperchaotic maps; Inherent characteristics; Physical phenomena; Postprocessing algorithms; Postprocessing methods; Pseudo random number generators; Specialized hardware; Random number generation,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

Security of the cipher depends on the strength of the key and the algorithm used to generate the keys. Many modern cryptographic algorithms are based on Number Theory, but in recent years an alternative approach has been studied which is based on Chaos Theory. Many properties of chaotic systems such as nonlinearity, randomness, and sensitivity to initial conditions bear resemblance to those required by cryptography such as diffusion and confusion. Implementations of chaos-based cryptosystems have been proposed by other researchers and yet the strength of these systems from a cryptographic point of view has not been thoroughly considered. This paper discusses the appeal of chaos-based cryptography, some of the researches already done, and the challenges that this approach faces to be established as a fully secure method for data security. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Chaotic systems; Computation theory; Number theory; Security of data; Alternate approaches; Chaos-based cryptography; Cryptographic algorithms; Fully secure; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Alvarez, G., Li, S., Some Basic Cryptographic Requirements for Chaos-Based Cryptosystems (2006) Int.

However, there is a lack of thorough comprehension of the deanonymise outcome in Tor attack studies. Comparing the attack outcome from one study to another could be ambiguous especially on the anonymity perspective. It is expected that with proper categorisation of the deanonymise outcome, comparison between Tor attack studies in deanonymise outcome perspective could be much more transparent and precise. Hence, this study aims to provide thorough classifications of the deanonymise outcome of Tor attack studies. To achieve that, an in-depth discussion on the anonymity principals that Tor is providing is presented. Then, a set of deanonymise outcome classification is being defined correspond to the current Tor’s deanonymise attack studies outcome. Finally, it can be revealed that over the years, communication entities correlation has received the most attention compared to other categories of the deanonymise outcome on Tor attack studies. © 2020 SERSC.",Anonymity; Attack; Deanonymize; Privacy; Security; Tor,,,,,,11800,"This research was supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia (KPM) for ??Security Model: Website Fingerprinting on darknet illegal marketplaces for transaction traffic identification using machine learning?

Thus, enhancing digital chaotic maps in terms of their chaoticity and statistical properties contributes towards the improvement of chaos-based cryptography. This paper proposes a bit reversal approach to address these issues. The proposed method modifies chaotic state values (represented as fixed point numbers) by reversing the order of their fractional bits. Experimental verification indicates that chaotic maps modified by the proposed approach depict better chaotic performance, have higher complexity and larger chaotic parameter range. These results exceed those of existing digital chaotic maps and other chaotification methods. The simplicity of the proposed bit reversal approach and the use of fixed point representation makes it easy to implement on any computing platform. This approach is also highly flexible as it does not require any external inputs, making it a universal method for enhancing any digital chaotic map. As a proof-of-concept, a pseudorandom bit generator (PRBG) was designed based on cascading chaotic maps modified by the proposed method. Simulation and security analysis indicate that the proposed PRBG is statistically random, has a uniform data distribution and high key sensitivity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Chaotification; Digital chaotic map; Fixed point arithmetic; Henon map; Logistic map; Pseudorandom bit generator,Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Fixed platforms; Lyapunov methods; Number theory; Chaotic map; Chaotification; Henon map; Logistic maps; Pseudorandom bit generator; Fixed point arithmetic,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6316280,This work has been supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6316280 .,"Addabbo, T., Alioto, M., Fort, A., Pasini, A., Rocchi, S., Vignoli, V., A class of maximum-period nonlinear congruential generators derived from the rényi chaotic map (2007) IEEE Trans.

The main task of the cryptographic hash function is to assure the integrity of the transmitted data. In this work, integrity verification methods for digital verses of the Holy Quran are proposed. The first method uses cryptographic hash functions and generate the hash table of the Holy Quran. SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash functions are chosen in this work. The second method is a single compression technique which manipulates data during the run time. The compression method makes use of the two bytes in Unicode UTF-8 for the Arabic characters set. The results show that for a digital copy of the Holy Quran encoded in Unicode UTF-8, the sizes of the hash tables generated by SHA256 and RIPEMD160 are 84.73% and 90.46% (6.55-fold and 10.48-fold) smaller respectively. The compressed version of the Holy Quran has a size of 47.24% (1.9-fold) smaller than the original copy. In addition, a second preimage attack on a hash table for the digital Holy Quran produced by using CRC32 hash function is conducted to study the impact of such attacks on the two hash tables proposed in this work. © 2018 The Authors",Authentication; Cryptography; Data integrity; Hash function; Holy Quran,,,,,,,,"(2013), pp. 250-253. , AlAhmad, Mohammad A., Imad, Alshaikhli, Amal E.

Enhancing chaotic complexity of simple one-dimensional (1D) chaotic maps has been a popular topic of research in recent years. However, most of the proposed methods have low complexity and are not suitable for practical applications. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a novel approach known as deterministic chaotic finite-state automata (DCFSA). Existing 1D chaotic maps are associated with deterministic finite automata states. Then, a transition rule dynamically selects which 1D chaotic map to compute. DCFSA allows the creation of a large number of possible chaotic configurations with enhanced nonlinearity while retaining the computational complexity comparable to a 1D map. Theoretical and performance analyses show that DCFSA provides a larger chaotic parameter range, higher nonlinearity and chaotic complexity, as well as longer cycle length as compared to its underlying 1D chaotic maps. Moreover, performance comparison against other existing chaotification methods demonstrates DCFSA’s superiority. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Deterministic finite-state automata (DFSA); Digital chaotic map; Logistic map; Sine map; Tent map,Lyapunov methods; One dimensional; Chaotic map; Chaotic parameter range; Deterministic finite automata; Deterministic finite state automata; Logistic maps; Optimization algorithms; Performance comparison; Tent map; Chaotic systems,,,,,"203

Chaotic systems are used to design image ciphers due to properties such as ergodicity and initial condition sensitivity. A chaos-based cipher derives its security strength from its underlying digital chaotic map, thus a more complex map leads to higher security. This paper introduces an enhancement to a tent map's chaotic properties by hybridizing it with a deterministic finite state machine. We denote the resulting digital one-dimensional chaotic system as TM-DFSM. Chaotic analyses indicate that the new chaotic system has higher nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial condition, and larger chaotic parameter range than other recently proposed one-dimensional chaotic systems. We then propose a new image encryption scheme based on TM-DFSM, capable of performing both confusion and diffusion operations in one pass while also having a flexible key space. The encryption operations are designed to achieve maximal confusion and diffusion properties. Changing a single bit of the plainimage or secret key will result in an entirely different cipherimage. The proposed cipher has been analyzed using histogram analysis, contrast analysis, local Shannon entropy, resistance against differential cryptanalysis, and key security. Performance comparison with other recent schemes also depicts the proposed cipher's superiority. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Chaos theory; Cryptography; Deterministic finite state machine; Fixed-point number; Image encryption; Tent map,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Functions; Image processing; Chaotic parameter range; Deterministic finite state machines; Differential cryptanalysis; Fixed-point numbers; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Tent map; Cryptography,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6316280,This work has been supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6316280 .,"Teh, J.S., Tan, K., Alawida, M., A chaos-based keyed hash function based on fixed point representation (2018) Cluster Comput., pp. 1-12; Hua, Z., Jin, F., Xu, B., Huang, H., 2D logistic-sine-coupling map for image encryption (2018) Signal Process., 149, pp. 148-161; Zhongyun Hua, Y.Z., Yi, S., Medical image encryption using high-speed scrambling and pixel adaptive diffusion (2018) Signal Process., 149, pp. 148-161; Wang, Y., Wong, K.-W., Liao, X., Chen, G., A new chaos-based fast image encryption algorithm.

Digital chaos is one of the areas used to design image ciphers due to its many desirable properties such as ergodicity, initial state sensitivity and unpredictability. This paper proposes a new image cipher based on the perturbation of a new hybrid chaotic system. The proposed hybrid system cascades and combines two chaotic maps as part of a new chaotification method. Chaotic performance evaluation indicates that the new hybridization method has better complexity, higher sensitivity, and a larger chaotic parameter range as compared to other recently proposed chaotification methods. The new chaotic system is then used in the design of a new image cipher. Both confusion and diffusion properties are attained based on perturbing the chaotic states and system parameters, which are then involved in pixel shuffling and substitution operations respectively.

This paper introduces a hybrid chaotic system that enhances the dynamical behaviour of these maps to overcome this problem. The proposed system uses cascade and combination methods as a nonlinear chaotification function. To depict the capability of the proposed system, we apply it to classical chaotic maps and analyse them using theoretical analysis, conventional, fractal and randomness evaluations. Results show that the enhanced maps have a larger chaotic range, low correlation, uniform data distribution and better chaotic properties. As a proof of concept, simple pseudorandom number generators are then designed based on a classical map and its enhanced variant. Security comparisons between the two generators indicate that the generator based on the enhanced map has better statistical properties as compared to its classical counterpart. This finding showcases the capability of the proposed system in improving the performance of chaos-based algorithms. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Chaotic map; Dynamical degradation; Logistic map; Pseudorandom number generator; Sine map; Unimodal map,Cryptography; Lyapunov methods; Number theory; Random number generation; Chaotic map; Chaotic properties; Classical counterpart; Dynamical behaviours; Logistic maps; Pseudo random number generators; Statistical properties; Unimodal map; Chaotic systems,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702212

This paper proposes a new chaotification method that enhances the chaotic complexity of existing chaotic maps to surmount these issues. The proposed method uses a cosine function alongside a chaotic map in a cascade system. To depict its advantages, we apply it to enhance logistic and Henon maps before analyzing their chaotic properties. Results and comparisons indicate that the new chaotic maps have a wider chaotic range, elevated sensitivity, complex characteristics, high nonlinearity, and an extended cycle length as compared to the original (seed) maps as well as other chaotic maps. We then utilize the modified maps (and their corresponding seed maps) to design simple pseudorandom number generators to study their feasibility when used in cryptographic algorithms. We perform comparisons between the generators derived from both the original and seed maps. Results show that generators based on the new maps outperform their seed counterparts in nearly every aspect. This finding demonstrates the capability of the proposed method in improving the performance of chaos-based cryptographic algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaos theory; Cosine function; cryptography; Henon map; logistic map; Pseudo random number generator,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Cosine transforms; Cryptography; Functions; Lyapunov methods; Number theory; Chaotic properties; Complex characteristics; Cosine functions; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic applications; Henon map; Logistic maps; Pseudo random number generators; Random number generation,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6316280,This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant 304/PKOMP/6316280 and in part by the Malaysia Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant 203.PKOMP.6711801.,"Ivancevic, V.G., Ivancevic, T.T., (2008) Complex Nonlinearity: Chaos, Phase Transitions, Topology Change and Path Integrals, , Springer; Teh, J.S., Tan, K., Alawida, M., A chaos-based keyed hash function based on fixed point representation (2019) Cluster Comput, 22 (2), pp. 649-660; Alzaidi, A.A., Ahmad, M., Doja, M.N., Al Solami, E., Beg, M.M.S., A new 1D chaotic map and -hill climbing for generating substitutionboxes (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 55405-55418; Al Solami, E., Ahmad, M., Volos, C., Doja, M., Beg, M., A new hyperchaotic system-based design for efficient bijective substitution-boxes (2018) Entropy, 20 (7), p. 525; Hassan, M.F., Hammuda, M., A new approach for constrained chaos synchronization with application to secure data communication (2019) J.

That is because to large similarity among their characteristics such as unpredictability and sensitivity to an initial condition. Moreover, chaotic maps are a source of entropy that provide diffusion and confusion strength in cryptographic applications. Although existing one dimensional chaotic maps are widely used, many security issues are found in their behaviors. This paper tackles those issues through the new proposed solution model that uses bitstream dividing model. The proposed model uses the fixed-point format to extract bitstream and dividing a chaotic state into N equal parts, each part is a new chaotic state. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, the unimodal maps are used in the simulation, it is shown that the proposed model has better chaotic complexity and performance than the corresponding maps. Moreover, it is a simple structure but effective and can be used as a chaotification model to generate digital chaos. In chaos-based cryptography, the enhanced maps have a better security strength which is highly needed for the development of chaos-based ciphers. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Digital chaotic map; Fixed-point format; Logistic map; Sine map; Unimodal map,Application programs; Binary sequences; Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Lyapunov methods; Chaos-based cryptography; Chaotic cryptography; Chaotic map; Cryptographic applications; Fixed points; Initial conditions; Logistic maps; Unimodal map; One dimensional,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304/PKOMP/6316280",This work has been supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6316280.,"Arroyo, D., Amigo, J.M., Li, S., Alvarez, G., On the inadequacy of unimodal maps for cryptographic applications (2010) XI Reuni´on Espanola Sobre Criptolog´Ia Y Seguridad De La Información (XI RECSI), pp. 37-42. , J.

The design is structured to utilize the lowest number of qubits. First, the main components of AES-128 are designed as quantum circuits and then combined to construct the quantum version of AES-128. Some of the most efficient approaches in classical hardware implementations are adopted to construct the circuits of the multiplier and multiplicative inverse in F2[ x] / (x8+ x4+ x3+ x+ 1). The results show that 928 qubits are sufficient to implement AES-128 as a quantum circuit. Moreover, to maintain the key uniqueness when the quantum AES-128 is employed as a Boolean function within a Black-box in other key searching quantum algorithms, a method with a cost of 930 qubits is also proposed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Block cipher; Circuit optimization; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation; Symmetric cryptography,Boolean functions; Hardware; Inverse problems; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Block ciphers; Circuit optimization; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulations; Symmetric cryptography; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Rivest, R.L., Shamir, A., Adleman, L., A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems (1978) Commun.

Also, a quantum Grover attack is modeled on the proposed quantum SAES. First, quantum circuits for the main components of S-AES in the finite field 2[x]/(x4 + x + 1), are constructed. Then, the constructed circuits are put together to form a quantum version of S-AES. A C-NOT synthesis is used to decompose some of the functions to reduce the number of the needed qubits. The quantum S-AES is integrated into a black-box queried by Grover’s algorithm. A new approach is proposed to uniquely recover the secret key when Grover attack is applied. The entire work is simulated and tested on a quantum mechanics simulator. The complexity analysis shows that a block cipher can be designed as a quantum circuit with a polynomial cost. In addition, the secret key is recovered in quadratic speedup as promised by Grover’s algorithm. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Block cipher; Grover attack; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation; Symmetric cryptography,Application programs; Data privacy; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Block ciphers; Grover attack; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulations; Symmetric cryptography; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Rivest, R.L., Shamir, A., Adleman, L., A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-key Cryptosystems (1978) Commun.

Existing Internet banking authentication mechanism that primarily relies on the conventional password-only authentication cannot efficiently resist to recent password guessing and password cracking attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposed an eXtended Honey Encryption (XHE) scheme by adding an additional protection mechanism on the existing user authentication mechanism. When the malicious user attempts to unauthorized access to online bank account by entering his guessed password, instead of rejecting the access, the XHE algorithm generates an indistinguishable bogus bank data, subsequently redirects attacker to fake user account, in which the attack could not determine whether the guessed password is working correctly or not. Therefore, increasing the complexity of password guessing and cracking attacks. This paper also provides an in-depth study of attack models on password-based authentication mechanism and their countermeasures. Subsequently, a preliminary study on Malaysian online banking authentication system is presented. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Authentication; Honey Encryption; Internet banking security; Password-based attack,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811334,"Acknowledgements This work was by a research grant from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [1001/PKOMP/811334].

ElGamal cryptosystem is relatively an expensive algorithm. For security guarantees, ElGamal cryptosystem requires modulo operation of large prime integer whose size range approximately from 1,024 to 4,096 bits. As a consequence of such requirement, the application of ElGamal cryptosystem is limited for securing only small messages such as secret keys. This paper aims to propose an efficient variant of ElGamal cryptosystem. The proposed scheme is designed based on quotient ring of polynomial, Z2[ x] / &lt; f(x) &gt;, where f(x) is an irreducible polynomial. The decryption algorithm was further optimized with the use of the multiplicative inverse of the generator g(x), which only generated once during the key generation algorithm, thus leading to a simpler and faster decryption process. The proposed scheme is as secure as the original ElGamal scheme, since both schemes are based on the DLP. The preliminary result shows that the proposed scheme minimizes complex arithmetic operations and achieves very practical performance compared to the classic ElGamal algorithm and its variants. The proposed F2n based ElGamal scheme outperforms the Fp based scheme by significantly reducing 69.74% of the numbers of required logic gates in the case study of VLSI implementation. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Binary fields; ElGamal; Polynomial modular arithmetic,Computation theory; Polynomials; Binary fields; Decryption algorithm; Discrete logarithm problems; ElGamal; ElGamal cryptosystem; Irreducible polynomials; Modular arithmetic; Multiplicative inverse; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Elgamal, T., A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms (1985) IEEE Trans.

The internet provides an unsecured channel in which hundreds of terabytes of data is being transmitted daily. Computer and software systems rely on encryption algorithms such as block ciphers to ensure that sensitive data remains confidential and secure. However, adversaries can leverage the statistical behavior of underlying ciphers to recover encryption keys. Accurate evaluation of the security margins of these encryption algorithms remains to be a big challenge. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing several searching strategies based on differential cryptanalysis. By clustering differential paths, the searching algorithm derives more accurate distinguishers as compared to examining individual paths, which in turn provides a more accurate estimation of cipher security margins. We verify the effectiveness of this technique on ciphers with the generalized Feistel and SPN structures, whereby the best distinguishers for each of the investigated ciphers were obtained by discovering clusters with thousands of paths. With the KATAN block cipher family as a test case, we also show how to apply the searching algorithm alongside other cryptanalysis techniques such as the boomerang attack and related-key model to obtain the best cryptanalytic results. This also depicts the flexibility of the proposed searching scheme, which can be tailored to improve upon other differential attack variants. In short, the proposed searching strategy realizes an automated security evaluation tool with higher accuracy compared to previous techniques. In addition, it is applicable to a wide range of encryption schemes which makes it a flexible tool for both academic research and industrial purposes. © 1968-2012 IEEE.",Accurate security margin; active s-box; branch and bound algorithm; differential path searching; KATAN; LBlock; PRESENT; TWINE,Branch and bound method; Clustering algorithms; Industrial research; Lyapunov methods; Network security; Security of data; Twine; active s-box; Branch-and-bound algorithms; differential path searching; KATAN; LBlock; PRESENT; Security margins; Cryptography,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 15K16005",,"Chen, J., Teh, J.S., Su, C., Samsudin, A., Fang, J., Improved (related-key) attacks on round-reduced KATAN-32/48/64 based on the extended boomerang framework (2016) Proc.

This paper aims to investigate the security the DNA-based image encryption algorithm and its resistance against chosen plaintext attack. The results of the analysis demonstrate that security of the algorithm mainly relies on one static shuffling step, with a simple confusion operation. In this study, a practical plain image recovery method is proposed, and it is shown that the images encrypted with the same key could easily be recovered using the suggested cryptanalysis method with as low as two chosen plain images. Also, a strategy to improve the security of the algorithm is presented in this paper. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chosen plaintext attack; Cryptanalysis; DNA encoding; Image encryption; Security; Shuffling,Bioinformatics; DNA; Encoding (symbols); Image processing; Public key cryptography; Signal encoding; Chosen-plaintext attack; Cryptanalysis; DNA encoding; Image encryptions; Security; Shuffling; Cryptography,,,,,,,"El Assad, S., Farajallah, M., A new chaos-based image encryption system (2015) Signal Process.: Image Commun., 41, pp. 144-157; El-latif, A.A.A., Li, L., Wang, N., Han, Q., Niu, X., A new approach to chaotic image encryption based on quantum chaotic system, exploiting color spaces (2013) Signal Process., 93 (11), pp. 2986-3000; François, M., Grosges, T., Barchiesi, D., Erra, R., A new image encryption scheme based on a chaotic function (2012) Signal Process.: Image Commun., 27 (3), pp. 249-259; Li, X., Li, C., Lee, I.-K., Chaotic image encryption using pseudo-random masks and pixel mapping (2015) Signal Process., pp. 1-16; Mohammad Seyedzadeh, S., Mirzakuchaki, S., A fast color image encryption algorithm based on coupled two-dimensional piecewise chaotic map (2012) Signal Process., 92 (5), pp. 1202-1215; Li, S., Li, C., Chen, G., Bourbakis, N.G., Lo, K.-T., A general quantitative cryptanalysis of permutation-only multimedia ciphers against plaintext attacks (2008) Signal Process.: Image Commun., 23 (3), pp. 212-223; Kadir, A., Hamdulla, A., Guo, W.-Q., Color image encryption using skew tent map and hyper chaotic system of 6th-order cnn (2014) Optik – Int.

It also synchronizes communication between two parties. However, there are many cryptanalytic attacks that exploit weaknesses in the IV setup of stream ciphers. In an effort to solve this problem, we introduce a chaos-based stream cipher that utilizes a new mode of synchronization called true random synchronization (TRSync). The stream cipher is designed based on spatiotemporal chaos while taking advantage of TRSync to resist various statistical attacks. The stream cipher operations also include data-dependent rotations and chaotic perturbation. As chaotic functions are inherently slow due to floating point operations, we utilize fixed point representation for higher efficiency. TRSync includes a true random number sequence (TRNS) into the synchronization process alongside the public IV. The IV is masked by the TRNS before being used to setup the cipher. Therefore, the cipher's internal state cannot be manipulated by an attacker and constantly changes even if the secret key-IV pairs are constant. TRSync can also be used to secure other stream ciphers with IVs as described in this paper. The security of the proposed chaotic cipher is thoroughly analyzed in terms of randomness, periodicity, entropy, balance, correlation, and complexity. © 2017 IETE.",Chaos; Cryptography; Encryption; Initialization vector; Stream cipher; Tent map,Chaos theory; Digital arithmetic; Synchronization; Cryptanalytic attacks; Data-dependent rotations; Floating point operations; Initialization vectors; Spatiotemporal chaos; Stream Ciphers; Synchronization process; Tent map; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Ekdahl, P., Johansson, T., A new version of the stream cipher SNOW (2003) Proc. of Selected Areas in Cryptogr.

However, there is a rising concern on its security. While recent cloud solutions focus on the password-based cryptography, in which a secret key is derived from user’s password, password-based authentication cannot efficiently withstand to password-based attack such as brute-force and dictionary attacks. First, this paper reviews the attack models and security defenses mechanisms of existing public cloud service providers. Subsequently, this paper extends the Honey Encryption scheme to enhance the file storage security on the public cloud computing. The Honey Encryption provides the encrypted data an additional protection layer by providing fake data in response to every incorrect guess on the user’s password. These fake data resemble the actual data and indistinguishable from the attacker’s perspective, therefore hardening the complexity of password guessing. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Brute-force attack; Honey encryption; Password-based encryption; Secure cloud,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811334,This work was by a research grant from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [1001/PKOMP/811334].

Several security models and architectures that targeted to a specific IoT architecture, end-point devices, heterogeneous networks and applications have been proposed recently. As the IoT architecture diversifies, these conventional security mechanisms which had been constructed based on point-to-point security defenses, however, are now becoming less effective against the new cyber Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attacks and malicious insider attacks. In this paper, a data centric security approach—Ciphertext Policy-Attribute based Encryption (CP-ABER-LWE) scheme is proposed to protect directly on the data itself—wherever it goes—over its whole lifecycle (data-in-transit, data-in-transform and dataat- rest). Compared to the traditional public key cryptography, the proposed scheme provides a fine-grained access control directly on the encrypted data without the need of having trusted Access Control Systems (ACS), therefore better in supporting the scalability and interoperability issues of the IoT architecture. Subsequently, this paper also demonstrates the applicability of the proposed CP-ABER-LWE scheme in securing the cloud centric IoT. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Access control; Attribute based encryption; Data centric approach; Internet of things (IoT),,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811334,This work was supported by a research grant from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [1001/PKOMP/811334].,"Gómez-Goiri, A., López-De-Ipiña, D., On the complementarity of triple spaces and the web of things (2011) Proceeding of 2Nd International Workshop on Web of Things, , New York, USA; Ning, H., Wang, Z., (2011) IEEE Communicat.

Through these functionalities, Smartphone owner can exchange information to each other by sharing links or even files. However, an attacker see these as an advantage to perform an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT is an attack which incorporates both social engineering attack and malware. In this paper, the authors will shed light on how APT attack through spear phishing can occur in Smartphone and how to detect it. First, the authors will examine the tactics that can be used by the attacker to perform a successful social engineering attack. Then, based on the discussion that has been made, the authors have used a machine learning algorithm to classify whether a certain URL is a phish or not. Lastly, the authors have evaluated the propose technique using machine learning and obtained more than 90% accuracy. This proves, that the proposed technique would able to help mitigating APT attack through spear phishing in the Smartphone. © 2018 The Authors.",Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Cyber Crime; Decision Tree; Smart Phone; Typosquat,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Decision trees; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Smartphones; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Attack detection; Cyber-crimes; Multi-purpose; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Typosquat; Malware,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.,"APT Research Team TrendLab, Spear-phishing email: Most favored apt attack bait (research paper), Report (2012); Baumgartner, K., Raiu, C., Maslennikov, D., (2013) Android Trojan Found in Targeted Attack, , https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/35552/android-trojan-found-in-targeted-attack-58/, [Online].

Similar to MGNAF, MGSDNAF reduces the integer's Hamming Weight better than the GNAF, a well-known integer representation method. With a reduced Hamming Weight, exponentiations can be quickly calculated. Moreover, contrary to MGNAF, the digit set size in the proposed method is smaller; and therefore improved the memory usage in point multiplication -an operation that is highly used in the calculation of pairing-based cryptosystems.",Cryptography; Generalized NAF; Hamming weight; Radix-r representation,,,,,,"FRGS-203/PKOMP/6711427

AEAD schemes provide authentication for a message that is divided into two parts: associated data which is not encrypted and the plaintext which is encrypted. However, there is a lack of chaos-based AEAD schemes in recent literature. This paper introduces a new 128-bit chaos-based AEAD scheme based on the single-key Even-Mansour and Type-II generalized Feistel structure. The proposed scheme provides both privacy and authentication in a single-pass using only one 128-bit secret key. The chaotic tent map is used to generate whitening keys for the Even-Mansour construction, round keys, and random s-boxes for the Feistel round function. In addition, the proposed AEAD scheme can be implemented with true random number generators to map a message to multiple possible ciphertexts in a nondeterministic manner. Security and statistical evaluation indicate that the proposed scheme is highly secure for both the ciphertext and the authentication tag. Furthermore, it has multiple advantages over AES-GCM which is the current standard for authenticated encryption. © 2017 J. S. Teh and A.

This representation is the enhanced and modified version of a well-known recoding method called Generalized Non-Adjacent Form (G-NAF). Scanning the digits from the left-to-right is called Modified Generalized Signed Digit Non-Adjacent Form (MGSDNAF), which unlike the G-NAF, presents the 'nice property' to be obtained. A 'nice property' is one that is based on intuition and is particularly desirable to be obtained in a given context. This processing direction is of great importance because a table of pre-computed values may be used to speed up the scalar multiplication only for that direction. A subsequent advantage is that recoding the exponent in advance is not required. This results in better performances in both running time and memory space. This representation method can reduce the Hamming Weight of integers from about 21.6% for radix 3 to 15.1% for radix 9. These numbers for G-NAF recoding are 16.7% and 8.9% respectively. Comparing these numbers together shows that efficiency of the proposed method in reducing the Hamming Weight is more than the efficiency of G-NAF, which is from 30% (for radix 3) to more than 65% (for radix 9) more efficient in reducing the Hamming Weight. Finally, two radix 3 single scalar multiplication methods for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which are based on G-NAF and Left-to-Right MGSDNAF, are compared in order to examine the application of the proposed method in cryptography. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the number of underlying arithmetic operations in single scalar multiplication by 14.1% while G-NAF can only reduce this number by 11.5%. © 2017 IJTech.",Cryptography; Elliptic curve; Generalized NAF (G-NAF); Hamming weight; Radix-r representation,,,,,,,,"Ciet, M., Joye, M., Lauter, K., Montgomery, P.L., Trading Inversions for Multiplications in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (2006) Designs, Codes, and Cryptography, 39 (2), pp. 189-206; Clark, W., Liang, J., On Arithmetic Weight for a General Radix Representation of Integers (1973) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 19, pp. 823-826; Eghdamian, A., Samsudin, A., A Modified Left-to-right Radix-r Representation (2015) 2015 International Symposium on Technology Management and Emerging Technologies (ISTMET), pp. 254-257; Eghdamian, A., Samsudin, A., An Improved Signed Digit Representation of Integers (2014) 3rd International Conference on Computer Engineering &amp; Mathematical Sciences, pp. 287-290; Eghdamian, A., Samsudin, A., MGSDNAF - A Modified Signed Digit Generalized Non- Adjacent Form for Integers Representation (2015) 2nd Advancement on Information Technology International Conference (ADVCIT); Eisentrager, K., Lauter, K., Montgomery, P., Fast Elliptic Curve Arithmetic and Improved Weil Pairing Evaluation (2003) Topics in Cryptology-CT-RSA, pp. 343-354; ElGamal, T., A Public Key Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme based on Discrete Logarithms (1985) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 31 (4), pp. 469-472; Fong, K., Hankerson, D., Lopez, J., Menezes, A., Field Inversion and Point Halving Revisited (2004) IEEE Transactions on Computers, 53 (8), pp. 1047-1059; Hankerson, D., Hernandez, J.L., Menezes, A., Software Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography over Binary Fields (Invited Talk) (2000) Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, pp. 1-24. , Springer; Joye, M., Yen, S.M., New Minimal Modified Radix-r Representation with Applications to Smart Cards (2002) Public Key Cryptography, 2274, pp. 375-383. , Naccache D., Paillier P.

Unlike their pseudorandom counterparts, TRNGs are more computationally expensive as they need to harvest entropy from physical phenomena. To generate high quality true random numbers at a fast rate, this paper introduces a new TRNG based on hyperchaos and digital sound. The characteristics of a hyperchaotic map such as sensitivity to initial conditions and complex behavior amplifies noise obtained by sampling environmental sound through a computer microphone. The random numbers generated are then evaluated using statistical test suites such as NIST SP 800-22, DIEHARD and ENT. Because nondeterminism cannot be proved by merely running test suites, entropy analysis is performed to determine the unpredictability of these sequences. Results show that the proposed TRNG can generate true random numbers at a high rate while maintaining strong statistical quality. In addition, the entropy source requires only an inexpensive computer microphone which is already built into many laptops and handheld devices. Therefore, the proposed generator provides a low-cost and easily obtainable option for applications that require true random numbers. © 2016 IEEE.",Audio sample; Chaotic map; Entropy; Security verification; True random number generator,Chaotic systems; Entropy; Information science; Microphones; Number theory; Programmable logic controllers; Audio samples; Chaotic map; Environmental sounds; Physical phenomena; Security verification; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Statistical quality; True randoms; Random number generation,,,,,,,"Walker, J., (2001) Hotbits: Genuine Random Numbers, Generated by Radioactive Decay, , www.formilab.ch/hotbits; Crȩt, O., Gyořfi, T., Suciu, A., Implementing true random number generators based on high fanout nets (2012) Romanian Journal of Information Science and Technology, 15 (3), pp. 277-298; Jun, B., Kocher, P., (1999) The Intel Random Number Generator; Teh, J.S., Samsudin, A., Al-Mazrooie, M., Akhavan, A., GPUs and chaos: A new true random number generator (2015) Nonlinear Dynamics, 82 (4), pp. 1913-1922. , July; Davis, D., Ihaka, R., Fenstermacher, P., Cryptographic randomness from air turbulence in disk drives (2001) Proc.

In this study, a quantum implementation of a classical block cipher is presented. A quantum circuit for a classical block cipher of a polynomial size of quantum gates is proposed. The entire work has been tested on a quantum mechanics simulator called libquantum. First, the functionality of the proposed quantum cipher is verified and the experimental results are compared with those of the original classical version. Then, quantum attacks are conducted by using Grover’s algorithm to recover the secret key. The proposed quantum cipher is used as a black box for the quantum search. The quantum oracle is then queried over the produced ciphertext to mark the quantum state, which consists of plaintext and key qubits. The experimental results show that for a key of n-bit size and key space of N such that N= 2 n, the key can be recovered in O(π4N) computational steps. © 2016, The Author(s).",Block cipher; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation; Symmetric cryptography,,,,,,,,"Akihiro, Y., Ishizuka Hirokazu quantum cryptanalysis of block ciphers.

However, this outsourced initiative introduces a number of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, homomorphic encryption is suggested as a mechanism to protect the confidentiality and privacy of outsourced data, while at the same time allowing third parties to perform computation on encrypted data. This paper also discusses the challenges of Big Data processing protection and highlights its differences from traditional data protection. Existing works on homomorphic encryption are technically reviewed and compared in terms of their encryption scheme, homomorphism classification, algorithm design, noise management, and security assumption. Finally, this paper discusses the current implementation, challenges, and future direction towards a practical homomorphic encryption scheme for securing outsourced Big Data computation. © 2016 KSII.",Big Data Security; Cloud Security; Homomorphic Encryption; Secure Outsourcing,Cryptography; Data handling; Digital storage; Security of data; Cloud securities; Cloud service providers; Data requirements; Encryption schemes; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic Encryption Schemes; Outsourced datum; Security and privacy; Big data,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811334,"This research was supported by a research grant from RUI, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [1001/PKOMP/811334].

It has been widely applied to successfully attack many existing ciphers. In this paper, we investigate an extended version of the boomerang attack and show that it is still a very powerful tool especially in the related-key setting. A new branch-and-bound searching strategy which involves the extended boomerang framework is then introduced. We provide an improved cryptanalysis on the KATAN family (a family of hardware-oriented block ciphers proposed in CHES 2009) based on the boomerang attack. In the related-key setting, we were able to greatly improve upon the previous results to achieve the best results, namely 150 and 133 rounds by far for KATAN48/64 respectively. For KATAN32 in the related-key setting and all KATAN variants in the single-key setting, our results are the best ones in the differential setting although inferior to the meet-in-the-middle attack. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Boomerang attack; Differential attack; KATAN32/48/64; Related-key attack,Cryptography; Boomerang attack; Differential attacks; Differential setting; Extended versions; KATAN32/48/64; Meet-in-the-middle attacks; Related key attacks; Searching strategy; Security of data,,,,,"203/PKOMP/6711427

However, these schemes are insufficient enough for supporting real-world applications due to inherent quadratic overhead problem in the use of Learning With Error (LWE). To solve this problem, this paper proposed a Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme from a more lightweight ideal lattice classes-Ring-Learning with Errors (Ring-LWE), that further called as CP-ABER-LWE scheme. Compared to existing R-LWE based ABE scheme, the proposed CP-ABER-LWE is capable to handle a monotone access structure and enjoys collusion resistance properties. We exploited Linear Secret Scheme (LSSS) to express a monotone access structure. For resist to collusion attack, we applied the private key randomization technique to blind the user's private key. The proposed scheme CP-ABER-LWE is further proven to be secure under the Decision Ring-LWEd,q,χ problem in the selective set model. © 2015 IEEE.",Attribute based encryption; Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE); Fine Grained Access Control; Lattice Cryptography; Linear Secret Scheme (LSSS); Ring-Learning with Error (Ring-LWE),Access control; Errors; Industrial management; Problem solving; Security of data; Attribute-based encryptions; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Fine grained; Learning with Errors; Linear Secret Scheme (LSSS); Cryptography,,,,,,,"Sahai, A., Waters, B., Fuzzy Identity-Based encryption (2005) LNCS, 3494, pp. 457-473. , 2; Goyal, V., Pandey, O., Sahai, A., Waters, B., Attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control of encrypted data (2006) Proc.13th ACM Conf.

Most TRNGs obtain randomness from physical phenomena such as radio noise, radioactive decay or thermal noise that are unpredictable. These applications usually require external hardware to extract entropy and convert them into digital signals. This paper introduces a TRNGs that utilizes graphics processing units as the source of entropy. Its unpredictable behavior is harnessed by computing chaotic maps that are highly sensitive to slight changes to their control parameters and have pseudo-random behavior. A simple post-processing function based on modular addition and XOR is then used to achieve an unbiased output. The security of the proposed TRNG is evaluated using statistical test suites such as the NIST SP 800-22, DIEHARD and ENT, as well as entropy analysis to determine unpredictability. Results indicate that the proposed TRNG has strong statistical quality of random numbers and high throughput without the need of external specialized equipment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Chaotic map; CUDA; GPU; Security evaluation; True random number generator,Balloons; Chaotic systems; Computer graphics; Entropy; Number theory; Program processors; Radio astronomy; Radioactivity; Chaotic map; CUDA; GPU; Security evaluation; True randoms; Random number generation,,,,,"203/PKOMP/6711427

However, many existing chaos-based algorithms are slow due to floating point operations. They are mostly sequential in nature and therefore cannot take advantage of multicore processors for faster speed. In this paper, a new chaos-based hash function is proposed that utilizes multiple instances of chaotic maps that run in parallel to improve hashing speed. Parallelization is realized using the baseline network that also strengthens the security of the hash function due to its shuffling mechanism. The combination of linear and nonlinear chaotic maps is used to provide a high level of sensitivity to initial conditions, confusion and diffusion characteristics as well as strong collision resistance. Results show that the proposed design has strong security strength with near-perfect statistical qualities and fast hashing speed that surpasses both chaotic hash functions and the MD5 hash function. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Hash function; Message authentication; Multi-stage interconnection; Piecewise nonlinear chaotic map; Tent map,Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Digital arithmetic; Lyapunov methods; Mobile security; Diffusion characteristics; Floating point operations; Message authentication; Multi stage; Piecewise nonlinear chaotic maps; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Shuffle exchange networks; Tent map; Hash functions,,,,,"203/PKOMP/6711427

This paper proposes a formalization of genetic algorithm method in order to detect hidden message on an analyzed text. Five metric parameters such as running time, fitness value, average mean probability, variance probability, and standard deviation probability were used to measure the detection performance between statistical methods and genetic algorithm methods. Experiments conducted using both methods showed that genetic algorithm method performs much better than statistical method, especially in detecting short analyzed texts. Thus, the findings showed that the genetic algorithm method on analyzed stego text is very promising. For future work, several significant factors such as dataset environment, searching process and types of fitness values through other intelligent methods of computational intelligence should be investigated. © 2015, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

It depends on the representation of the scalar k. The binary method is the standard unsigned method that is used to compute the elliptic-curve (EC) point Q=kP. Researchers found that it is not the most efficient way for implementing EC computations. Other recoding methods such as complementary recoding (CR), nonadjacent form (NAF), and mutual opposite form (MOF) were presented in order to enhance the efficiency of EC computations. Our ZOTEC method that is based on ZOT recoding method was proposed to accelerate the EC computations. ZOTEC can be computed right-to-left or left-to-right. The recoding process is also faster than NAF and as fast as CR and MOF if the binary conversion is included or excluded. ZOTEC method is more efficient than BIN, CR, MOF, and NAF methods in terms of field complexity and time complexity whenever a field inversion is more expensive than six multiplications for BIN, CR, and MOF, and 8.3 for NAF. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Elliptic-curve arithmetic; Non-Window recoding methods; Point multiplication; Signed binary representation; Single-scalar multiplication,Computer networks; Information systems; Elliptic curve arithmetic; Point multiplication; Recoding; Scalar multiplication; Signed binaries; Geometry,,,,,,,"Darrel, H., Alfred, J.M., Scott, V., (2003) Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, 332. , Springer-Verlag: New York; Eisentrager, K., Lauter, K., Montgomery, P.L., (2003), Fast elliptic curve arithmetic and improved Weil pairing evaluation.

However, Salsa20/7 is broken and Salsa20/12 is not as safe as before. Therefore, Salsa20 must completely perform all of the four rounds of encryption to achieve a good diffusion in order to resist the known attacks. In this paper, a new variant of Salsa20 that uses the chaos theory and that can achieve diffusion faster than the original Salsa20 is presented. The method has been tested and benchmarked with the original Salsa20 with a series of tests. Most of the tests show that the proposed chaotic Salsa of two rounds is faster than the original four rounds of Salsa20/4, but it offers the same diffusion level. © 2015 KIPS.",Chaos theory; Cryptography; Differential attacks; Hash function; Logistic map; Salsa20; Stream cipher,Chaos theory; Diffusion; Hash functions; Chaotic logistic maps; Differential attacks; Logistic maps; Salsa20; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,,,,,,,"De Canniere, C., Preneel, B., (2008) Trivium,"" in New Stream Cipher Designs, pp. 244-266. , Heidelberg: Springer; Bernstein, D.J., The Salsa20 family of stream ciphers (2008) New Stream Cipher Designs, pp. 84-97. , Heidelberg: Springer; Mukherjee, P., An overview of eSTREAM ciphers (2013) Centre of Excellence in Cryptology, , Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India; Crowley, P., Truncated differential cryptanalysis of five rounds of Salsa20 (2005) The eSTREAM Project, , Technical Report 2005/073; Aumasson, J.P., Fischer, S., Khazaei, S., Meier, W., Rechberger, C., New features of Latin dances: analysis of Salsa, ChaCha, and Rumba (2008) Fast Software Encryption, pp. 470-488. , Heidelberg: Springer; Fischer, S., Meier, W., Berbain, C., Biasse, J.F., Robshaw, M.J., Non-randomness in eSTREAM candidates Salsa20 and TSC-4 (2006) Progress in Cryptology-INDOCRYPT 2006, pp. 2-16. , Heidelberg: Springer; Stewart, I., Does God Play Dice?

However, there are several drawbacks to this approach, one of which is the risks resulted from the occurrence of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The goal of APT is to exfiltrate and leak important and sensitive corporate information through exploitation of vulnerabilities within BYOD environment. This paper addresses the APT issue via spear phishing attacks within BYOD environment, through the mediation provided by security policies. The devising of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security policies using ACPT includes the implementation of environment attributes along with the specification of proposed policy rules for organizations is proven to be the most suitable policy mechanism for BYOD environment. Guidelines in mitigating APT via spear phishing are briefly discussed as well. © 2015 The Authors.",Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT); OWASP risk rating methodology; Security policy; Spear Phishing,Computer crime; Data handling; Information systems; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Security systems; Access control policies; Bring your own devices; Corporate information; Mandatory access control; Policy mechanisms; Risk ratings; Security policy; Spear phishing; Access control,,,,,,,"Mahinderjit Singh, M., Security Attacks Taxonomy on Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) Model (2014) International Journal of Mobile, Network, Communication and Telematics (IJMNCT), , ISSN: 1839-5678; Pillay, A., Diaki, H., Nham, E., Senanayake, S., Tan, G., Deshpande, S., Does BYOD Increase Risks or Drive Benefits?, , Melbourne, The University of Melbourne; Li, F., A Detailed Analysis of An Advanced Persistent Threat Malware, , http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/detailed-analysis-advanced-persistent-threat-malware-33814, the SANS Institute, October 2011; (2011) Advanced Persistent Threats and Other Advanced Attacks White Paper, , Websense; Leavitt, N., Todays Mobile Security Requires a New Approach (2013) IEEE Computer Society Press Los Alamitos, , CA, USA, Volume 46 Issue 11, November 2013, pp 16-19, doi:10.1109/MC.;1; 2013.400; (2011) Advanced Persistence Threats: A Decade in Review, , http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_ADecadeInReview.pdf, Command Five Pty Ltd., June; Kim, S., Cho, D., Yeo, S., Secure Model against APT in m-Connected SCADA Network (2014) International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2014. , Article ID 594652, 8 pages, doi:10.1155/2014/594652; Wrinkler, V.J.R., Data Security in Cloud Computing - Part 3 Cloud Data Protection Methods, , http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278993&page_number=2, (August 8, 2011); Coyne, E., Weil, T.R., ABAC and RBAC: Scalable, flexible, and auditable access management (2013) IT Professional, 15 (3), pp. 0014-16; Muthukumaran, D., Schiffman, J., Hassanm, M., Sawani, A., Rao, V., Jaeger, T., Protecting the Integrity of Trusted Applications in Mobile Phone Systems, Security and Communication Networks (2009) Security Comm.

Improving the efficiency of public-key cryptosystem through speeding up calculation and using fewer resources are among the main goals of cryptography research. In this paper, we introduce new symbols extracted from binary representation of integers called Big-ones. We present a modified version of the classical multiplication and squaring algorithms based on the Big-ones to improve the efficiency of big integer multiplication and squaring in number theory based cryptosystems. Compared to the adopted classical and Karatsuba multiplication algorithms for squaring, the proposed squaring algorithm is 2 to 3.7 and 7.9 to 2.5 times faster for squaring 32-bit and 8-Kbit numbers, respectively. The proposed multiplication algorithm is also 2.3 to 3.9 and 7 to 2.4 times faster for multiplying 32-bit and 8-Kbit numbers, respectively. The number theory based cryptosystems, which are operating in the range of 1-Kbit to 4-Kbit integers, are directly benefited from the proposed method since multiplication and squaring are the main operations in most of these systems. © 2014 Shahram Jahani et al.",,,,,,,,,"Boudriga, N., Security of mobile communications (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (ICSPC '07), pp. ii-iii;

The Diffie Hellman key exchange allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel. However, one drawback of this algorithm is the inherently expensive exponential calculation that provides the needed one-way trapdoor mechanism. Hence, an alternative approach is proposed whereby the key exchange will no longer depend on the prime field instead the newly proposed algorithm will now depend on the binary field as it is known that binary field operations are inexpensive and provides notably faster computations. The result evidently shows that the binary field Diffie Hellman performs almost twice as fast as the prime field Diffie Hellman. In general, this result serves as an example in which the binary field can benefit the mainstream cryptography. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.",Binary field; Finite field; Public Key Cryptography (PKC); Secure key exchange,,,,,,,,"Scott, M., Optimal Irreducible Polynomials for GF(2^m)Arithmetic (2007) Cryptology EPrint Archive; Tausworthe, R.C., Random Numbers Generated by Linear Recurrence Modulo-Two (1965) Math.

During the last few years, considerable effort has been devoted to research on chaos-based hash functions. Nevertheless, the corresponding analysis of them lag far behind. In this paper, a new efficient scheme for parallel hash function based on high-dimensional chaotic map is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the confusion as well as the diffusion effect is enhanced significantly by utilizing two nonlinear coupling parameters. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme can satisfy all performance requirements of hash function such as desired statistical properties and strong collision resistance. At the same time, the proposed scheme can keep the parallel merit and message sensitivity with high potential to be adopted for network security. © 2013 Akhavan et al.; licensee Springer.",Hash function; High-dimensional chaotic map; Chaos-based cryptography,Diffusion effects; Efficient schemes; High potential; High-dimensional; Nonlinear coupling; Performance requirements; Statistical properties; Strong collisions; Chaos-based cryptography; Chaotic map; Chaotic systems; Security of data; Hash functions,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 1001/PICOMP/817059",This work was supported by USM (no. 1001/PICOMP/817059).,"Li, S., Analyses and new designs of digital chaotic ciphers (2003) Ph.D. Thesis, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, xi'An Jiaotong University, xi'An, China; Behnia, S., Akhshani, A., Ahadpour, S., Mahmodi, H., Akhavan, A., A fast chaotic encryption scheme based on piecewise nonlinear chaotic maps (2007) Phys.

Reducing the complexity of elliptic curve point multiplication of the form , which is the dominant operation in elliptic curve cryptography schemes, will reduces the overall complexity of the cryptographic protocol. The wBD is a new window-based elliptic curve multiplication method. It is based on new recoding method called window big-digit (wBD). The wBD is a bidirectional method that can be calculated in both directions based on the amount of the available memory.The available memory is invested in an efficient way since wBD has little number of precomputed points compared to other window methods wich make it more suitable for limited storage devices. The BD recoding method requires only one pass to transform the exponent k from its binary representation to its wBD representation. Moreover, the wBDkeys has the lowest zero-run length among other window methods. Finally, the number of elliptic curve operations in addition to the execution timeof wBD method is measured. Consequently, the wBD is efficient as other window-based methods.",Big-digit recoding; Public key cryptography; Single scalar EC multiplication; Window methods,,,,,,,,"Mimi, H., Samsudin, A., Jahani, S., (2013) Evaluating Composite EC Operations and Their Applicability to the On-the-fly and Non-window Multiplication Methods, , to appear; Solinas, J.A., Efficient arithmetic on Koblitz curves (2000) Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 19, pp. 195-249; Koyama, K., Tsuruoka, Y., Speeding up elliptic cryptosystems by using a signed binary window method (1993) Proceedings of the 12th Annual International Cryptology Conference on Advances in Cryptology, pp. 345-357; Blake, I.F., Seroussi, G., Smart, N.P., (1999) Elliptic Curves in Cryptography, , Cambridge University Press; Okeya, K., Schmidt-Samoa, K., Spahn, C., Takagi, T., Signed binary representations revisited (2004) Proceedings of CRYPTO'04, 3152, pp. 123-139; Moller, B., Improved techniques for fast exponentiation (2002) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, (2587), pp. 298-312. , Information Security and Cryptology - ICISC 2002; Schmidt-Samoa, K., Semay, O., Takagi, T., Analysis of fractional window recoding methods and their application to elliptic curve cryptosystems (2006) IEEE Transactions on Computers, 55 (1), pp. 48-57. , DOI 10.1109/TC.2006.3; Darrel, H., Alfred, J.M., Scott, V., (2003) Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, , Springer-Verlag New York, Inc; Gordon, D.M., A survey of fast exponentiation methods (1998) Journal of Algorithms, 27 (1), pp. 129-146; Morain, F., Olivos, J., Speeding up the computations on an elliptic curve using addition-subtraction chains (1990) Rairo-Informatique Theorique et Applications-Theoretical Informatics and Applications, 24, pp. 531-544; Kong, F.Y., Li, D.X., A note on signed binary window algorithm for elliptic curve cryptosystems (2005) Cryptology and Network Security, Proceedings, 3810, pp. 223-235; Miyaji, A., Ono, T., Cohen, H., Efficient elliptic curve exponentiation (1997) ICICS '97: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Information and Communication Security, 1334, pp. 282-290; Solinas, J.A., An Improved Algorithm for Arithmetic on a Family of Elliptic Curves (1997) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, (1294), pp. 357-371. , Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO '97; Avanzi, R.M., A note on the signed sliding window integer recoding and a left-to-right analogue (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3357, pp. 130-143. , Selected Areas in Cryptography - 11th International Workshop, SAC 2004; Muir, J.A., Stinson, D.R., New minimal weight representations for left-to-right window methods (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3376, pp. 366-383. , Topics in Cryptology - CT-RSA 2005 - The Cryptographers' Track at the RSA Conference 2005; Khabbazian, M., Gulliver, T.A., Bhargava, V.K., A new minimal average weight representation for left-to-right point multiplication methods (2005) IEEE Transactions on Computers, 54 (11), pp. 1454-1459. , DOI 10.1109/TC.2005.173; Moller, B., Fractional windows revisited: Improved signed-digit representations for efficient exponentiation (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3506, pp. 137-153. , Information Security and Cryptology - ICISC 2004: 7th International Conference, Revised Selected Papers; Muir, J.A., Stinson, D.R., Minimality and other properties of the width-w nonadjacent form (2006) Mathematics of Computation, 74 (253), pp. 369-384. , DOI 10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01769-2, PII S0025571805017692; Jahani, S., Samsudin, A., ZOT-binary: A new numbering system with an application on big-integer multiplication (2013) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology (JATIT), 48, pp. 029-040; Jahani, S., (2009) ZOT-MK: A New Algorithm for Big Integer Multiplication, , MSc MSc, Department of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang; Mimi, H., Samsudin, A., Jahani, S., Elliptic curve point multiplication algorithm using precomputation (2013) Security and Communication Networks, to Appear, , to appear; Brown, M., Hankerson, D., Lopez, J., Menezes, A., Software implementation of the nist elliptic curves over prime fields (2001) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, (2020), pp. 250-265. , Topics in Cryptology - CT-RSA 2001 The Cryptographers' Track at RSA Conference 2001 San Francisco, CA, USA, April 8-12, 2001 Proceedings; Gallagher, P., Foreword, D.D., Director, C.F., (2009) FIPS PUB 186-3 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication Digital Signature Standard (DSS); (2010) MIRACL Library, , http://www.shamus.ie/, Shamus, December 16","Mimi, H.; School of Computer Sciences, , Penang 11800, Malaysia; email: hani_mimi@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,11092750,,,,English,WSEAS Trans.

In this paper, we propose an improved version of the visual digital signature scheme with enhanced security. The improvement was made based on Yang's non-expansion visual cryptography technique and Boolean operations. The security of the improved version of the visual digital signature scheme is assured by the K-SAT (3-SAT and 4-SAT) NP-hard problem. This is to compare with the security of the existing scheme which is based on the difficulty of solving random Boolean OR operations. Besides improved in security the propose scheme is also efficient in generating shares, compared to the existing scheme where the probability of generating black shares is high.",Boolean operation; Digital signature; Non-expansion visual cryptography; Visual share,,,,,,,,"Barker, E., Barker, W., Burr, W., Polk, W., Smid, M., Recommendation for Key Management-Part 1: General (Revised) (2007) NIST Special Publication 800-57 (Computer Security), pp. 58-63; Borgulya, I., An Evolutionary Framework for 3-SAT Problems (2003) Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 10 (3), pp. 185-191; Bugacov, A., Galstyan, A., Lerman, K., Threshold Behavior in Boolean Network Model for SAT (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IC-AI-2003), , Las Vegas; Cetin, K.K., Implementation of ElGamal Digital Signatures in C/C++ (ECE 575 Project) (2002) Data Security and Cryptography, Electrical & Computer Engineering, , Oregon State University; Cook, S., The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures (1971) Proceedings of 3 rd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 151-158. , New York; Erickson, J., Lecture 21: NP-hardness (2009) Algorithms Course Materials (Revision), , http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/notes/21-nphard.pdf; Garey, M., Johnson, D.S., (1990) Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NPCompleteness, , W.

For such size of p, the normalChebyshev polynomial calculation speed will be slow and impractical. Thus, there is a need to improve the Chebyshev polynomial calculation before the polynomial can be used in mainstream cryptosystems. In this paper, two types of Chebyshev polynomial calculation models are being considered, the Matrix Algorithm and the Characteristic Polynomial Algorithm.This paper introduces new technique to improve both of these calculation models.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid of Karatsuba-Classical multiplication algorithm that is based on a Look-up table of ""Big-Digits"" representation. The Big-Digits representation is a more compact representation compared to the binary representation. Therefore, by using the Big-Digits representation, the number of sub-multiplication operations in a multiplication algorithm will reduce significantly. The results of this study show that the proposed multiplication algorithm, which is based on the Big-Digits representation, is faster than the classical, Karatsuba and the hybrid of Karatsuba- Classical multiplication algorithms in range of the public-key cryptography implementation.",Big-Integer calculation; Karatsuba multiplication algorithm; Public-key cryptography,,,,,,,,"Avanzi, R.M., Dimitrov, V., Extending Scalar Multiplication to Double Bases (2006) ASIACRYPT 2006., 4284, pp. 130-144. , Lai, X., Chen, K.

However, it does not provide authentication, which may lead to possible impersonation and eavesdropping threats. Negotiating keys using digital certificates may help secure the channel, but this method incurs extra maintenance cost. Verbal authentication utilizes the real-time nature of VoIP but it requires users to read and manually compare the authentication code. This study proposes a session identifier framework based on the Modified Vector Quantization (MVQ) method on real-time video frames for video communication in VoIP. After the selected image frames are averaged and quantized, the output of the MVQ process is a set of image metrics that serves as pre-shared keys for key agreement. The framework is certificate-less and users do not need to read the authentication code to the other user. The implementation is evaluated for accuracy and robustness towards network noise and frame conditions.",Cryptography; Eavesdropping; Multimedia security; VoIP,Authentication codes; Digital certificates; Eavesdropping; Multimedia security; Session identifiers; Session initiation protocol; Video communications; VoIP; Authentication; Cryptography; Internet telephony; Security systems; Voice/data communication systems; Vector quantization,,,,,,,"Dantu, R., Fahmy, S., Schulzrinne, H., Cangussu, J., Issues and challenges in securing VoIP (2009) Computers & Security, 28, pp. 743-753; Spalding, M., Deciding whether or not to use a third party certificate authority (2000) Network Security, 2000, pp. 7-8; Wang, C.-H., Liu, Y.-S., A dependable privacy protection for end-to-end VoIP via Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman and dynamic key changes (2010) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, , In Press, Corrected Proof; Liao, Y.-P., Wang, S.-S., A new secure password authenticated key agreement scheme for SIP using self-certified public keys on elliptic curves (2010) Computer Communications, 33, pp. 372-380; Yoon, E.-J., Yoo, K.-Y., Kim, C., Hong, Y.-S., Jo, M., Chen, H.-H., A secure and efficient SIP authentication scheme for converged VoIP networks (2010) Computer Communications, 33, pp. 1674-1681; Zimmerman, P., (2006) ZRTP: Extensions to RTP for Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement for SRTP, IETF Internet Draft; Zisiadis, D., Kopsidas, S., Tassiulas, L., VIPSec defined (2008) Computer Networks, 52, pp. 2518-2528; Hoque, S., Fairhurst, M., Howells, G., Deravi, F., Feasibility of generating biometric encryption keys (2005) Electronics Letters, 41, pp. 309-311; Butcher, D., Xiangyang, L., Jinhua, G., Security Challenge and Defense in VoIP Infrastructures (2007) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, 37, pp. 1152-1162; Zhe, C., Shize, G., Kangfeng, Z., Haitao, L., Research on Man-in-the-Middle Denial of Service Attack in SIP VoIP (2009) International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing, NSWCTC '09, pp. 263-266; Prowell, S., Kraus, R., Borkin, M., CHAPTER 6-Man-in-the-Middle (2010) Seven Deadliest Network Attacks, pp. 101-120. , Editted Boston: Syngress; Petraschek, M., Hoeher, T., Jung, O., Hlavacs, H., Gansterer, W., Security and usability aspects of man-in-the-middle attacks on ZRTP (2008) Journal of Universal Computer Science, 14, pp. 673-692; Bresciani, R., Butterfield, A., A formal security proof for the ZRTP Protocol (2009) International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, ICITST '09, pp. 1-6","School of Computer Sciences, , Penang, Malaysia",,,,,,,,19750080,,,,English,Int.

One of the fundamental arithmetic operations for such systems is the large integer multiplication. The efficiency of these cryptosystems is directly related to the efficiency of this large integer multiplication operation. Classical multiplication algorithm and Karatsubamultiplication algorithm, and their hybrid,are among the most popular multiplication algorithms used for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a hybrid of Karatsuba and a classicalbased multiplication algorithm, enhanced by a new number representation system. The new number representation, known as ""Big-Digits"",is used to carry out the sub-multiplication operation in the new multiplication algorithm. Big-Digits has a compact representation with lower Hamming weight. As the result, the number of sub-multiplication operations for the multiplication algorithm that is based on the Big-Digits representation is significantly reduced. Our results show that the proposed multiplication algorithmis significantly faster than the classical, Karasuba and the hybrid of Karatsuba-Classical multiplication algorithms within the implementation domain of the publickey cryptography. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Big-integer calculation; Hamming weight; Karatsuba multiplication algorithm; Public-key cryptography,Arithmetic operations; Compact representation; Cryptography algorithms; Hamming weights; Integer multiplications; Karatsuba multiplication; Multiplication algorithms; Number representation; Number theory; Public key cryptography; Algorithms,,,,,,,"Rivest, R., Shamir, A., Aldeman, L., A Methoed for Obtaining DigitalSignatures and Public-key Cryptosystems (1978) J.

With BDNS, a new non-redundant positional numbering system known as ZOT-Binary is proposed. ZOT-Binary has a low Hamming weight with an average of 23.8% nonzero symbols, and therefore is highly suitable for Big-Integer calculation, especially for Big-Integer multiplication. To harvest such benefit from the ZOT-Binary representation, a new Big-Integer multiplication algorithm, ZOT-CM, which is based on the Classical multiplication algorithm, is proposed. Our result shows that when compared with the Classical multiplication algorithm, ZOT-CM is about 12 times faster for multiplying 128 bits numbers and at least 16 times faster for multiplying numbers that are bigger than 32,000 bits long. Our result also shows that ZOT-CM is about 20 to 3 times faster than Karatsuba multiplication algorithm, for multiplying numbers that are ranging from 128 bits to 32,000 bits long. From the findings, it is clear that ZOT-CM is a valuable addition to Big-Integer multiplication algorithm, and it is also believed that ZOT-Binary representation can benefit many other Big-Integer calculations. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

A reliable security protocol and an authentication scheme are thus required to prevent the aforementioned threats. However, an authentication scheme often demands additional cost and effort. Accordingly, a security framework for known participants in VoIP communication is proposed in this paper. The framework is known as Randomness-Optimized Self-Securing (ROSS), which performs authentication automatically throughout the session by optimizing the uniqueness and randomness of the communication itself. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange and Salsa20 stream cipher are utilized in the framework correspondingly to secure the key agreement and the communication with low computational cost. Human intelligence supports ROSS authentication process to ensure participant authenticity and communication regularity. The results show that with marginal overhead, the proposed framework is able to secure VoIP communication by performing reliable authentication. © 2012 KSII.",Applied cryptography; Low-cost framework; Security & privacy protocol; Self-authentication; VoIP communication,Authentication; Costs; Internet telephony; Random processes; Voice/data communication systems; Applied cryptography; Authentication scheme; Communication framework; Communication regularity; Low costs; Privacy protocols; Self-authentication; Voice over Internet protocol; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Sicker, D.C., Lookabaugh, T., VoIP security: Not an afterthought (2004) Queue, 2, p. 56. , Article (CrossRef Link); Chandrashekar, J., Zhang, Z.L., Duan, Z., Hou, Y.T., Towards a service oriented internet (2006) IEICE Trans.

Most cryptographic hash functions have been based on the Merkle-Damgård construction, which converts a message with an arbitrary length into a fixed-length hash digest. The problem with the Merkle-Damgård construction is its computation time, which increases gradually as the input size increases when the processes run sequentially. In this paper, we proposed an alternative construction to reduce the computation time and improve the overall hashing efficiency. The proposed method is the Multi-Pipeline Hash Construction (MPHC), which presents overlapping execution between independent block functions. The MPHC runs in parallel on multi-core machines and enhances the hashing performance in terms of speedup and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the MPHC performs better than the Merkle-Damgård construction, and the security analysis proves that the MPHC produces better-quality hash digests than the Merkle-Damgård construction in terms of the randomness of the digest value. © 2012 ICIC International.",Hash function; Merkle-Damgård construction; Multi-pipeline hash construction (MPHC); Secure hash algorithm (SHA); Speedup,Computation time; Cryptographic hash functions; Data integrity; Hashing functions; Input size; Message authentication; Multi-core machines; Multi-pipeline hash construction (MPHC); Secure hash algorithm; Security analysis; Speedup; Hash functions; Security of data; Pipelines,,,,,,,"Merkle, R., (1979) Secrecy, Authentication, and Public Key Systems, , Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University; Merkle, R., A certified digital signature (1989) Advances In Cryptology - CRYPTO Proceedings, Lecture Notes In Computer Science, 435, pp. 218-238; Damgard, I., A design principle for hash functions (1989) Proc. of the 9th Annual International Cryptology Conference On Advances In Cryptology, pp. 416-427. , Springer-Verlag; Biham, E., Dunkelman, O., Framework for iterative hash functions HAIFA (2006) Proc. of the 2nd NIST Hash Functions Workshop, , Santa Barbara, CA, USA; Liskov, M., (2006) Constructing Secure Hash Functions From Weak Compression Functions: The Case For Non-Streamable Hash Functions, , http://www.cs.wm.edu/~mliskov/hash.pdf; Lucks, S., A failure-friendly design principle for hash functions (2005) Proc. of the 11th International Conference On the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security, 3788, pp. 474-494; Gauravaram, P., Millan, W., Dawson, E., Viswanathan, K., Constructing secure hash functions by enhancing Merkle-Damgard construction (2006) Proc. of the 11th Australasian Conference (ACISP), 4058, pp. 407-420. , Melbourne, Australia; Martin, J.W., Essence: A candidate hashing algorithm for the NIST competition (2008) Submission to National Institute of Standards and Technology, , http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha3/Roundl/submissions_rndl.html; Xiao, J., Zou, X., Liu, Z., Guo, X., A novel adaptive interpolation algorithm for image resizing (2007) International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 3 (6 A), pp. 1335-1345; Pongyupinpanich, S., Choomchuay, S., An architecture for a SHA-1 applied for DSA (2004) Proc. of the 1st Electrical Eng./Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications, and Information Technology Conference, pp. 133-136. , Thailand; Elkamchouchi, H.M., Nasr, M.E., Abdelfatah, R.I., A new secure and fast hashing algorithm (SFHA-256) (2008) Proc. of the 25th IEEE Xplore National Radio Science Conference, pp. 1-8. , Tanta; Chuah, C., Samsudin, A., Omega network hash construction (2009) Journal of Computer Science, 5, pp. 965-976; Stalling, W., (2011) Cryptography and Network Security Principle and Practices, , 5th Edition, Prentice-Hall; Gay, O., (2007) FIPS 180-2 Hash Algorithms SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 Implementation, , http://www.ouah.org/ogay/sha2; Marsaglia, G., (1996) The Marsaglia Random Number CDROM Including the Diehard Battery of Tests of Randomness, , http://www.stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard; Amdahl, G., Validity of the single-processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities (1967) Proc. of AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference, 30, pp. 483-485. , Atlantic; Gustafson, J., Reevaluating Amdahl's law (1988) Communications of the ACM, 31 (5), pp. 532-533; Camargos, A., Batalha, R., Martins, C., Silva, E.J., Soares, G.L., Superlinear speedup in a 3-D parallel conjugate gradient solver (2009) IEEE Transactions, 45 (3), pp. 1602-1605; He, J., Yao, X., Analysis of scalable parallel evolutionary algorithms (2006) Proc. of the IEEE Congress On Evolutionary Computation, pp. 427-434. , Vancouver, Canada; Kusic, D., Hoare, R., Jones, A.K., Fazekas, J., Foster, J., Extracting Speedup From C-code With Poor Instruction-level Parallelism (2005) Proc. of the 19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 15, pp. 2649-26418. , Denver, Colorado","Al-Wesabi, O.

Generally, data confidentiality is obtained by utilizing cryptography, to ensure the highest degree of protection to users. Cryptography is one of the trusted practical methods for performing information security. The main purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality by converting the sensitive private information (known as plaintext) into unreadable and useless form (known as ciphertext). When cryptography is mentioned, complicated computer algorithms based on advanced mathematics first come to mind. The majority of modern cryptography algorithms involve calculations which have to be carried out on a computer. Imagine a cryptography system without any cryptographic computations on the part of the decoders; such that the decryption can be accomplished by the human visual system. Such system can be used where computers or other decryption devices are scarce and unavailable. As for the encryption, such system also does not need complex computation and as such could be done by the simplest modern computers. In the last two decades, numbers of researchers have focused on developing cryptosystems which require comparatively less complex computation. Visual cryptography is a special technique of cryptography for sharing and encrypting data, especially images, in which it is based on the pixel level manipulation with Boolean operations. In visual cryptography, the encryption operation does not require complex computations and the decryption operation is performed only by the human visual system. In this survey, an overview of the visual cryptography models is reviewed, with their methods and schemes for binary (black-and-white) images.",Binary (black-and-white) image; Boolean OR operation; Human visual system; Pixel expansion; Probabilistic visual secret sharing; Shares; Visual cryptography,Binary (black-and-white) image; Boolean OR operation; Human Visual System; Pixel expansion; Shares; Visual cryptography; Visual secret sharing; Algorithms; Image processing; Pixels; Security of data; Surveys; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Naor, M., Shamir, A., Visual Cryptography (1995) Proceeding of Advance In Cryptology-EUROCRYPT'94, 950, pp. 1-12. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag; Jaafar, A., (2011) A New Visual Public-Key Cryptosystem Based On Non-Expansion Technique and Boolean Operations, , Ph.D. Thesis, School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM); Biham, E., Itzkovitz, A., Visual Cryptography with Polarization (1998) Proceeding of RUMP Session of CRYPTO'98, , www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/visual.ps.gz; Jessica, M.L., (2005) Covert and Multilevel Visual Cryptographic Schemes, , M.Sc. thesis, Florida Atlantic University, USA; Chan, C., Wu, Y., A Visual Information Encryption Scheme Based on Visual Cryptography and D-H Key Agreement Scheme (2008) International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 8 (4), pp. 128-132; Guo, C., Chang, C.C., Qin, C., Multi-Threshold Visual Secret Sharing (2012) Advance In Information Science and Service Science (AISS), 4 (4), pp. 195-201; Thekra, A., Zou, B.J., A Novel Non-Expansion Visual Secret Sharing Scheme For Binary Image (2010) International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications (JDCTA), 4 (6), pp. 106-114; Abdulla, S., New Visual Cryptography Algorithm for Colored Image (2010) Journal of Computing, 2 (4), pp. 21-25; Yan, W.Q., Jin, D., Kankanhalli, M.S., Visual Cryptography for Print and Scan Applications (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Symposium On Circuits and Systems, pp. 572-575; Patel, M.K., (2003) A Modernized Version of Visual Cryptography, , M.Sc. thesis, State University Libraries of Florida, USA; Hou, Y.C., Visual Cryptography for Color Images (2003) Pattern Recognition, 36 (7), pp. 1619-1629; Naor, M., Shamir, A., Visual Cryptography II: Improving the Contrast via the Cover Base (1996) Proceedings of Security Protocols Workshop LNCS, 1189, pp. 197-202; Blundo, C., Santis, A.D., Visual Cryptography Schemes with Perfect Reconstruction of Black Pixels (1998) Computer & Graphics, 12 (4), pp. 449-455; Blundo, C., de Santis, A., Stinson, D.R., On the Contrast in Visual Cryptography Schemes (1999) Journal of Cryptology, 12 (4), pp. 261-289; Blundo, C., Bonis, A.D., Santis, A.D., Improved Schemes for Visual Cryptography (2000) Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 24 (3), pp. 255-278; Eisen, P.A., Stinson, D.R., Threshold Visual Cryptography Schemes with Specified Whiteness Levels of Reconstructed Pixels (2002) Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 25 (1), pp. 15-61; Tzeng, W.G., Hu, C.M., A new Approach for Visual Cryptography (2002) Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 27 (3), pp. 207-227; Droste, S., New Results on Visual Cryptography (1998) Proceeding of Advances In Cryptology-CRYPTO'96, Lecture Notes In Computer Science, 1109, pp. 401-415. , Springer-Verlag; Ateniese, G., Blundo, C., Santis, A.D., Stinson, D.R., Constructions and Bounds for Visual Cryptography (1996) Proceedings of the 23rd International Colloquium On Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP '96), pp. 416-428. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science; Ateniese, G., Blundo, C., Santis, A.D., Stinson, D.R., Visual Cryptography for General structures (1996) Journal of Information and Computation, 129 (2), pp. 86-109; Shyu, S.J., Chen, M.C., Optimum Pixel Expansions for Threshold Visual Secret Sharing Schemes (2011) IEEE Transactions On Information Forensics and Security, 6 (3), pp. 960-969; Liu, F., Wu, C.K., Lin, X.J., A New Definition of the Contrast of Visual Cryptography Scheme (2010) Information Processing Letters, 110 (7), pp. 241-246; Liu, F., Wu, C.K., Embedded Extended Visual Cryptography Schemes (2011) IEEE Transactions On Information Forensics and Security, 6 (2), pp. 307-322; Blundo, C., Cimato, S., de Santis, A., Visual Cryptography Schemes with Optimal Pixel Expansion (2006) Theoretical Computer Science, 369 (1), pp. 169-182; Ito, R., Kuwakado, H., Tanaka, H., Image Size Invariant Visual Cryptography (1999) IEICE Trans.

In addition, the improved visual zero-knowledge proof of identity scheme is also efficient in generating shares without repeating the steps as was happening in the old scheme in order to avoid getting full black shares.

In this paper, we have proposed an image algorithm based on the combination of a one-dimensional polynomial chaotic map and a piecewise nonlinear chaotic map. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations, both confirm that the new algorithm possesses high security, robust fast encryption speed for practical image encryption and solves the problem of small key space. © 2010 The Franklin Institute.

The main objective of this paper is to produce an ergodic dynamical system which can be implemented in random number generators. In order to check the efficacy of pseudo random number generators based on this map, we have carried out certain statistical tests on a series of numbers obtained from the introduced hierarchy. The results of the tests were promising, as the hierarchy passed the tests satisfactorily, and offers a great capability to be employed in a pseudo random number generator. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However an important document such as visa is still handled manually which affects the accuracy and efficiency of processing the visa. Work on evisa is almost unexplored. Approach: This study provided a detailed description of a newly proposed e-visa verification system prototyped based on RFID technology. The core technology of the proposed e-visa verification system is based on Identity Based Encryption (IBE) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This research provided comparison between both methods in terms of processing time and application usability. Results: The result showed the e-visa verification system is highly flexible when implemented with IBE and on the other hand produces better processing speed when implemented with PKI. Conclusion: Therefore, it is believed that the proposed e-visa verification schemes are valuable security protocol for future study on e-visa. © 2010 Science Publications.",E-visa; Identity Based Encryption (IBE); Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),,,,,,,,"Boneh, D., Franklin, M., Identity-based encryption from the Weil pairing (2001) SIAM J.

Currently, most conventional digital signature schemes are based on mathematical hard problems. These mathematical algorithms require computers to perform the heavy and complex computations to generate and verify the keys and signatures. In 1995, Naor and Shamir proposed a visual cryptography (VC) for binary images. VC has high security and requires simple computations. The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative to the current digital signature technology. In this paper, we introduce a new digital signature scheme based on the concept of a non-expansion visual cryptography. A visual digital signature scheme is a method to enable visual verification of the authenticity of an image in an insecure environment without the need to perform any complex computations. Our proposed scheme generates visual shares and manipulates them using the simple Boolean operations OR rather than generating and computing large and long random integer values as in the conventional digital signature schemes currently in use.",Boolean OR operation; Digital signature scheme; DSA signature; RSA signature; Visual cryptography,,,,,,,,"Zhu, H., Li, D., Reseach on Digital Signature in Electronic Commerce (2008) The 2008 IAENG International Conference on Internet Computing and Web Services, pp. 807-809. , http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2008/IMECS2008_pp807-809.pdf, Hong Kong; Elfadil, N., Graphical and Digital signature Combination for fulfilling the cultural gap between traditional signature and current smart card digital certificate/signature (2005) 3 rd Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust, , Canada; Liu, V., Caelli, W., Foo, E., Visually sealed and digitally signed documents (2004) Proc.

Compression and encryption techniques are used to meet these requirements. Fractal geometric is one of the techniques that can combine both compression and encryption together. In this paper, we introduce a new idea of combining image compression and encryption based on fractal geometric. Presently, the fractal encryption and compression are done individually. This compression-encryption is proposed to satisfy a fast and secure image transmission. We propose to convert Mandelbrot set and compressed image into square matrix. The image is compressed by using Iterated Function System (IFS). Then, matrix operation is applied to encrypt the image. The preliminary results, both theoretical and experimental are encouraging. © 2010 IEEE.",Compression; Encryption; Fractal geometry; Iterated Function System; Square matrix,Compressed images; Data protection; Encryption technique; Fractal geometry; Iterated function system; Mandelbrot set; Matrix operations; Secure image transmission; Square matrices; Transmission speed; Fractals; Image compression; Network security; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Data Encryption Standard (DES) (1997) Technical Report, Federal Information Processing Standards, , National Bureau of Standards (U.S), Publication 46; Chang, C.C., Hwang, M.S., Chen, T.S., A new encryption algorithm for image cryptosystems (2001) Journal of Systems and Software, 58 (2), pp. 83-91. , September; Chen, G.R., Mao, Y.B., Chui, C.K., A symmetric image encryption scheme based on 3D chaotic cat maps (2004) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 21 (3), pp. 749-761. , July; Wallace, G.K., The JPEG still picture compression standard (1992) Consumer Electronics, IEEE Transactions, 38 (1), pp. 18-34. , February; Mandelbrot, B.B., (1983) The Fractal Geometry of Nature, , W.H.

The security of most of the zero-knowledge proof of identity protocols is based on complex mathematical algorithms and requires heavy computations for both parties involved, the prover and the verifier. Thus, the two parties must depend on computing devices (computers) to perform these computations. Visual cryptography is a special kind of the cryptography that does not require one to know the cryptography and the corresponding complex mathematical computations. In this paper, we propose a new method of zero-knowledge proof of identity based on a non-expansion visual cryptography to overcome the disadvantage of complex computation in the current zero-knowledge proof of identity protocols, thus overcoming the dependence on computing devices. © 2010 IEEE.",Boolean operation; Computational complexity; Visual cryptography; Zero-knowledge,Boolean operation; Boolean operations; Complex computation; Computing devices; Cryptographic algorithms; Current-zero; Identity verification; Identity-based; Mathematical algorithms; Mathematical computation; New approaches; Non-expansion; Visual cryptography; Zero knowledge; Zero knowledge proof; Computational complexity; Network protocols; Network security; Cryptography,,,,,,,"Jain, G., (2008) Zero Knowledge Proofs: A Survey.

They are commonly used for data integrity checking and data authentication. Most of the cryptographic hash functions are based on the Merkle-Damgård construction. The basic Merkle-Damgård construction runs over the input sequentially, which can lead to problems when the input size is large since the computation time increases linearly. Approach: Therefore, an alternative architecture which can reduce the computation time is needed, especially in today's world where multi-core processors and multithreaded programming are common. An Omega Network Hash Construction (ONHC) run parallel in multi-core machine has been proposed as an alternative to the existing hash constructions. Result: The ONHC performed better than the Merkle-Damgård construction. ONHC permutation architecture also showed improved security strength in term of digest value randomness when compared to Merkle-Damgård construction. Conclusion: Therefore, it is believed that the proposed ONHC is a valuable structure that can improve the performance of any hash function that can run on top of it. © 2009 Science Publications.",Hash function; Merkle-Damgård construction; Omega network; Secure hash function (SHA),,,,,,,,"Bal, H.E., Haines, M., Approaches for integrating task and data parallelism (1998) IEEE Concurr, 6, pp. 78-84. , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=614113; Elkamchouchi, H.M., Einarah, A.A.M., Hagras, E.A.A., (2006) A new Secure Hash Dynamic Structure Algorithm (SHDSA) for public key digital signature schemes, pp. 1-9. , Proceeding of the 23rd Radio Science Conference, Mar. 14-16, IEEE Xplore Press, Menoufiya.

In this paper, an algorithm for one-way hash function construction based on piecewise nonlinear chaotic map with a variant probability parameter is proposed. Also the proposed algorithm is an attempt to present a new chaotic hash function based on multithreaded programming. In this chaotic scheme, the message is connected to the chaotic map using probability parameter and other parameters of chaotic map such as control parameter and initial condition, so that the generated hash value is highly sensitive to the message. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm presented several interesting features, such as high flexibility, good statistical properties, high key sensitivity and message sensitivity. These properties make the scheme a suitable choice for practical applications. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Common secure group communications requires encryption/decryption for group re-keying process, especially when a group member is leaving the group. Approach: This study proposes secret keys multiplication protocol based on modular polynomial arithmetic (SKMP), which eliminates the need for the encryption/decryption during the group re-keying. Results: The implementation based on modular polynomial arithmetic over Galois Field GF(2n) offers fast re-keying process (about 50% faster than Secret Keys Multiplication Protocol (SKM) for 128 bit key) and compact key size representation against other secret keys multiplication protocols.

In order to understand the human intelligence on natural language, four major computational intelligence methods have been identified. They are bayesian, fuzzy logic, neural network, and genetic algorithm. This paper also presents a measurement tool to measure the natural language intelligent system properties based on steganalysis objectives. It can be learned that the more suitable intelligent systems to be applied in steganalysis domain properties are: neural network, genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic.",Computational intelligence; Intelligent steganalytic system; Natural language steganalysis; Steganalysis,Bayesian; Computational intelligence; Computational intelligence methods; Domain properties; Human intelligence; Intelligent steganalytic system; Measurement tools; Natural language steganalysis; Natural languages; Steganalysis; Fuzzy sets; Intelligent systems; Linguistics; Neural networks; Fuzzy logic,,,,,,,"Tanimoto, S.L., (1987) The Elements of Artificial Intelligence: An Introduction Using LISP, , Computer Science Press Inc., 1803 Research Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland 20850, ISBN -88175-113-8; Russell, S.J., Norvig, P., (1995) Artificial Intelligence, , Prentice-Hall, Inc; Chandramouli, R., Subbalakshmi, S.K., Current Trends in Steganalysis: A Critical Survey (2004) Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Conference (ICARCV), 2, pp. 964-967. , December 6 - 9, ISBN 0-7803-8653-1; Din, R., Samsudin, A., Computational Intelligence in Steganalysis Environment, Recent Advances in Information Security and Privacy (2008) Proceedings of the 7th WSEAS InternationalConferenceon INFORMATION SECURITY and PRIVACY (ISP '08), pp. 48-53. , World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society WSEAS Press, Cairo, Egypt, December 29 - 31, ISSN: 1790-5117 48 ISBN: 978-960-474-048-; Wong, M.L., Leung, K.S., An Efficient Data Mining Method for Learning Bayesian NetworksUsinganEvolutionary Algorithm-Based Hybrid Approach (2004) IEEE TransactionsOnEvolutionary Computation, 8 (4), pp. 378-404; Shetty, S., Song, M., Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks Using a Semantic Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach (2005) IEEE, pp. 454-458; Colace, F., Santo, M.D., A Bayesian Approach for Text Classification (2006) IEEE, pp. 1323-1326; Bai, J., Nie, J.Y., Cao, G., Integrating Compound Terms in Bayesian Text Classification (2005) Proceedings of International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI'05), pp. 598-601. , Compiègne University of Technology, France September 19 - 22; Shi, H.F., Fan, T.G., Zhang, G.L., Documents Categorization Based On Bayesian Spanning Tree (2006) IEEE Proceedings Of The Fifth International Conference On Machine Learning And Cybernetics, pp. 1072-1075. , Dalian, China, 13-16 August; Shi, H.B., Huang, H.K., Wang, Z.H., The Stability of a Restricted Bayesian Network: An Empirical Investigation (2003) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pp. 345-349. , Xian, China, 2-5 November; Shi, H.B., Wang, Z.H., Huang, H.K., Li-Ping, J., Text Classification Based on the TAN Model (2002) IEEEProceeding TENCON'02; Wang, H., Qiu, D., Computing with Words via Turing Machines: A Formal Approach (2003) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 11 (6); Halliday, M.A.K., Fuzzy Grammatics: A Systemic Functional Approach to Fuzziness in Natural Language (1995) The International Joint Conference of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and the Second International Fuzzy Engineering Symposium, pp. 9-26. , Yokohama Japan, March 20 - 24; Zadeh, L.A., The Concept of a Generalized Constraint-ABridgefrom Natural Languages to Mathematics (2005) NAFIPS 2005 - Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society; Yages, R.R., On The Retranslation Process In Zadeh's Paradigm Of Computing With Words (2004) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part B: Cybernetics, 34 (2), pp. 1184-1195; Glockner, I., Knoll, A., Fuzzy Quantifiers: A Natural Language Technique for Data Fusion (2001) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion 2001), , Montreal QC, Canada, August 7-10; Zadeh, L.A., A Computational Approach to Fuzzy Quantifiers in Natural Languages (1983) Comp.

Very often we will see one claiming that the technology and the protocol processing accelerated via some hardware means. This is especially true especially in today's world there are multi-cores processing power and hardware acceleration is achievable. These are via hardware and processor. There can be an alternative solution via software techniques as well. We can program the software to intelligently view into the protocol processing such as at routing packets or switching the mode of processing via a preprogrammed filter. We can utilize of the software triggers and apply especially in the NEMO handover process, as an example. Via the intelligent software processing method, many more other sub-components of NEMO can also be achievable, such as PKI-CA concept.

The Fractal based zero-knowledge protocol was possible because of the intrinsic connection between the Mandelbrot and Julia Fractal sets. In the proposed protocol, the private key was used as an input parameter for Mandelbrot Fractal function to generate the corresponding public key. Julia Fractal function was then used to calculate the verified value based on the existing private key and the received public key. The proposed protocol was designed to be resistant against attacks. Fractal based zero-knowledge protocol was an attractive alternative to the traditional number theory zero-knowledge protocol. © 2008 Science Publications.",Cryptography; Fractal; Mandelbrot fractal set and julia fractal set; Zero-knowledge,,,,,,,"Adelsbach, A., Sadeghi, A., Zero-knowledge watermark detection and proof of ownership (2001) LNCS, 2137, pp. 273-288. , Information Hiding: Fourth International Workshop, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Germany, April 25-27; Goldwasser, S., S.

The design of DSP-128 is divided into three stages: Initialization Stage, Keystream Generation Stage, and Encryption Stage. The design goal of DSP-128 is to come up with a secure stream cipher with good performance for data encryption. The experimental results show that the encryption rate of DSP-128 is one time slower (running on single processor) than the widely adapted stream cipher RC4, with a higher level of security against possible cryptanalysis attacks. However, because of its multithreaded nature, DSP-128 can take the speed up advantage of multi-core processor architectures which are available widely. © 2008 Science Publications.",Cryptography; Discrete logarithm problem; Multithreading; Polynomial; Stream cipher,,,,,,,"Afzal, M., Kausar, F., Masood, A., Comparative Analysis of the Structures of eSTREAM Submitted Stream Ciphers (2006) Proceeding of International Conference on Emerging Technologies ICET '06, pp. 245-250; Odlyzko, A., Discrete Logarithms in Finite Fields and their Crytographic Significance (1984) Advances in Cryptology - Eurocrypt '84, pp. 224-314. , Springer, Verlag, pp; Diffie, W., Hellman, M., New Directions in Cryptography (1976) IEEE Trans.

The concept of NEMO, is actually building on top of the MIPv6 and using MIPv6 as its backbone. The differences are much align at the capability of the Router being able to roam freely, hence the term Mobile Router (MR). Whereas in the MIPv6 world, there is only fix Access Router (AR). Since the NEMO is directly associated with MIPv6 as the backbones building blocks, the NEMO concepts has also inherits the security management systems of which MIPv6 is adapting. As the matter of fact, the NEMO concept has exposed greater security risks with the use of IPSec as the security design. Coupled with nested looping concept and capability that NEMO offered, the use of IPSec as the security design will no longer be sufficient from the efficiency point of view. In this paper, we will illustrate the use of IPSec on NEMO, and zooming into the instances whereby nested looping comes into picture and how security system will be at risk and finally proposing a new security design system to counter the inefficiencies. ©2007 IEEE.",Mobile internet protocol version 6 (MIPv6); Mobile network notes (MNN); Mobile router (MR); Network mobility (NEMO),Industrial management; Routers; Access router; Building Blocks; International conferences; Malaysia; Mobile internet protocol version 6 (MIPv6); Mobile network notes (MNN); Mobile Router; Mobile router (MR); Network mobility; Network mobility (NEMO); Security design; Security management; Security management systems; Security risks; Telecommunication systems,,,,,,"Johnson, D., Perkins, C., Arkko, J., (2004) Mobility Support in IPv6, , IETF RFC3775, June; Devarapalli, V., Wakikawa, R., Petrescu, A., Thubert, P., (2005) Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol, , IETF RFC3963.

In addition, distributed hierarchical IDS model consists of two layers, cluster member layer and cluster head layer. Designing distributed hierarchical IDS is the main part of our methodology, where we try to show some improvement for ideal and accurate IDS for wireless ad hoc network.

In MIPv6 technology, the Access Router (AR) plays important roles such as provide sessions connectivity and safe-guarding communications protocol. Whereas in NEMO, the routers in the communication chains are essentially the moving targets and hence the Mobile Router (MR). The MR too, inherits the basic functionalities of AR. In the basic MIPv6 and NEMO modus operandi, when the Mobile Network Notes (MNN) roamed away from home link and attached to some other foreign link, the MNNs are also addressable via a secondary address named as Care-of Address (CoA). The MNN essentially registered its primary CoA to the router on its own home link and thus registering the router to be its Home Agent (HA). These communication sets, and the ingredients of the communication will be managed via Binding Updates (BU) and the Binding Acknowledgement (BAck). Since the NEMO is using MIPv6 as the backbone, NEMO also inevitably inherits many design difficulties and problems that the MIPv6 seen. Such as using the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) with end-to-end tunneling and using nonce value within the BU to serve as part of the authentication process and many more. In this paper, we illustrate the scenario of authentication problems involving NEMO movements and the flaw in security design. With the aim of succeeding IPSec we then propose a much better solution which is the use of Random Number, coupled with PKI concept. ©2007 IEEE.",Acknowledgement (BAck); Binding updates (BU); Care-of address (CoA); Home agent (HA); Mobile network notes (MNN); Mobile router (MR); Network mobility (NEMO),Access control; Argon; Authentication; Breeder reactors; Communication; Internet; Internet protocols; Laws and legislation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Routers; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Access router; Acknowledgement (BAck); Basic functionalities; Binding updates; Binding updates (BU); Care-of address (CoA); Care-of-address; Communication chains; Home Agent; Home agent (HA); International conferences; Internet protocol-security; Malaysia; Mobile internet protocol version 6; Mobile network notes (MNN); Mobile networks; Mobile Router; Mobile router (MR); Moving targets; Network mobility; Network mobility (NEMO); Random numbers; Security design; Technology,,,,,,"Johnson, D., Perkins, C., Arkko, J., (2004) Mobility Support in IPv6, , IETF RFC3775, June; Devarapalli, V., Wakikawa, R., Petrescu, A., Thubert, P., (2005) Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol, , IETF RFC3963.

In many cases, ECC had also been crafted onto specialized processor for performance reason. However, building a specialized ECC processor is not only time consuming but also costly. Therefore, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, the software approach of ECC in a multiprocessing environment is indeed more attractive, especially with the recent development in multi-core processors. The main objective of this research is therefore to implement identified parallel mathematical algorithms in multi-threading environment to support the development of ECC in software.

Having fractal based digital signature scheme is possible due to the strong connection between the Mandelbrot and Julia fractal sets. The link between the two fractal sets used for the conversion of the private key to the public key. Mandelbrot fractal function takes the chosen private key as the input parameter and generates the corresponding public-key. Julia fractal function then used to sign the message with receiver's public key and verify the received message based on the receiver's private key. The propose scheme was resistant against attacks, utilizes small key size and performs comparatively faster than the existing DSA, RSA digital signature scheme. Fractal digital signature scheme was an attractive alternative to the traditional number theory digital signature scheme. © 2007 Science Publications.",And Julia fractal set; Digital signature scheme; Fractals cryptography; Mandelbrot fractal set,,,,,,,"Branovic, I., Giorgi, R., Martinelli, E., Memory Performance of Public-Key Cryptography Methods in Mobile Environments (2003) ACM SIGARC Workshop on Memory performance: Dealing with Applications, Systems and Architecture (MEDEA-03), 1, pp. 24-31. , New Orleans, LA, USA; Alfred J.

This research will examine the effects of weakly chosen password-keys on the security of block ciphers. A new hybrid optimization heuristic cryptanalytic attack (Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm) is used to conduct an intelligent key-search attack on classical ciphers and modern ciphers. The algorithm chosen to represent modern block ciphers is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES is an algebraic product cipher which combines elements of substitution and transposition, Therefore, the primarily aims of this paper is to study the effects of an optimization heuristic cryptanalytic attack on block cipher. © 2005 IEEE.",Cryptanalysis; Cryptographic ciphers; Heuristic search,Algebra; Algorithms; Cryptography; Optimization; Security of data; Cryptanalysis; Cryptographic ciphers; Heuristic search; Heuristic methods,,,,,,"Gründlingh, W.R., Van Vuuren, J.H., Using genetic Algorithms to Break a Simple Cryptographic Cipher, , http://www.apprendre-en- ligne.net/bibliotheque/genetic.ps; Schneier, B., (1996) Applied Cryptography- Protocols, Algorithms, and Scarce Code in C, , Second Edition.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and sift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic. © 2005 IEEE.",Alert correlation; Data quality; Intrusion detection; Security,Algorithms; Computational methods; Computer system firewalls; Reliability; Routers; Alert correlation; Data quality; Intrusion detection; Security of data,,,,,,"(2005), http://www.arcsight.com/product.htm, Arcsight Enterprise Security Management, Product Information, 27 July; Feinstein, B., Matthews, G., White, J., The Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP) (2005) IETF IDWG, , http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/ draft-ietf-idwg-beepidxp07.txt, 27 July; CERT/CC Advisories, http://www.cert.org/advisories/ (27 July 2005); Kruegel, C., Robertson, W., Alert Verification - Determining the Success of Intrusion Attempts Proc.

The aim of Penetration testing is to identify exploits and vulnerabilities that exists within an organization's informational technology (IT) infrastructure. Penetration testing helps to identify the information that is exposed to the internet world. The penetration testing is done based on 'packet-kiddies' type attack, professional at work and disgruntled staff which is helpful to identify type of information available to the attacker and whether such information is hazardous or not.",,Cryptography; Information analysis; Information technology; Internet; Professional aspects; Scanning; Servers; Societies and institutions; Testing; Websites; Infrastructure; Network security; Penetration testing; Wireless network; Wireless telecommunication systems,,,,,,"Midian, P., (2004) An Insight White Paper Penetration Testing, , www.insight.co.uk, Insight Consulting, January 30; Johansson, K., (2001) Offensive Operations Model, , http://www.penetrationtest.com, KSAJ Inc, Version: 1.0 Public Release, Posted: August 7; Abreu, E., (2001) No Budget?

All of them are developed as ciphers' extension or enhancement tool to gain better security or additional features. NITS had defined 5 modes as the standards; they are ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR mode. Among these modes, the CTR mode is the one that capable to be fully parallelized and possess more security features. However the disadvantage in the implementation of CTR mode is the deviation of the counter value between the encryptor and decryptor. The synchronization of the counter value can be easily lost during delivery or transmission, hence affecting the integrity of the system. This paper proposed a method to eliminate the synchronization issue by calculating the initial counter value from the initial value. The new counter value is calculated using an algorithm comprises of the cipher algorithm and a hash algorithm. This new method introduce minimum overhead at the beginning of each encryption or decryption process. By using the enhanced version of CTR mode, the implementation has become simplified, while maintaining its attractive features of better security and its ability of parallel processing. © 2003 IEEE.",Authentication; Communication channels; Communications technology; Computer science; Counting circuits; Cryptography; Information security; NIST; Parallel processing; Trade agreements,Algorithms; Authentication; Communication channels (information theory); Computer science; Counting circuits; Hash functions; Security of data; Cipher algorithms; Communications technology; Decryption process; Modes of operation; NIST; Parallel processing; Security features; Trade agreements; Cryptography,,,,,,"National Bureau Of Standards, DES Modes of Operation (1980) Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS-81.

Bhd, KLCC Tower 2, Level 23, Kuala Lumpur, 50088, Malaysia","The presumption of player distrust and untrustworthiness in mental card gaming results in the formulation of complex and compute-intensive protocols, particularly for shuffling. We present a robust, verifiable and efficient card shuffling protocol based on an optimisation of Chang-Melham arbitrary-sized (AS) Benes permutation network (PN), which can flexibly accommodates variable pack sizes, achieving optimal shuffling performance. We also outline the use of these PNs in a distributed (among η players) construction, which combines the best attributes of Abe and Jakobsson-Juels mix-net formalisms. Card shuffling can therefore be executed on a structurally simple mix-net – with only t + 1 PNs required for operational robustness against collusion by t cheating players, and efficient zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) to verify correct shuffling by each player. Shuffling efficiency is also enhanced by our limited application of verifiable secret sharing (VSS) on the ElGamal keys. The resultant protocol achieves an asymptotic complexity of O(tN lg N) for N inputs; which is comparable or superior to previous schemes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",Benes permutation network; Mental card game; Mix-net; Shuffle,Security of data; Asymptotic complexity; Card games; Mix-net; Optimisations; Permutation network; Shuffle; Verifiable secret sharing; Zero knowledge proof; Complex networks,,,,,,"Crépeau, C., A Secure Poker Protocol that Minimizes the Effect of Player Coalitions Crypto, 85, pp. 73-86; Crépeau, C., A zero-knowledge poker protocol that achieves confidentiality of the players’ strategy or How to achieve an electronic poker face Crypto, 86, pp. 239-247; Schindelhauer, C., (1998), http://www.tcs.mu-luebeck.de/Forschung/A9814.ps, A Toolbox for Mental Card Games.

One of the most challenging aspects in such system is to have a VOD server with a capability of retrieving and transmitting different blocks of videos simultaneously. A part from this the VOD server should also capable of producing high number of simultaneous streams with a low average waiting time. In this paper we present a new data storage scheme employed by the VOD server to eliminate latency and hence producing maximum number of simultaneous streams. In this scheme the disk is divided into regions and blocks of video are scattered within the regions based on the residual theory rule. We also developed a stream caching technique for reducing the average waiting time of the system. © 2002 IEEE.,,Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Software engineering; Average waiting-time; Caching technique; Data storage; Video on demands (VoD); Video-on-demand servers; VOD servers; Video on demand,,,,,304/PKOMP/633114,"Chang, E., Garcia-Molina, H., Reducing Initial Latency in Media Servers (1997) IEEE Multimedia, pp. 50-61. , Vol; Chang, C.K., Shih, C.-C., A circular skip-cluster scheme to support video-on-demand services.
