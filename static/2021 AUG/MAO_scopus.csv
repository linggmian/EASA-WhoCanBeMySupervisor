Nowadays, many organisations aim to make these resources available to users. Basically, Dirichlet smoothing (DS) model is widely used to retrieve DRO documents. DS model uses a smoothing parameter μ which plays a strong role in finding the value of the unseen terms to avoid zero probability value. For documents of equal length, the value of μ is set as a constant value although its value depends on the length of a document. In DROs, almost all documents are of different length, and each metadata unit in a document also has a different length. Hence, it is not appropriate to predefine the μ parameter with a constant value and uses it for different search space. This leads to difficulty in accessing and retrieving the DRO documents. To solve fixed smoothing-parameter value problem in DRO’s retrieval, and make DROs more accessible, Adaptive Dirichlet Smoothing (ADS) and Adaptive Structured Dirichlet Smoothing (ASDS) models are proposed to improve the performance of the DRO’s retrieval by estimating the smoothing parameter automatically. The proposed ASDS model comprises the ADS model together with an existing DS model. Experimental results on CHiC2013 collections show that the proposed models have the ability to retrieve the most relevant results (documents or metadata units) related to a particular query and reduce the zero-probability values compared with state-of-the-art traditional methods particularly on DROs. Moreover, t-test result is used to prove that the performance of the proposed models is statistically significant. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Digital resource objects; Dirichlet smoothing model; Retrieval model,Multimedia systems; Constant values; Digital resources; Dirichlet; Model use; Search spaces; Smoothing parameter; State of the art; Value problems; Metadata,,,,,,,"Abdulmutalib, N., Fuhr, N., Language models and smoothing methods for collections with large variation in document length (2008) 2008 19Th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 9-14. , IEEE; Alma’Aitah, W.Z., Talib, A.Z., Osman, M.A., Document expansion method for digital resource objects (2019) In 2019 IEEE Jordan International Joint Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (JEEIT), pp. 256-260; Alma’aitah, W.Z., Talib, A.Z., Osman, M.A., Opportunities and challenges in enhancing access to metadata of cultural heritage collections: a survey (2020) Artif Intell Rev, 53 (5), pp. 3621-3646; Alma'aitah, W.Z., Zawawi Talib, A., Osman, M., Information retrieval framework for digital resource objects (2019) International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering, 8 (1), p. 6; Alma'aitah, W.Z., Zawawi Talib, A., Osman, M., Structured Dirichlet smoothing model for digital resource objects (2019) International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, 9 (1), p. 4; Almasri, M., Semantic query structuring to enhance precision of an information retrieval system: Application to the medical domain (2013) CORIA, pp. 293-298; Almasri, M., Tan, K., Berrut, C., Chevallet, J.-P., Mulhem, P., Integrating semantic term relations into information retrieval systems based on language models (2014) Asia Information Retrieval Symposium, pp. 136-147. , Springer; Alnaied, A., Elbendak, M., Bulbul, A., An intelligent use of stemmer and morphology analysis for Arabic information retrieval (2020) Egyptian Informatics Journal; Arslan, A., On the usefulness of html meta elements for web retrieval (2020) Anadolu University of Sciences & Technology-A: Applied Sciences & Engineering, 21 (1); Azzopardi, L., Losada, D.E., Fairly retrieving documents of all lengths (2007) In proceedings of the first international conference in theory of information retrieval (ICTIR 2007), pp. 65-76; Berger, A., Lafferty, J., Information retrieval as statistical translation (1999) Proceedings of the 22Nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 222-229. , .

Computer-aided SLI diagnosis has been proposed to counter these inconveniences. This study focuses on evaluating the feasibility of computer systems used to diagnose SLI. Methods: The accuracy of Webgazer.js for software-based gaze tracking is tested under different lighting conditions. Predefined time delays of a prototype diagnosis task automation script are contrasted against with manual delays based on human time estimation to understand how automation influences diagnosis accuracy. SLI diagnosis binary classifier was built and tested based on randomised parameters. The obtained results were cross-compared to Singlims_ES.exe for equality. Results: Webgazer.js achieved an average accuracy of 88.755% under global lighting conditions, 61.379% under low lighting conditions and 52.7% under face-focused lighting conditions. The diagnosis task automation script found to execute with actual time delays with a deviation percentage no more than 0.04%, while manually executing time delays based on human time estimation resulted in a deviation percentage of not more than 3.37%. One-tailed test probability value produced by both the newly built classifier and Singlims_ES were observed to be similar up to three decimal places. Conclusion: The results obtained should serve as a foundation for further evaluation of computer tools to help speech language pathologists diagnose SLI. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.",Automation; Diagnosis; Specific language impairment,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This study was supported by the short-term grant (304/PHUMANITI/6315349) from Universiti Sains Malaysia.,"(2017) Specific language impairment [Internet], , https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/specific-language-impairment, National Institutes of Health.

In attempting to enhance the accessibility of these resources, it is necessary to cater the needs of the users as well as provide search outcomes which are closer to the request. Recently, researchers converted the search path in DRO search from the data retrieval (DR) approach to the information retrieval (IR) approach. Various DRO retrieval systems have been built to facilitate the process of accessing the DRO contents. Thus, such systems need to evaluate their performance effectivity. This paper presents the characteristics of the collections that should be made available in the DRO test collections. It also reviews the computational evaluations and statistical tests used to evaluate the performance of the DRO retrievals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital resource objects; Evaluations; Statistical tests; Test collections,Industrial engineering; Computational evaluation; Data retrieval; Digital resources; Rapid growth; Retrieval systems; Test Collection; Engineering,,,,,,,"Witten, I.H., Bainbridge, D., Paynter, G., Boddie, S., (2002) Importing Documents and Metadata into Digital Libraries: Requirements Analysis and an Extensible Architecture, pp. 390-405. , In: Agosti, M., Thanos, C.

The importance of deep learning lies in the localisation and classification of an object based on frames. This study focuses on fish recognition methods in underwater videos and addresses the underlying challenges of these methods. It is important to develop effective methods to recognise fish and their movements using underwater videos. From a practical and scientific perspective, this is extremely useful to automatically recognise fish through their movement and to monitor and collect biomass in marine bodies. More importantly, it allows researchers to collect and analyse information related to the health and well-being of the Marine ecosystem. As most of the current methods work on static images, the issue arises when these methods are applied to images from videos. The existing multiple fish detection methods for underwater videos have a low detection rate due to the inherent underwater conditions such as the presence of coral reefs and other challenges which include the different sizes, shapes, colour, and speed of fish as well as marine behaviours such as the overlapping of fish. Therefore, the use of improved methods based on the latest deep learning algorithms has been proposed for multiple fish detection. This paper provides a novel framework for fish instance segmentation in underwater videos. The proposed model for improved recognition methods is composed of four main stages: 1) pre-processing method to reduce external factors in the videos for better detection and recognition of fish in underwater videos, 2) use of deep learning approach for enhanced detection of fish using RESENT, 3) enhanced detection of multiple fish based on the Region Proposal Network (RPN) architecture, and 4) use of a dynamic instance segmentation method. The results of this study indicate that the proposed framework has a better performance capability than other state-of-the-art models for multi-fish instance segmentation. © 2020",Deep learning; Fish detection; Instance segmentation,automation; biomass; breakthrough curve; coral reef; machine learning; recognition; segmentation; underwater vehicle; videography; Anthozoa,,,,,,,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Devin, M., Tensorflow: large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems (2016) arXiv, , preprint arXiv:1603.04467; Aljarrah, I.A., Ghorab, A.S., Khater, I.M., Object recognition system using template matching based on signature and principal component analysis (2012) Int.

Different metadata standards exist for describing various types of digital objects. Several researches have reported on how to address issues related to accessing of metadata resources. Most studies on metadata involve cultural heritage domain, and this is an indication of the importance of this domain in metadata research and development. Research on metadata in cultural heritage mainly revolves around three fundamental issues: (1) lack of quality in metadata contents in most of the cases, (2) difficulty in accessing metadata contents due largely to limited user’s knowledge on the content of the metadata, and (3) heterogeneity of the data at the level of schemas which makes the access even more difficult. The lack of quality in metadata makes it difficult for the users to retrieve and explore information that satisfies their needs. So, in order to make its contents more accessible, enhancing the metadata content is required, especially for cultural heritage collections which consist of digital objects (structured documents) described by a variety of metadata schemas. This paper presents issues and challenges in enhancing access to metadata by reviewing the existing approaches in metadata environment with a particular emphasis on cultural heritage collections. In this paper, firstly, we look at the classification of metadata which is divided into two categories namely data retrieval and information retrieval. Then, we present the analysis, findings and suggestions on how to address issues in enhancing access to metadata contents especially in cultural heritage collections. A detailed comparison is given between information retrieval and data retrieval, and it focuses on the applicability of one approach over the other. A framework that aims to improve the effectiveness of retrieval when searching metadata is also proposed and tested. The proposed framework consists of approaches and methods that are expected to enhance access to metadata especially in cultural heritage collections and be useful for those with limited knowledge on cultural heritage. The experiments were conducted on CHiC2013 which is a collection on cultural heritage.

People travel for business, study, vacation, religious activity and many more. Nonetheless, while travelling, their safety and health condition can be a major concern to travelers as well as concern from their family members. There exists many existing smart traveler app for the purpose of locating a traveler. However, they might produce accurate location. Predicting location in all apps is largely based on the speed of a walking traveler. This paper discusses the techniques for more accurate location tracking and location prediction of a traveler. The techniques are able to track the movement of the traveler using location tracking techniques and predict the location of a missing traveler based on parameters such as walking speed, age, gender, weather condition and the health condition. The results based on an app developed in this research show that the techniques are more accurate and efficient. Also, with these techniques, a better emergency alert system can be incorporated in a smart traveler app. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Smart traveler app,Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Tracking (position); Accurate location; Emergency alert system; Health condition; Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Safety and healths; Tracking techniques; Location,,,,,,,"Reidenberg, J.R., Gellman, R., Debelak, J., Elewa, A., Liu, N., (2013) Privacy and Missing Persons after Natural Disasters, p. 128. , Washington, DC and New York, NY: Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham Law School and Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, p; (2016) Munich Attack: Teenage Gunman Kills Nine People at Shopping Centre, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/22/munich-shopping-centre-evacuated-after-reported-shooting-germany, Accessed 22 Sept 2016; (2015) Hajj Pilgrimage: More than 700 Dead in Crush near Mecca, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/mecca-crush-during-hajj-kills-at-least-100-saudi-state-tv, Accessed 22 Sept 2016; (2016) Louisiana Faces Ongoing Flood Danger as Obama Declares Federal Disaster Zone, , https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-disaster-obama-baton-rouge-mississippi, Accessed 23 Sept 2016; Wang, S., Min, J., Yi, B.K., Location based services for mobiles: Technologies and standards (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC 2008), pp. 35-38. , pp; Steiniger, S., Neun, M., Edwardes, A., (2006) Foundations of Location Based Services-Lecture Notes, , https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b56b/f42dd39a383c07e5eeb01498309e6e52b8af, Zurich: Department of Geography, University of Zurich; Zahradnik, F., (2016) Wi-Fi Positioning System, , https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-positioning-system-1683343, Accessed 20 Oct 2016; Fitzpatrick, K., Brewer, M.A., Turner, S., Another look at pedestrian walking speed (2006) Transp.

In order to increase the retrieval effectiveness of DRO, adding extra information to its contents is required. However, the extra information must be related to the structure of DRO. Each document contains metadata units with multiple topics. Document expansion (DE) methods utilize the unstructured documents to increase the document contents. In the same way, in this paper, an Enhanced Document Expansion (EDE) method is proposed by utilizing structured documents. DE method is a way of feeding and providing documents with new information to increase the effectiveness of the documents. Usually, traditional DE methods add terms to the original documents. In the proposed EDE method, a new procedure to increase the information content according to specific steps is added and aimed at adding new information which is more relevant and closer to each metadata unit in each document. The proposed EDE method calculates the nearest sentences to the content of the metadata unit by improving the probability estimation equation. The experiments which are conducted on cultural heritage CHiC2013 collections show a statistically significant improvement over the traditional document expansion methods. © 2019 IEEE.",Digital resource objects; Document expansion; Information retrieval,Electrical engineering; Information retrieval; Mathematical techniques; Cultural heritages; Digital resources; Document expansions; Information contents; Probability estimation; Retrieval effectiveness; Structured document; Unstructured documents; Metadata,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM",ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Universiti Sains Malaysia for this research under the Research University Grant entitled “A Two-Stage Expansion Method for Retrieval of Metadata Content in Cultural Heritage Collection ”.,"Fukumoto, J., Aburai, N., Yamanishi, R., Interactive document expansion for answer extraction of question answering system (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 22, pp. 991-1000; Wang, J., Oard, D.W., CLEF-2005 Cl-sr at Maryland: Document and Query Expansion Using Side Collections and Thesauri, pp. 800-809; Agirre, E., Arregi, X., Otegi, A., Document Expansion Based on WordNet for Robust IR, pp. 9-17; Singhal, A., Pereira, F., Document Expansion for Speech Retrieval, pp. 34-41; Johnson, S.E., Woodland, P.C., Jones, K.S., Jourlin, P., Spoken Document Retrieval for TREC-8 at Cambridge University, p. 31; Darwish, K., Oard, D.W., Adapting morphology for Arabic information retrieval (2007) Arabic Computational Morphology, pp. 245-262. , Springer; Craswell, N., Hawking, D., Robertson, S., Effective Site Finding Using Link Anchor Information, pp. 250-257; Naidu, R., Bharti, S.K., Babu, K.S., Mohapatra, R.K., Text summarization with automatic keyword extraction in telugu e-newspapers (2018) Smart Computing and Informatics, pp. 555-564. , Springer; Teixeira, L., Lopes, G., Ribeiro, R.A., Automatic Extraction of Document Topics, pp. 101-108; Shirakawa, M., Hara, T., Nishio, S., N-gram Idf: A Global Term Weighting Scheme Based on Information Distance, pp. 960-970; He, T., Li, L., Qu, G., Zhang, Y., (2007) Chinese Information Retrieval Based on Document Expansion; Min, J., Leveling, J., Zhou, D., Jones, G.J.F., Document expansion for image retrieval (2010) Adaptivity, pp. 65-71. , Personalization and Fusion of Heterogeneous Information, Paris, France; Akasereh, M., A quantitative evaluation of query expansion in domain specific information retrieval (2013) Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 50 (1), pp. 1-7; Johnson, S., Jourlin, P., Jones, K.S., Woodland, P., Spoken document retrieval for TREC-7 at Cambridge university (1999) To Appear in Proc.

These lead to decrease in the performance of the DRO retrieval. With a view to increase the performance of the DRO retrieval, many components of information retrieval have been enhanced such as document expansion (DE), retrieval model such as Dirichlet smoothing (DS) model, and query expansion (QE). Most of these studies have shown that employing IR components (DE, QE or DS) independently to enhance the DROs retrieval has helped to increase the performance of the retrieval. It is assumed that IR components can enhance the performance of the DRO retrieval. Based on this assumption, an information retrieval framework (IRF) for DROs is presented in this paper. The proposed IRF is to address the retrieval problems in DROs and provide an environment for retrieving information from DROs with the highest possible performance. The principle task of IRF is to make all components of IR (DE, DS, and QE) work together to achieve the greatest benefit in improving the retrieval performance. Several experiments were conducted on CHiC2013 which is a collection on cultural heritage. The results show a considerable enhancement over other IR approaches that use the DE method, DS model and QE method independently. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This paper presents a mobile-based method for mangrove species identification called multi-layer mangrove species identification method (MSIA) and its application for Kilim Geo-forest Park, in Langkawi, Malaysia. This work involves formulating the identification method, the design and development of the mobile application, and its integration with the Mangrove Reference Data Centre. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to support visitors with limited knowledge on the mangrove tree species. One of the main features of MSIA is the automatic identification of the mangrove tree species based on its leaf which enhances the performance of species identification. Firstly, the mangrove tree leaf is captured using the mobile phone camera. Next, the first layer in the identification method is carried out to identify the leaf shape. Once the species has been identified, additional parameters such as types of tree root, tree bark, flower or fruit will be entered in the second layer of the identification process. A specific mangrove species common name and its related information such as biological information and possible medicinal or commercial worth of the species will then be displayed. This paper presents the design and implementation of MSIA as well as the testing and the evaluation of the method and its application. It is believed that MSIA would make a visit to the mangrove park more meaningful and enjoying to the visitors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Mangrove species; Multi-Layer identification,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image processing; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Plants (botany); Automatic identification; Biological information; Design and Development; Design and implementations; Identification process; Mangrove species; Species identification; User friendly interface; Forestry,,,,,,,"(2009) Langkawi Mangrove Biodiversity Database, , http://www.mangrove.my/page.php?; Kumar, N., Belhumeur, P.N., Biswas, A., Jacobs, D.W., Kress, W.J., Lopez, I.C., Soares, J.V.B., Leafsnap: A computer vision system for automatic plant species identification (2012) ECCV 2012, Part II.

It provides numerous kinds of ecosystem services that are of great benefit to humankind. However, to the general public, knowledge on the importance of mangrove ecosystems is very limited. In this paper, we present our experience in establishing the Mangrove Reference Data Center (MRDC) and its augmented reality-based mobile application called Kilim Scouter which provides information details of mangrove plants and related information to the users. MRDC is a data center that stores information details of mangrove plants in Kilim Geoforest Park in Langkawi Island, Malaysia such as common and scientific names of species, as well as its distribution (GPS location). In addition, MRDC also stores other information for example other inhabitants of the ecosystem and non-living entities such as Karstic hills and caves found in the Mangrove ecosystem. MRDC comes with a web application that acts as an interface to MRDC for accessing, adding or modifying the information details of mangrove plants. Kilim Scouter is a mobile application which deploys Augmented Reality (AR) technology, a technology through which the view of the real world environment is augmented by adding computer-generated elements/objects. Kilim Scouter utilizes the AR technology to automatically track and identify the mangrove plants and its related information, and then provides the information by retrieving data from MRDC. MRDC and Kilim Scouter are capable of providing on-the-go accessibility of information details of mangrove plants and target users such as tourists and researchers. This application will create awareness on the importance of the mangrove ecosystems and thus, assist the effort in sustaining the mangrove ecosystem. © 2018 Authors.",Augmented reality; Data centre; Mangroves,,,,,,,,"http://www.wwf.org.my/about_wwf/what_we_do/forests_main/the_malaysian_rainforest/types_of_forests/mangrove_forests/, [Accessed 21 December 2015]; Zhang, D., Lan, Z., Wang, Q., Wang, X., Zhang, W., Li, Z., The evaluation of the mangrove ecosystem services value change in Zhangjiang River estuary based on remote sensing (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), Barcelona, 1 (12), pp. 2302-2305; Rabbi, I., Ullah, S., A Survey on augmented reality challenges and tracking (2013) Acta Graphica, 24 (1-2), pp. 29-46; (2011) Malaysia Mangrove, Malaysia Mangrove, , http://www.ukm.my/mangrove/, [Accessed 2015 December 21]; (2014) ""Mangroves and Their World,"", , http://www.mangrove.or.jp/mangrove/, ISME.

Part of the errors is due to mistakes in the medical record or incomplete medical record which may trigger tragic consequences. In this paper, we present an application that manages securely personal health information on a mobile platform and keeps all the medical records of a patient in digital format. Patients are able to access their medical record at their convenience and the confidentiality of information is guaranteed. Patients are also able to share their personal health record with their respective doctor in a secure way. The application consists of several modules: incognito, access control, privacy control, authentication, encryption, multifactor authentication and emergency control. An anonymous database is created by removing all the identifier of a patient before the health record is stored in the database. This provides an extra layer of protection to the patient’s privacy. In particular, our proposed application introduces the multifactor authentication and emergency control modules which provides a multi-layered defense authentication and emergency case handler respectively. Thus, the proposed application allows the patient to assess their records conveniently and securely, and helps them in emergency situations. As such, the application is suitable for cases involving large number of patients and emergency situations such as in Hajj healthcare management. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Access control; Cryptography; Health; Medical problems; Public health; Emergency control; Emergency situation; Health-care managements; Mobile platform; Multi-factor authentication; Personal health informations; Personal health record; Privacy control; Authentication,,,,,,"We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia and the support of the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS), 203.PTS.6728004 from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education.","Alwan, A., (2010) Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases, , World Health Organization, Switzerland; (2010) World Confederation for Physical Therapy, , http://www.wcpt.org/node/33001, January; Gaffar, H.D., Achmadi, U.F., Syamsu, I.P., Hajj health management focussing on the risk factor management (2013) Int.

However, the need for such systems goes further than just the need to convert a scanned document into a text file. There is also a need to produce a more appealing and refine reconstructed fonts. Recently, many research works in font reconstruction have shown successful and encouraging results. However, the usual way of evaluating the performance of font reconstruction is through visual inspection which is very subjective in nature, and arduous for a more perfect and objective evaluation. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a framework for an objective performance evaluation method that can be used to compare a reconstructed font with its original counterpart. Thus, it will involve studying the nature of the current and existing digital fonts and then formulate a method to compare character glyph of the created font with its corresponding original font. From this framework, it is expected that font reconstruction would be made more refine and the evaluation can be made more objective and less arduous than using the human eye, and old and rare documents can be more readily available for users in digital format with better precision in particular on tablets and other resource-constrained devices. © 2016 IEEE.",character classification; digital font reconstruction; optical character recognition,Character recognition; Optical character recognition; Character classification; Digital format; Human eye; Objective evaluation; Optical character recognition (OCR); Resourceconstrained devices; Text file; Visual inspection; Digital devices,,,,,,,"Cutter, M.P., Van Beusekom, J., Shafait, F., Breuel, T.M., Unsupervised font reconstruction based on token co-occurrence (2010) Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering DocEng'10, pp. 143-150. , (New York, NY, USA), ACM; Cutter, M.P., Van Beusekom, J., Shafait, F., Breuel, T.M., Font group identification using reconstructed fonts (2011) DRR of SPIE Proceedings, SPIE, 7874, pp. 1-10. , (G.

The patients inflicted with these two critical impairments are devoid of the ability to carry out their basic needs. In many countries, siblings or relatives are normally the group of people who provide the caregiving for home-based patients whereas in day-care centers and hospitals, nurses are the ones who are responsible to provide caregiving to them. However, caregiving process can be stressful and exhausting especially when other siblings or responsible caregivers could not provide the essential support. In this paper, we present an assistive solution for severe speech and motion impairment people called WeCare. WeCare presents an idea that allows such patients to communicate using Leap Motion. Leap Motion is a new technology that can detect hand motion at high precision and thus it can be used to allow people with motion and speech impairments to put minimum effort in conveying messages. Besides, WeCare features a smart speech synthesis and menu customization as well as tracking and recording of medical history in order to provide a complete support in terms of personal care for the people with disabilities by tracking their meal, body temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure and required medicine wherever necessary. Moreover, this cloud based mobile application also provides social interaction and caregiving coordination which enhances caregiving experience and creates a livelier environment for the patients and caregivers. Patients can interact with their social group (caregivers, other patients and friends) through some interactive functions embedded in WeCare such as messaging and interactive drawing board. © Research India Publications.",Assistive solution; Caregiving coordination; Motion sensor; Smart healthcare,,,,,,,,"N ESCAP Disability at a Glance, , http://www.unescap.org/sdd/publications/DG2012/SDDDisability-Glance-2012.pdf; RUN FOR NASAM - YES!

In this paper, the recognition of fish based on GCFD (Generalized Color Fourier Descriptor) is introduced. The features are extracted using the GCFD technique which represents the image in a frequency domain. By analyzing the frequencies, the non-related information (backgrounds, not required lines or borders) are identified by performing some spectrum changes on the frequencies. The required objects in this study are the fish. In other words, the frequencies corresponding to the fish are maintained while other frequencies are removed from the frequency domain. After removing the non-related frequencies, the frequency domain is inversed in order to obtain the required image for further image processing. GCFD is used as a descriptor to extract the features of the fish as it is invariant to rotation and translation. A cultured fish tank installed with high-end video cameras is required to record the video from side and top views. Koi fish are chosen due to their active swimming behavior, variety of colors and easy-to-adapt habitat in the water. The evaluation of the technique is based on Bhattacharyya Distance. Some improvements were obtained in the recognition rate using the GCFD compared with existing color descriptors. The improvement can lead to better classifications of objects. © 2015 IEEE.",Feature Extraction; Fourier Descriptor; Object Recognition,Color; Feature extraction; Fish; Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Object recognition; Video cameras; Bhattacharyya distance; Color descriptors; Descriptors; Fish tank; Fourier descriptors; Frequency domains; Swimming behavior; Top views; Image processing,,,,,,,"Wong, P.L., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Tracking multiple fish in a single tank using an improved particle filter (2013) Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 279, pp. 799-880; Wong, P.L., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Tracking multiple fish using colour changes identification and enhanced object tracking algorithm (2013) Applied Mechanics and Materials, 284-287, pp. 1528-1532. , January; Isard, M., Blake, A., Condensation-conditional density propagation for visual tracking (1998) International Journal of Computer Vision, 29 (1), pp. 5-28; Koller-Meier, E., Ade, F., Tracking multiple objects using the condensation algorithm (2001) Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 34, pp. 93-105. , February; Wong, P.L., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Modelling of fish swimming patterns using an enhanced object tracking algorithm (2011) 3CA 2011: 3rd International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA 2011), , Zhuhai, China; Ciocca, G., Cusano, C., Gasparini, F., Schettini, R., Self-adaptive image cropping for small displays (2007) Consumer Electronics, ICCE 2007.

The use of video cameras to capture motion images instead of static images poses a great challenge to researchers in terms of speed and accuracy of the object tracking and detection. In this paper, fish are used in the experiment due to its active swimming behaviour which emulates the movement of many living objects such as humans or animals. The main problem faced in the tracking process is that the fishes swim in various directions and angles. It is difficult to track and identify a specific fish in a school of fish in most cases. Besides, the fish may also appear to be overlapping one another. There exists several object tracking systems in the market but the focuses are mainly on surveillance. Besides, there is still room for improvement in the tracking process. Therefore, this paper focuses on using an additional camera for tracking fish in real-time environment. The evaluation of the tracking process consists of using the same video with an additional camera positioned above the fish tank. Results show improvement when an additional camera is used to obtain additional information mainly the trajectory patterns of the fish which contributes to bringing a higher accuracy of the tracking system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Dual camera; Fish tracking; Object tracking; Single camera,Cameras; Information science; Tracking (position); Video cameras; Dual cameras; Object Tracking; Real-time environment; Research domains; Single cameras; Swimming behaviours; Tracking process; Trajectory pattern; Fish,,,,,,,"Jia-Hong, L., Mei-Yi, W., Zhi-Cheng, G., A tank fish recognition and tracking system using computer vision techniques (2010) International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (ICCSIT), 4, pp. 528-532. , IEEE; Shao, L., Xie, G., Real-time tracking of moving objects on a water surface (2012) International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA), pp. 2114-2119. , IEEE; Chew, B.F., Eng, H.L., Thida, M., Vision-based real-time monitoring on the behavior of fish school (2009) IAPR Conference on Machine Vision Applications, pp. 90-93. , IEEE; Wong, P.L., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Modelling of fish swimming patterns using an enhanced object tracking algorithm (2012) Frontiers in Computer Education, 133, pp. 585-592. , In: Sambath, S., Zhu, E.

However, the tradition is becoming less and less popular nowadays due to the proliferation of new media entertainment. In this paper, we present the architecture of a software tool that allows people to experience shadow puppet play in the virtual world. Normally, a virtual puppet show is controlled automatically by the application. However, our tool allows the user to create storyline and control the puppets directly in real-time. This paper focuses in detail on the design and issues of two of the main components of an interactive virtual shadow puppet play which are the intelligent instructional tool for puppeteering and interactive virtual shadow puppet play animation. The result of the evaluation has shown that the tool is able to help users more beneficially and a higher degree of satisfaction among the respondents which include professional puppeteers and potential general users.

The associated heavier workloads together with tension and pressure often lead to stress-related health problems. People do really deserve a good rest when they come home from their office. As a result, the proposed solution-The Eye 2H is an intelligent system that will use the technique of image processing and face recognition to detect and analyze the human emotion to control the electronic equipment in their house through an intelligent control box. There are several studies highlighted that by controlling the brightness of light, we could affect the emotion or behavior of humans. Thus, we believe that The Eye 2H is capable to fulfill the main objective of the project which is to provide a better living environment for people in order to provide them a harmony and happy (2H) living life. The Eye 2H is capable of boosting the mood and emotion of the residents by controlling the electronic equipment in their house. The feature of turning on light automatically as well as fine-tune the brightness of light according to human emotion mood will give a 'welcoming home' effect to the house owner. Besides that, The Eye 2H is also a green technology project as it will support the Go Green concept by reducing the energy usage. © 2014 IEEE.",automated light control; lighting effects; smart lights; stress,Automation; Electronic equipment; Energy utilization; Houses; Image processing; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Luminance; Man machine systems; Oscillators (electronic); Stresses; Energy usage; Green technology; Human emotion; Increasing costs; Light control; Lighting effects; Living environment; Smart homes; Face recognition,,,,,,,"Ramos, H., Mustafa, M., Chin, M., The moderating effects of personality on work-family conflicts and stress among Malaysian working parents (2012) International Journal of Management Practice, 5 (3), pp. 225-244; Allen, T.D., Kiburz, K.M., Trait mindfulness and work-family balance among working parents: The mediating effects of vitality and sleep quality (2012) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 80 (2), pp. 372-379; (2011) Harris Interactive: 'Stress in the Workplace, , American Psychological Association; Miller, G.E., Chen, E., Parker, K.J., Psychological stress in childhood and susceptibility to the chronic diseases of aging: Moving toward a model of behavioral and biological mechanisms (2011) Psychological Bulletin, 137 (6), pp. 959-997; Sanders, M.R., Stallman, H.M.M., Workplace Triple P: A controlled evaluation of a parenting intervention for working parents.

Many methods have been used to track fishes by integrating microchips in fishes, using infra-red cameras, image processing and motion sensor. The use of particle filter in the process of tracking has been widely used by researchers. Particle filters is used to track people, fluid movement and animals. In this paper, the particle filter algorithm is improved to track multiple fish in a fish tank. The aim is to identify every fish trajectories and fish target location for further analysis. The main challenge is to ensure that the correct fish are tracked and the algorithm manages to identify specific fish even if they overlaps with each another. The objective of the study is to improve the existing particle filter to track multiple fish in a single fish tank. The improved algorithm contains an additional cache which stores the object's position to estimate the next potential move of the fish. The result is evaluated by comparing existing algorithm without the enhancement with the improved algorithm. Besides, suggestions in improving the particle filter will also be discussed in this paper. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",fish tracking; particle filter; tracking system,Algorithms; Computer science; Distributed computer systems; Image processing; Monte Carlo methods; Signal filtering and prediction; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Fluid movement; Improved particle filter; Infra-red cameras; Motion sensors; Particle filter; Particle filter algorithms; Target location; Tracking system; Fish,,,,,,,"Wong, P.L., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Modelling of fish swimming patterns using an enhanced object tracking algorithm (2012) Frontiers in Computer Education, pp. 585-592; Muizz, W.A., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Framework for modelling of fish behaviour through fish swimming patterns (2010) Ocean &Coastal Observation: Sensors and Systems (OCOSS 2010).

Different concepts have been taken such as installing water sensors and video cameras to identify movement speed, colours, shapes and swimming patterns displayed by the fishes. In this research, an enhanced algorithm consisting of motion detection algorithm and condensation algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is further integrated with colour changes identification technique which considers the changes in colour on fishes. This is to identify overlapping fishes and to detect the distance between the camera and the fishes in the water. In our case study, a cultured fish tank installed with water sensors to monitor water pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature is set up together with two network cameras. Koi fishes are chosen due to their active swimming behaviour, variety of colours and easy-to-adapt habitat in the water. A real-time prototype system which models the fish swimming pattern consisting of the enhanced algorithm and the colour changes identification is developed. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Colour changes identification; Condensation algorithm; Fish tracking; Motion detection,Colour change; Condensation algorithm; Fish swimming; Fish tank; Identification techniques; Motion detection; Movement speed; Network cameras; Object tracking algorithm; Prototype system; Swimming behaviours; Swimming patterns; Water sensors; Algorithms; Biochemical oxygen demand; Color; Condensation; Innovation; Research; Sensors; Fish,,,,,,,"Jing, T., How-Lung, E., Stochastic multiple fish tracking using motion and shape consistency, Consumer Electronics (ISCE) (2011) IEEE 15th International Symposium on, pp. 268-271+14-17; Muizz, W.A., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., (2010) Framework for Modelling Fish Behaviour Through Fish Swimming Pattern, , PASSIVE 2010, Le Quartz, Brest, France; Wong, P.L., Osman, M.A., Talib, A.Z., Yahya, K., Modelling of Fish Swimming Patterns Using an Enhanced Object Tracking Algorithm (2011) 3rd International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA 2011), , 3CA 2011, Zhuhai, China; Information on Motion Detection Algorithms, , http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audiovideo/Motion_Detection.aspx; Meier, E.B., Ade, F., Tracking cars in range images using the CONDENSATION algorithm, "" Intelligent Transportation Systems, 1999.

Nonetheless, existing system to manage the complaint reports often has the problem of insufficient and ambiguous description about the reported infrastructure which resulting difficulties for the management to take action. The troublesome process of filing a complaint report could have reduced the willingness of public to make a report. Therefore, this paper is to introduce solution to the situation through an infrastructure damage complaining system with location awareness and photo capturing capabilities. The proposed system has been developed and thus the purpose of this paper is to introduce the system from the perspective of system design and architecture and to discuss the practical implications of the system. The proposed system provides an instant and convenient approach for the public to file a complaint report about damaged or faulty infrastructure. The public only need to take a photo with their mobile device and the system will automatically embed the coordination of the facility into the photo with geo-tagging technique. The simplified process of filing a complaint report may encourage the public to be more willing to collaborate with management. The visual information in the photo and location of the facility provide useful for the management team to accurately assess the severity of the damage thus to be able take informed action. As the outcome, the proposed system helps to achieve more effective and efficient management of public infrastructure. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Geo-tagging; Information engineering; Location awareness; Mobile application,Ambiguous description; Damaged infrastructure; Efficient managements; Existing systems; Geo-tagging; Information engineerings; Location awareness; Management team; Mobile applications; Public infrastructures; Reporting systems; Visual information; Computer applications; Innovation; Mobile devices,,,,,,,"Pagani, M., Determinants of Adoption of Third Generation Mobile Multimedia Services (2004) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 18 (3), pp. 46-59; de Reuver, M., Haaker, T., Designing Viable business Models for Context-aware Mobile Services (2009) Telematics and Informatics, 26 (3), pp. 240-248; (2007) Featuring the Handphone Users Survey, , Annonymous: Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, ed.3, Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; Rouvinen, P., Diffusion of Digital Mobile Telephony: Are Developing Countries Different?

This is because even though the 4G network technologies such as IEEE 802.16m and LTE-A is capable of providing 4G performance, the benefits that these technologies extol will not trickle down to the mobile nodes (MN) involved if the network selection method is inefficient. High speed MNs will be a feature of 4G networks as these networks are capable of supporting MNs that move at a speed of up to 250km/hr. Therefore, a network selection mechanism that takes into account MN's mobility scenario is absolutely necessary. Network communication environment that is heterogeneous, whereby MNs with multiple interfaces can connect to is also becoming the norm. This means network selection method that can provide personalized Always Best Connected (ABC) is vital in maximizing the potential of heterogeneous candidate networks (CN) in fulfilling user's needs. This paper discusses how this can be attained using a network selection methodology that encompasses dynamic weights and detailed user requirement data collection. © 2013 IEEE.",4G; ABC; AHP; dynamic weights; GRA,4G mobile communication systems; Telecommunication networks; 4G; ABC; AHP; Dynamic weight; GRA; Wireless telecommunication systems,,,,,,,"Qalhan, A., Qe Ken, C., An adaptive neuro-fuzzy based vertical handoff decision algorithm for wireless heterogeneous networks (2010) Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) 2010 IEEE 21st International Symposium on (Pp. 22712276; Qalhan, A., Qeken, C., An optimum vertical handoff decision algorithm based on adaptive fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm (2012) Wireless Personal Communications, 64 (4), pp. 647-664; Purohit, A.N., A Network detection and selection scheme in heterogeneous wireless network (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 3 (12). , December; Jung, B.Y., Choi, M.S., Youn, H.Y., Song, O., Vertical handover based on the prediction of mobility of mobile node (2010) Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops) 2010 8th IEEE International Confe Rence on (Pp. 534-539; Charilas, D.E., Ourania, M., Nikitopoulos, D., Theologou, M., Packet-switched network selection with the highest QoS in 4G networks (2008) Computer Networks, 52 (1), pp. 248-258; Charilas, D.E., Markaki, O.I., Psarras, J., Constantinou, P., Application of Fuzzy AHP and ELECTRE to network selection (2009) Mobile Lightweight Wireless Systems, pp. 63-73. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Charilas, D.E., Panagopoulos, A.D., Network selection problem: Multi-access radio network environment (2010) IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, , doi: 10.1109/MVT.2010.939107; Charilas, D.E., Athanasios, D.P., Ourania, I.M., A unified network selection framework using principal component analysis and multi attribute decision making (2012) Wireless Personal Communications, pp. 1-19; Ng, D.K.W., Grey system and grey relational model (1994) ACM SIGICE Bulletin, 20 (2), pp. 2-9; Bari, F., Leung, V.C.M., Use of non-monotonic utility in multi-at tribute network selection (2009) Wireless Technology, pp. 21-39. , Springer US; Wang, H., Wang, Z., Feng, G., Hongwu, L.V., Chen, X., Zhu, Q., Intelligent access selection in cognitive networks: A fuzzy neural network approach (2012) Journal of Computational Information Systems, 8 (21), pp. 8877-8884; Savitha, K., Chandrasekar, C., (2011) C.

This paper describes a method to model a virtual shadow puppet play using sophisticated computer graphics techniques available in Adobe Flash in order to allow interactive play in real-time environment as well as producing realistic animation. Areal-time method is proposed to produce the shadow image that allows interactive play of the virtual shadow puppets by using texture mapping and blending techniques. Special effects such as lighting and blurring effects for virtual shadow puppet play environment are also proposed. Moreover, the use of geometric transformations and hierarchical modeling facilitates interaction among the different parts of the puppet during animation. In essence, our methods and techniques have overcome various limitations of the existing works in virtual shadow puppet play. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Animation; Blending; Interactive Play; Real-Time; Shadow Puppet Play; Virtual Storytelling; Visual Simulation,Interactive Play; Real-Time; Shadow Puppet Play; Virtual storytelling; Visual simulation; Animation; Blending; Mathematical transformations; Interactive computer graphics,,,,,,,"Matusky, P., (1993) Malaysian Shadow Play and Music: Continuity of An Oral Tradition, , Oxford University Press; Edward, V.N., (1980) Javanese Wayang Kulit: An Introduction, , Oxford University Press; Salij, H.J., (1982) Shadow Play and Other Stories, , Heinemann Singapore; Liu, J., (1998) Chinese Shadow Puppet Plays, , Morning Glory Publishers; David, C., (2008) Shadow Puppets & Shadow Play, , Crowood Press; Silva, A., Vala, M., Paiva, A.C.R., Papous: The virtual storyteller (2001) IVA 2001.

The authorities publish notices on the notice boards and sent patrolling car to each agriculture areas to broadcast farming scheduling information to farmers using mobile loud speaker. Besides, farmers rely on weather forecast information from local television channels, and newspapers to plan their farming activities. The inability of getting instant access to information which is crucial to farming has posed the farmers to greater vulnerability of their livelihoods. Currently, farmers are not exposed to ICT integrated application which can help them to manage their daily farming activities and provide accurate weather forecast. Therefore, GreenEve2Peace that uses a modern way of information dissemination by utilizing mobile technology is introduced for the farming community. The approach is design to provide timely information on paddy planting activities, pest and disease control, weather forecast service and allow two way communications among the farmers and the authorities via the Short Message Service (SMS) and online portal. In this paper, we relate our experience in deploying the approach for farming community in a selected area in Malaysia. The approach manage to improve farmers' livelihood by providing them better access to information, enhance their human capital, strengthen the connectivity among farmers and the authority, and saves cost and time. The problems in this study included farmers acceptance level towards ICT integration in agriculture and to identify a sustainable business model to deliver the service without relying on governmental support. © 2012 Infonomics Society.",agriculture management; farming community; mobile technology; short messaging services,Agriculture management; Agriculture sectors; Farming activities; farming community; Human capitals; Integrated applications; IS design; Malaysia; Mobile Technology; Scheduling information; Short message services; Short messaging service; Sustainable business; Television channel; Two way communications; Weather forecast services; Weather forecasts; Information dissemination; Information science; Information technology; Message passing; Telecommunication equipment; Weather forecasting; Agriculture,,,,,,,"Grimshaw, D.J., Kala, S., (2011) Strengthening Rural Livelihoods: The Impacts of Information and Communication Technologies in Asia, , Warwickshire: Practical Action Publishing; (2011), http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/ Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf, Malaysia.

On the other hand, looking into the providers in Malaysia allows the identification of business model adopted, challenges and future trend in the market. This study takes two approaches in looking into the research problem. Selfadministrated survey is adopted in the demand side investigation which involves end-consumers, whereas qualitative interview is deployed in the supplier side investigation which involves providers of mobile contents. The findings of this study could assist the practitioner especially mobile content developers to understand the market in Malaysia, and enable them to serve their customers better.

Several methods have been proposed so that unique characteristics of flowers can be extracted with increased accuracy. Establishing this process as a mobile flower identification service for the public requires major adaptation of the system due to numerous picture requests being received simultaneously. This paper presents a framework for grid-based mobile flower recognition that employs 1) grid computing technology for further optimization of multiple concurrent image processing and 2) mobile wireless communication as the primary data transfer for accessing this mobile service.

The tool or method used in this scenario is known as pull-technology. As a solution, this study proposed an online shopping widget which automatically retrieves relevant online information from various sources at single point of time based on the concept of push technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate the acceptance level of the proposed online shopping widget among Malaysian, through applying technology acceptance theory in questionnaire survey method. The findings of this study imply that the overall acceptance level of Malaysian toward the proposed online shopping widget is considered as low. In addition, the result of this study also suggested that perceived usefulness of the sidebar widget is the strongest antecedent which lead to the intention of use of the online shopping widget. This study has provided a foundation to both practitioners (e.g. software developers) and academicians for understanding of the acceptance level of similar push technology-based online shopping widget, and the characteristics the online shopping widget should incorporated in order to enhance acceptance level among prospective users.",Online shopping; Push technology; Sidebar widget; Technology acceptance theory,Malaysians; New product; On-line information; Online shopping; Perceived usefulness; Prospective buyers; Push technology; Questionnaire surveys; Sidebar widget; Single point; Software developer; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance theory; Web-page; Electronic commerce; Surveys; Technology,,,,,,,"(2008) E-payments Gaining Popularity, , http://startechcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file=/2008/1/1/technology/ 19850887&sec=technology, [cited 2008 27 November]; Available from; Watabe, K., Iwasaki, K., (2007) Factors Affecting Consumer Decisions About Purchases at Online Shops and Stores, p. 88; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new technologies?

The average adoption rate in Asian countries is low compared to that in western countries. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the current situation regarding online shopping behavior in Asian countries, especially Malaysia. The factors that are believed to influence consumers' adoption of e-commerce fall into three main categories: consumer attitudes towards online transaction processing systems, the security and privacy of consumer personal information within merchant systems, and trust in reliability of online vendors. This study provides a foundational understanding of how security and privacy issue in online transactions, and trust in reliability of online vendors affect consumers' confidence in participating in e-commerce. Therefore, those organizations that are involved in e-commerce are expected to take note of the findings, especially in Malaysia context. © 2010 IEEE.",Adoption; E-commerce; Online security; Online shopping,Adoption; Asian countries; Consumer attitudes; Current situation; E-Commerce; Growth and development; Malaysia; On-line securities; Online shopping; Online transaction; Online transaction processing systems; Online vendors; Personal information; Security and privacy; Security and privacy issues; Western countries; Data privacy; Online systems; Electronic commerce,,,,,,,"(2008) Internet World Stats in 2008, , www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, [InternetJ.Available at.] [Accessed 18 Oct 2009]; (2006) Online Retail Sales Grew in 2005, , www.e-commerceguide.com/resources/market_research/article.php/157001, [Internet].

By studying automatic vectorization methods we can reveal the maturity of the tested methods whether as a research prototype or a commercial software. Arc Segmentation Contest held in conjunction with the eighth IAPR International Workshop on Graphics Recognition (GREC'09) is an excellent opportunity for researchers to present the results of their proposed raster to vector methods. The contest provides a uniform platform where the output of different methods can be analyzed. The relevance of the contest is further revealed by the creation of new test images with their ground truth data. Old documents were used in this contest. Five methods participated (two research prototypes and three commercial software). Two tests were performed namely between-methods test (participated by all methods) and within-method test (participated by only one method).

The tool or method used in this scenario is known as pull-technology. As a solution, this study proposed an online shopping widget which automatically retrieves relevant online shopping information from various sources at single point of time based on the concept of push technology. In relevant to this, the objective of this paper is to investigate the acceptance level of the proposed online shopping widget among Malaysians, through applying technology acceptance theory in questionnaire survey. The findings of this study imply that the overall acceptance level of alaysians toward the proposed online shopping widget is considered as relatively low. In addition, the result of this study also suggested that perceived usefulness of the sidebar widget is the strongest antecedent which led to the intention of use of the online shopping widget. This study has provided a foundation to both practitioners (e.g. software developers) and academicians for understanding of the acceptance level of similar push technology-based online shopping widget, and the characteristics the online shopping widget (especially usefulness and ease-of-use) should incorporated in order to enhance acceptance level among prospective users.",Online shopping; Push technology; Sidebar widget; Technology acceptance theory,,,,,,,,"(2008) E-payments Gaining Popularity, , http://startechcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file=/2008/1/1/technology/19850887&sec=technology, 27 November, Available:; Pastore, M., (2000) Online Consumer Spending Growth Slowing, , http://cyberatlas.internet.com/markets/retailing/article/0,6061_271961,00.html, Available:; Watabe, K., Iwasaki, K., Factors Affecting Consumer Decisions About Purchases At Online Shops and Stores (2007), p. 88; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new technologies?

One of the main causes is the failure to manage a journey. Vehicles tend to choose the shortest paths which ended up congesting a certain area. If a journey is well managed, using alternative paths may lead to the same destination in a shorter period of time. Therefore, with the importance of sustainable environment, intelligent route planning system has become a popular research agenda among researchers and industries. In this paper, an enhanced algorithm based on A*-search algorithm is proposed. The enhanced algorithm is used to study the traffic congestion level as well as to suggest the best route to a destination. The algorithm takes the traffic congestion level into consideration, which makes choosing the best route possible in minimal travel time. © 2009 IEEE.",,Alternative path; Research agenda; Route planning system; Search Algorithms; Shortest path; Sustainable environment; Travel time; Learning algorithms; Routing algorithms; Traffic surveys; Traffic congestion,,,,,,,"National Transportation Studies, , http://www.bts.gov/publications/national-transportation-statistics, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed August 28, 2008; Heavy Traffic Bad For Your Heart (2004) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3761012.stm, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed 21 st October; Keiichi, U., Hideki, S., Tooru, N., Genetic Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem in Delivery System (1994) Vehicle Navigation & Information Systems Conference Proceedings; Ryan, L., Sushil, J.L., Chris, M., Using A Genetic Algorithm To Explore A*-Like Path Finding Algorithms, , Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno; Traffic Congestion, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wikiTraffic-congestion, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed 28 March, 2008; Kenneth, A.B., Paul, J.L., (2005) Algorithms: Sequential, Parallel and Distributed, Thomson Course Technology; A* Search Algorithm, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*-search-algorithm, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed September 5, 2008; A.
