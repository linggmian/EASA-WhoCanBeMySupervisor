Static analysis has the ability to observe all possible software paths in an application through the scrutiny of a web application’s source code. Among those paths, some may be considered feasible paths, which refer to any paths that the test cases can execute. The detection of feasible paths in the results of a static analysis helps to minimize the false positive rate. However, the detection of feasible paths can be challenging, especially for programs that have multiple conditions in the same branch. The aim is to ensure that each feasible path is detected only once (not duplicated). This paper proposes an approach based on minimal static single assignment (MSSA) form and symbolic execution to detect feasible paths. The proposed approach starts by converting the source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), followed by converting the AST to minimal SSA representation, which helps to decrease the number of instructions in the SSA form. An algorithm was built to examine all of the instructions of the SSA form, identify whole paths in the source code, and extract constraints along each path. A path weight method (PWM) is proposed in this work to avoid detecting duplicated feasible paths. The satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver was used to check the satisfiability of each path condition. The proposed approach was tested on seven well-known test programs that have been used in related studies and 10 large scale programs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method (PWM) can avoid detecting duplicated feasible paths, and the proposed approach reduced the time required for generating the paths compared to that in related studies. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of digital contact tracing apps is to accelerate existing traditional face to face interview method which can control the pandemic effectively and rapidly. A major concern is whether consumers will be willing to download, install, and use the contact tracing applications because of the debate it created about its main attribute like security, privacy concern, system framework, data processing, location measurement. In this paper we discuss the contact tracing apps and its different architecture, then we analyze the framework in term of security, privacy concern and privacy policy. We reported 47 contact tracing applications which are from 28 countries worldwide, with several others expected to be roll out later. We found that 23 percent of contact tracing apps currently implemented do not provide privacy policy in their documentation. We believe that these comprehensive evaluation and specific suggestions will lead to creation and implementation of solutions towards Covid-19 and support governments and mobile development industries in creating safe and privacy conserving apps for contact tracing solutions. © 2021.

Undeniably it has brought change to the world we live in and to our minds. It has more memory about us than any of the real humans. Social network is a dumpster of peoples' personal information from your date of birth to your current location it has all the information. If process well, this could get even scarier day by day. Motivated by the fact that privacy issue is one of the main concerns of the users, this paper is determined to discuss and elaborate the privacy features settings of the famous Social networking sites (SNS). In this paper we compare three of the most famous SNS, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The differences and commonalities among those SNS will be compared based on a list of criteria. Based on the comparison, Facebook has been proven having the highest number of flexible privacy features that allow users to choose as compared to the other SNS. © 2020 IEEE.","Component; Privacy; Security;

With various attack studies that had been published over 15 years, this paper intends to survey, investigate and classify these studies' paradigm in the perspective of study type, attack mode, target type and mitigation suggestion. Knowledge of these studies' paradigm will allow for an in-depth understanding of the practice, direction and trend of Tor attack studies over the years. In addition, this will present a better comprehension on the diverse techniques used in Tor attack studies. At the end of this study, specific trends of Tor attack studies could be highlighted. Out of 85 reviewed Tor attack studies, only five is non-experimental studies. The most focus attack mode is an active attack and followed by a passive attack. For the target type, the majority of the studies is concentrating on the user as their attack target. Also, out of 85 reviewed Tor attack studies, only 32 studies had discussed a mitigation technique to their proposed attack. © 2020 IEEE.","analysis; anonymity; attack; privacy; security; tor","Active attack; Attack target; Diverse techniques; In-depth understanding; Mitigation techniques; Passive attacks; Target type; Various attacks",,,,,,,"Shirazi, F., Simeonovski, M., Asghar, M.R., Backes, M., Diaz, C., A survey on routing in anonymous communication protocols (2018) Acm Comput.

This technique is considered as the most effective tool that is used in human-computer interaction studies to test the usability of information systems. Moreover, this technique is widely adopted to analyze the usability of applications as it is inexpensive and quick.The objective of this study is to use the heuristic evaluation principals to assess the effectiveness of the stock exchange mobile application in Malaysia. Questionnaire survey method was used and data were collected by 25 participants from Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). The heuristic evaluation was conducted by 25 experts to examine the usefulness of stock exchange mobile application. The results revealed that stock exchange application is an effective and useful application that has all required features. Meanwhile, findings also postulated that most of the users show agreeableness regarding the applications of principals of heuristics evaluation in this application. These heuristic principals can further used to avoid the usability gaps in this stock exchange application.This study also gives guidelines to designers for taking corrective measures during the designing of the applications for the stock exchange. Additionally, these guidelines help to provide solutions in the future that how designers may improve the user interface of these stock exchange applications that may improve the experience of users. © 2020 SERSC.",,,,,,,,,"Abdul Rahman, A.K., (2012) Usability Testing for Learnability and Efficiency on UUM Digital Library System, , Doctoral dissertation, Universiti Utara Malaysia; Adelman, L., Riedel, S.L., (2012) Handbook for Evaluating Knowledge-Based Systems: Conceptual Framework and Compendium of Methods, , Springer Science & Business Media; Alonso-Ríos, D., Mosqueira-Rey, E., Moret-Bonillo, V., A Systematic and Generalizable Approach to the Heuristic Evaluation of User Interfaces (2018) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 1-14; Avilés Monroy, J., (2015) Study on Heuristic Usability Evaluation for Mobile Applications, , Doctoral dissertation, ETSI_Informatica; Basilisco, R., Cha, K.J., Uses and gratification motivation for using Facebook and the impact of Facebook usage on social capital and life satisfaction among Filipino users (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9 (4), pp. 181-194; Baker, K., Greenberg, S., Gutwin, C., (2004) Empirical Development of a Heuristic Evaluation Methodology for Shared Workspace Groupware, 96. , https://doi.org/10.1145/587078.587093; Behler, A., Lush, B., (2010) Are You Ready for E-Readers?

This paper discusses a readability issues in privacy policies and how privacy scholars approach the issue. The paper also compares and analyzes research results on readability measurement of privacy policies and divides them into two categories according to different perspective. The perspective includes readability measurement from reader's perspective and readability measurement from privacy policies text content’s perspective. Our finding shows that website providers should give consumers better control regarding their information and give them more freedom in privacy policies. Only then will consumers become liberated from the burden of choosing between 2 unspeakable options. A legally binding document on the privacy policy can be written, that will also be clear and simple to read. © 2020 SERSC.","Information privacy; Privacy; Privacy Policies; Readability; Security",,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., (2006) ).

However, there is a lack of thorough comprehension of the deanonymise outcome in Tor attack studies. Comparing the attack outcome from one study to another could be ambiguous especially on the anonymity perspective. It is expected that with proper categorisation of the deanonymise outcome, comparison between Tor attack studies in deanonymise outcome perspective could be much more transparent and precise. Hence, this study aims to provide thorough classifications of the deanonymise outcome of Tor attack studies. To achieve that, an in-depth discussion on the anonymity principals that Tor is providing is presented. Then, a set of deanonymise outcome classification is being defined correspond to the current Tor’s deanonymise attack studies outcome. Finally, it can be revealed that over the years, communication entities correlation has received the most attention compared to other categories of the deanonymise outcome on Tor attack studies. © 2020 SERSC.","Anonymity; Attack; Deanonymize; Privacy; Security; Tor",,,,,,"11800","This research was supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia (KPM) for ??Security Model: Website Fingerprinting on darknet illegal marketplaces for transaction traffic identification using machine learning?

It specifies the functions to notify, to warn and to advice users about the consequence or any possible menaces by allowing random applications to run on the computer system. However, the majority of computer user tends to ignore security warnings that convey excessive technical messages which are difficult for user to understand and lead to lack of motivation for decision making. A survey utilised 250 participants had been conducted to address end-user’s comprehension about the warnings based on their browser’s preference. The results revealed that most users preferred to use Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox as compared to Safari and Internet Explorer. It can be noted that users experienced significant challenges to comprehend the signal icons and technical jargon based on the presented warnings. There is a corresponding need to design a usable security warning that able to ease end-users security decision. © 2020 SERSC.","Human computer interaction security; Information security; Security; Usability; Usable security",,,,,,,,"Ahmad, F.N.A., Zaaba, Z.F., Aminuddin, M.A.I.M., Abdullah, N.L., Empirical Investigations on Usability of Security Warning Dialogs: End Users Experience (2020) Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1132, pp. 335-349; Amran, A., Zaaba, Z.F., Singh, M.M., Marashdih, A.W., Usable Security: Revealing End-Users Comprehensions on Security Warnings (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 124, pp. 624-631; Amran, A., Zaaba, Z.F., Mahinderjit Singh, M.K., Habituation effects in computer security warning (2018) Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 27 (2), pp. 119-131; Bravo-Lillo, C.A., (2014) Improving Computer Security Dialogs: An Exploration of Attention and Habituation, , PhD Thesis, Carnegie Mellon University; (2017) The 'Not Secure' Warning in Google Chrome and How to Avoid It, , https://www.brightlabs.com.au/page/Blog/not-secure-warning-google-chrome/, Accessed: 28 February 2018; Emang, D.W.A.B., Zaaba, Z.F., Hussain, A., Mohd, N.A., Preliminary Insights in Security Warning Studies: An Exploration in University Context (2019) Procedia Computer Science, 161, pp. 1191-1198; Hussein, I., Hussain, A., Mkpojiogu, E.O.C., Nathan, S.S., Zaaba, Z.F., The knowledge of human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience design (UXD) in malaysia: An analysis of the characteristics of an HCI-focused conference (2019) International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering, 8 (8), pp. 483-490; (2018) Warning Messages, , https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/messages, Online, Accessed: 4 January 2020; (2017) Warning, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/warning, Available at:, [Accessed: 5 January 2020]; Samsudin, N.F., Zaaba, Z.F., Further Investigation on Security Warnings Implementation: A Case in Higher Institution (2017) Advanced Research in Engineering and Information Technology (AREITIC)”, Bandung, Indonesia, Advanced.

Thus, it poses to the increasing number of attacks as a result of using various application and tools. Security warning conveys an alert on the potential harm users might expose such as malware and any kind of attacks on their computer. In practice, most of the end users tend to ignore the security warning as it shows the messages repeatedly, although they have been exposed to many risks. A security warning dialogue is supposed to catch the user’s attention and comprehension however, because of users’ past experiences such habituation makes them became less focus. One-to-one interview session with 60 participants was conducted in order to gain further comprehension among the end users experiencing security warning and to investigate the usability issues of current security warning implementation. It is deemed of necessity to discover these usability issues in the current context of security warning presentations. The result revealed that the problems and challenges continue to persist such as difficulties to make a decision, difficulties to comprehend technical jargons, lack of attractiveness of current security warning and issues of habituation or repeated exposures of warnings. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Human-computer interaction; Security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security","Human computer interaction; Malware; Usability engineering; Empirical investigation; Potential harm; Problems and challenges; Security; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User experience",,,,,,,"Mahajan, A., 3.6 Billion Active Internet Users Worldwide by 2018 with Nearly 50% Penetration, , https://dazeinfo.com/2014/11/26/india-overtake-us-second-largest-internet-user-base-2015-half-world-internet-access-2018-emarketer/, Accessed 31 Sept 2018; Passeri, P., Cyber Attacks Statistics, , https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018/02/22/january-2018-cyber-attacks-statistics/, Accessed 31 Sept 2018; Amran, A., Zaaba, Z., Mahinderjit Singh, M., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings (2017) 4Th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2017, pp. 635-631. , Elsevier B.V., Penang; Wogalter, M., Purposes and scope of warnings (2006) Hum.

Effective security warning is critical to provide a secure environment to end-users to against attack. However, users always encounter problems and challenges when they encounter security warnings due to the poor warning dialogue interface. Element used in the warning interface is important to support users to make an effective decision. A poor warning design will lead a user to become a fraud victim. Hence, there is a need to design an effective warning dialogue by providing useful security features. Although the efficacy of security warning is depending on the interface of security feature, but also highly dependent on the user’s perception and understanding. This paper determine to investigates further from the end-user’s experience whilst encountering security warnings (i.e. Chrome browser context). An exploratory interview study with 65 participants was conducted to pursue in-depth information about the perceptiveness of users towards current security warnings in three different scenarios. The results show that elements such as icon, colour, wording used in the warning can impact the efficacy of the warning. All the user feedback indicated that there is still room for improvement on the current security warning. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Browser security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security; Warning dialogue","Security systems; Browser security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security; Warning dialogue; Web browsers",,,,,,,"https://www.statista.com/chart/7451/chrome-most-vulnerable-browser/, Accessed 21 Dec 2018; Laughery, K.R., Wogalter, M.S., Designing effective warnings (2006) Rev.

This attack hampers the adoption and deployment of cloud computing. DDoS Attack is an explicit attempt by an attacker to prevent and deny access to shared services or resources on a server in a cloud environment by legitimate users of cloud computing. This kind of attack targets victim servers by sending massive volumes of traffic from multiple sources to consume all the victim server resources. This paper discussed various defense mechanisms for defending DDoS. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate different mechanisms that help to defend DDoS attacks. This paper highlights the importance of statistical anomaly-based approaches in detecting DDoS attacks. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Anomaly detection; Cloud computing; DDoS; Defense taxonomy","Anomaly detection; Cloud computing; Network security; Cloud computing environments; Cloud environments; DDoS; Defense mechanism; Detection mechanism; Different mechanisms; Distributed denial of service attack; Server resources; Denial-of-service attack",,,,,,,"Somani, G., Gaur, M.S., Sanghi, D., Conti, M., Buyya, R., DDoS attacks in cloud computing: Issues, taxonomy, and future directions (2017) Comput.

This assessment was done based on an analysis carried out from the characteristics of attendees of an HCI-focused conference held in Malaysia. The study observed among others that attendance by practitioners at the conference was comparatively low when compared to comparable conferences in western countries and was also characterized by a low level of knowledge among the HCI-focused conference attendees. The conference was more of a learner’s conference than a conference of experienced experts. The empirical results provided information regarding the low practice of HCI and UXD among practitioners and poor level of awareness of the importance of user involvement in the software development process. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

The web browser threats need to be prevented with their solutions. Cryptography is an area of computer science that provides security for data transmission to make the data more accurate, accountability, authentication, and confidentiality. Encryption algorithm plays an important role in securing the information or data. Different encryption algorithm (symmetric, asymmetric) has been used to achieve the security of data. Yet, those algorithms consume many computing resources such as computation time, battery power and memory. This paper presents the web browser threats and solution for it to make the web browser more secure and shows the most compatible algorithm for the web browsers. At the end of this study, AES is found to be the best algorithm for web browser security as it offers highest encryption rate, smallest memory usage, and currently the most secure algorithm. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

By using the Tor network, a user can browser without anyone know the truth of the communication information. Numerous studies have been performed worldwide on deanonymizing the Tor user. One of popular study is the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, a subset of passive traffic analysis attack. WF consists of complex traffic analytical process with several limitations and assumptions on the Tor network. In this paper, we will discuss the fundamental principal of WF on Tor network, its assumptions and discussion on whether WF is considered as applicable on attacking the Tor user anonymity(especially in real-world scenario).As a result, the applicability discussion and establishment are presented.

Where a web application accepts a user-input, it is possible for such vulnerability to inject malicious scripts. The greater part of the literature concentrated on the application of static analysis in order to locate XSS vulnerabilities. The reason for this is its capability of achieving effectively a 100 percent code coverage and observing every path of the program. Nevertheless, the main restriction of static analysis, being the false positive rate shown in the results, continues. Consequently, researchers began to merge static analysis with other algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, machine learning and pattern matching. This is to improve the XSS detection results as well as the static analysis run time. This essay defines the algorithms which formerly improved the static analysis outcomes regarding XSS vulnerability detection. Furthermore, each method's restriction was mentioned in which the studies continue to lack an efficient detection of XSS vulnerability in PHP web application. © 2019 The Authors.","Cross site scripting;

On the other hand, regular computer users tend to ignore the security warning that conveys excessive technical messages which are difficult for them to understand and lead to lack of motivation for decision making. Consequently, an online survey has been utilized by a group of 250 participants to gain general insights based on the user's understanding of security warning. This paper describes one main finding utilizing the Chi-Square test. From the finding, it can be suggested that 2 hypotheses were statistically significant in terms of user's understanding and their assessments towards computer security warning. On the other hand, variable of gender indicates with the highest significant values with three statistically significant 0.004, 0.017 and 0.000 respectively The overall results from the test given indicate that for each variable were connected between computer user's skills and their understanding in order to improve security warning in the future. © 2019 The Authors.","Chi square; Human computer interaction; Security warning; Usability; Usable security","Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Security of data; Statistical tests; Surveys; Chi square; Chi-square tests; Computer users; Online surveys; Security warning; University context; Usability; Usable security; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,"Dourish, P., Grinter, R., Delgado De La Flor, J., Joseph, M., Security in the wild: User strategies for managing security as an everyday, practical problem (2004) Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 8 (6), pp. 391-401; Zaaba, Z.F., (2014) Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (ASIA), , PhD Thesis, University of Plymouth; Krol, K., Moroz, M., Sasse, M.A., Don't work.

However, due to security and usability issues, only 29% of users convert their online search into a purchase. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing evaluation models in the aspect of usability and security dimensions for an e-commerce website. This study reviewed the evaluation models that have been applied to E-commerce from the year 2000 to 2018. The study reviewed 11 models and listed the usability and security elements evaluated by each model. The strength and weakness of each model was highlighted. This study found that there is a lack of one comprehensive model that is able to measure all the usability components together with the security components. There is a need to design an evaluation model that will be able to evaluate usability and security together for e-commerce website in order to improvise the e-commerce website. © 2019 The Authors.","E-commerce; Security; Usability","Electronic commerce; Information systems; Information use; Usability engineering; Websites; Comprehensive model; E-commerce websites; Evaluation modeling; Security; Security and usabilities; Security components; Usability; Usability and security; Web Design",,,,,,,"Kraemer, K.L., Dedrick, J., Melville, N., Zhu, K., (2006) Global E-Commerce:Impacts of National Environments and Policy, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Rainer, K., Cegielski, C., (2011) Introduction to Information Systems: Enabling and Transforming Business, Third Edition, , John Wiley and Sons Inc; Laudon, K.C., Traver, C.G., (2002) E-Commerce: Business, Technology, , Society, Addison Wesley, Boston, MA; Nielsen, J., (2003) Usability 101: Introduction to Usability, , http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030825.html; Nielsen, J., Norman, D., (2000) Web-Site Usability: Usability on the Web Isn'T A Luxury, , http://www.informationweek.com/773/web.html; Jokela, T., Usability capability models - Review and analysis (2000) HCI 2000, , Sunderland, UK; Samsudin, N.F., Zaaba, Z.F., Singh, M.M., Samsudin, A., Symbolism in computer security warnings: Signal icons and signal words (2016) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), 7 (10), pp. 148-153; Zaaba, Z.F., Furnell, S.M., Dowland, P.S., A study on improving security warnings (2016) The 5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for the Muslim World (ICT4M), pp. 1-5; Samsudin, N.F., Zaaba, Z.F., Security warning life cycle: Challenges and Panacea (2017) Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering (JTEC), 9 (2-5), pp. 53-57; Amran, A., Zaaba, Z.F., Singh, M.K.M., Habituation effects in computer security warning (2018) Information Security Journal: A Global Perspectives, 27 (2), pp. 119-131; Amran, A., Zaaba, Z.F., Singh, M.K.M., Marashdi, A.W., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 1124, pp. 624-631; Li, F., Li, Y., Usability evaluation of e-commerce on B2C websites in China (2011) Procedia Engineering, 15, pp. 5299-5304; (2011) Systems and Software Engineering - Systems and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) - System and Software Quality Models, , ISO/IEC 25010; Seffah, A., Metzker, E., The obstacles and myths of usability and software (2004) Communications of the ACM, 47 (12), pp. 71-76; Pastore, M., (2001) Europeans Increasingly Turn to the Net for Travel, , http://cyberatlas.internet.com/markets/travel/article/0,6071_554271,00.html; Matera, M., Rizzo, F., Toffetti Carughi, G., Web usability: Principles and evaluation methods (2006) Web Engineering, pp. 143-180. , E.

These have increased the productivity in the workplace. The purpose of having a conference paper app is to aid researcher to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of management of conference paper. Without a proper management of these substances, people might suffer from the inconvenience by using a desktop system to complete certain tasks and monitor them efficiently. However, based on investigating the existing applications, a few shortcomings have been identified. Certain shortcoming leads us to develop a new mobile application to fix the identified shortcomings. Some others include complex navigation of user interfaces, this cause a poor user experience for users. Hence, this project proposes a development of a mobile application that is called CPMA, which serve as a better alternative tool to allow users managing and monitoring information related to conference paper in a more efficient way. This app specifically developed for researchers in higher learning institutions who are needed to proceed with conference paper. Software development methodology named prototyping will be adopted, which consisted of phases such as planning, repeated phases (analysis, design, implementation and system prototype), implementation and final system. The essential significance of this project is to provide a platform for researcher to manage and monitor conference paper in a savvy manner. By the time of completing this project, users are expected to access this application without any costs and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of managing conference paper.

In 2017, Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report shows that Malaysia ranks 25th out of 141 countries and fifth best country in Asia. Within Malaysia, Penang has become one of the top tourists visited among others. The Penang capital city Georgetown has widely known for its UNESCO World Heritage recognition since 2008. Despite having such overwhelming responds and recognition, there is still deficiency of technology in tourism industry. Being one of the enormous market growths in technology industry, smart phone has become one of the necessity items. People utilize this platform more in their daily life. Nowadays, there are a lot of applications existed in respective market store that could help the tourists whilst traveling. Nevertheless, in perspective Malaysia, there are only few have been identified. Such applications are MalaysiaTripAdvisor, Pg Tourism, Smart-l. All these applications basically focus on one specific area. Hence, the need to rely on the other applications is obligatory and important. Besides that, there is no planner element that could help the tourists managing their journey in this country. To overcome this, an application called MyTouristPlanner (MTP) is proposed that utilizes the tourist guide features into a single application which help to ease users' problem. The aspects of usability of such system has been significantly improved. © 2018 IEEE.","interactive; mobile application; smart phone; tourism; usability","Commerce; Telephone sets; interactive; Mobile applications; Technology industry; tourism; Tourism application; Travel and tourism; UNESCO world heritages; usability; Smartphones",,,,,,,"(2017) Visit Malaysia Year, , http://www.tourism.gov.my/campaigns/view/visit-malaysia-year, Tourism Malaysia [Accessed: 23 September 2017]; (2017) KUDOS for Malaysia: TRULY Asia CAMPAIGN, , http://www.tourism.gov.my/media/view/kudos-for-malaysia-truly-asiacampaign, Tourism Malaysia [Accessed: 23 September 2017]; Awani, A., (2016) Kedatangan Pelancong Meningkat Kepada 13. 03 Juta Orang Setakat Jun, , http://www.astroawani.com/berita-malaysia/kedatangan-pelancongmeningkat-kepada-13-03-juta-orang-setakat-jun-118636, [Accessed: 24 September 2017]; (2017) Malaysia Targets 31 Million Tourists This Year, , http://matta.org.my/news/76358-malaysia-targets-31-million-tourists-this-year, MATTA [Accessed: 26 October 2017]; (2017) Malaysia Eyes $52. 4 Billion Tourism Revenue by 2020, , http://www.travelbiznews.com/news/item/1841-malaysia-eyes-$524-billion-tourism-revenue-by-2020, [Accessed: 26 October 2017]; Isinkaye, F.O., Folajimi, Y.O., Ojokoh, B.A., Recommendation systems: Principles, methods and evaluation (2015) Egyptian Informatics Journal, 16 (3), pp. 261-273. , November 2015; (2016) An Introduction to Recommender Systems, , http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783319296579-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1556374-p179516130, [Accessed: 7 November 2017]; Li, H., Cai, F., Liao, Z., Content-based filtering recommendation algorithm using HMM (2012) 2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences on, pp. 275-277. , 17-19 August 2012; Umanets, A., Ferreira, A., Leite, N., Guideme-a tourist guide with a recommender system and social interaction (2013) Conference on Electronics, Telecommunications and Computers-CETC 2013, pp. 407-414; Burke, R., Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments (2000) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 2002, pp. 331-370; (2018) The JTDS Project, , http://jtds.sourceforge.net/, [Accessed: 15 April 2018]; Emang, D.W.A.B., Lukman, R.N.I.R., Kamarulzaman, M.I.S., Zaaba, Z.F., Usability studies on e-learning platforms: Preliminary study in USM (2017) AIP Conference Proceedings, 1891 (1), p. 020040; Yen, L.P., Zaaba, Z.F., Malaycious: Usable mobile food finding application (2016) 8th Knowledge Management International Conference (KMICe) 2016, pp. 284-290. , Chiang Mai, Thailand; Zaaba, Z.F., Furnell, S.M., Dowland, P.S., End-user perception and usability of information security (2011) Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security & Assurance (HAISA), pp. 97-107. , London","Zaaba, Z.F.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: zarulfitri@usm.my",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 International Conference on Promising Electronic Technologies, ICPET 2018","3 October 2018 through 4 October 2018",,142466,,9781538656976,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The traditional way of knowing when the waste will be collected in the housing area is not accurate nowadays as sometimes they fail to collect the waste without any reasons. The platform provided by the waste management company which is through Facebook or their website to make announcement regarding the waste collection process is not so effective as sometimes user missed the news and it is quite troublesome for them to check the website. Hence, to overcome the problems, My Intelligent Bin (MIB) is introduced. The main objectives of MIB are to investigate problems and challenges in waste management system and proposing android mobile application as a platform to manage and monitor the waste management system in real time.

A number of the most commonly utilised frameworks for web applications are written in PHP. They became main targets because a vast number of servers are running these applications throughout the world. This increase in web application utilisation has made it more attractive to both users and hackers. According to the latest web security reports and research, cross site scripting (XSS) is the most popular vulnerability in PHP web application. XSS is considered an injection type of attack, which results in the theft of sensitive data, cookies, and sessions. Several tools and approaches have focused on detecting this kind of vulnerability in PHP source code. However, it is still a current problem in PHP web applications. This paper describes the popularity of PHP technology among other technologies, and highlight the approaches used to detect the most common vulnerabilities on PHP web applications, which is XSS. In addition, the discussion and the conclusion with future direction of research within this domain are highlighted. © 2018 IEEE.","Cross Site Scripting; Software Security; Vulnerability; Web Application Security; XSS","Network security; Personal computing; Cross site scripting; Current problems; PHP web applications; Sensitive datas; Software security; Vulnerability; WEB application; Web application security; Application programs",,,,,,,"Yusof, I., Al-Sakib, K.P., Mitigating cross-site scripting attacks with a content security policy (2016) Computer, 49, pp. 56-63. , April; Shar, L.K., Briand, L.C., Tan, H.B.K., Web application vulnerability prediction using hybrid program analysis and machine learning (2015) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 12, pp. 688-707. , November; Deepa, G., Thilagam, P.S., Securing web applications from injection and logic vulnerabilities: Approaches and challenges (2016) Information and Software Technology, 74, pp. 160-180. , June; https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/acunetix-vulnerability-testingreport-2017/, Acunetix, Acunetix Vulnerability Testing Report 2017.

By improving static analysis is necessary to obtain accurate results and lessen the occurrence of false positive results. Being able to detect infeasible paths is useful in the improvement and development of the results of static analysis. However, the process that is used to identify these infeasible paths is not simple, especially because numerous tools and methods still do not have the efficiency in detecting these kinds of paths within the static analysis. This paper investigates the current approaches to detect infeasible paths in the static analysis and discusses the challenges further. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,"Da Fonseca, M., Vieira, M.P.A., A practical experience on the impact of plugins in web security 2014 IEEE 33rd International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS), pp. 21-30;

Back then, a specific button is assigned as a security lock button such as the asterisk yet major concerns on security issues over personal data stored in mobile phones have been raised. Password-based authentication took over the trend with pattern and PIN unlock being commonly used by users of mobile phones. However, these methods are still prone to fraud as unethical users tend to break the passcode using shoulder surfing or hacking. To further strengthen the security in mobile phones, biometric authentication approaches are proposed. In this paper, four biometric-based authentication methods are being compared through a several aspects.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus been paid to address this issue, the main objective of this paper is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This paper presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings.

It significantly improves users’ experience during sensing activities since their active involvement in the labeling process is reduced. An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of “non-sensitive” and “sensitive” data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Naïve Bayes classifier. With the hybridized machine learning (unsupervised and supervised) technique presented in this paper, unlabeled sensor data was automatically annotated and then classified. © 2018 by the authors.","Activity recognition; Clustering; Data security; Multivariate data; Sensitive data","Location; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Security of data; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Activity recognition; Automatic annotation; Clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Location information; Multivariate data; Sensitive datas; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,"Capponi, A., Fiandrino, C., Kliazovich, D., Bouvry, P., Giordano, S.A., Cost-effective distributed framework for data collection in cloud-based mobile crowd sensing architectures (2017) IEEE Trans.

This study provides an empirical model to detect individual terrorist using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiling. In the research design and analysis approach, four metric values of DNA materials guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine form a dataset were assigned to a sample of a hundred people and tested using regression analysis. The tests were conducted to generate a mathematical model that minimizes errors in the experiment. After model evaluations and validations, the result shows 99.43% detection rate accuracy. The model was used to measure the weight of individual involvement in crime such as cybercrime, and terrorism as presented by the people’s DNA test. The result from this study performs better when compared with the recent studies of other state-of-the-art techniques such as text analysis, machine learning algorithms, data mining, high efficiency video coding detection and statistical mixture models identification. Therefore, we proposed an empirical model using DNA profiling for identifying individuals involved in terrorism to enable empirical evidence in a forensic investigation. © IAEME Publication.","Crime detection; Empirical model; Individual DNA profiling; Terrorism",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","We thank the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Penang, Malaysia.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn, and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus paid to address this issue, the main objective of this article is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This article presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges, and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this article could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning","Computer science; Information science; Habituation; security; usability; Usable security; warning; Security of data",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6313287","This work was supported by a short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].",,"Zaaba, Z.F.email: zarulfitri@usm.my",,,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",,,,,19393555,,,,"English","Inf.

Tor protect its user privacy against surveillance and censorship using strong encryption and obfuscation techniques which makes it extremely difficult to monitor and identify users' activity on the Tor network. It also implements strong defense to protect the users against traffic features extraction and website fingerprinting. However, the strong anonymity also became the heaven for criminal to avoid network tracing. Therefore, numerous of research has been performed on encrypted traffic analyzing and classification using machine learning techniques. This paper presents survey on existing approaches for classification of Tor and other encrypted traffic. There is preliminary discussion on machine learning approaches and Tor network. Next, there are comparison of the surveyed traffic classification and discussion on their classification properties. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Encrypted traffic monitoring; Machine learning; Security; Survey; Tor",,,,,,,,"Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Syverson, P., 'Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router,' (2004) SSYM'04 Proc. 13th Conf.

Online survey utilising 116 participants were conducted to investigate the end-users understanding and satisfaction on E-learning platform in the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). The results indicate that mainly students still experiencing significant challenges in E-learning platform in regard to accessibility, technical terminologies and functionality. On the other hand, the 10-heuristic guideline is chosen to be a referral point to compare five E-learning platforms in order to assess each performance on regards to the usability criteria. Overall, USM E-learning platform can be considered in a good shape. However, there are more works to be done to improve the delivery system of the E-learning if it would like to sustain for a long period of time.

From the big mall to a small shop, many security measures have been put in place as prevention tools. Apparently, there are numbers of shoplifting prevention tools in the market such as the Closedcircuit Television (CCTV), Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) and Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST). However, the cost issues and the ease of use always become the main concerns for the shopkeepers. Therefore CCTV was widely accepted because of the ease and affordable price. Although the CCTV is their main preference, it can be noted that CCTV operates in a static way where it can only records and monitor the incidents. This paper highlights the conventional CCTV issues and proposes the Intelligent Responsive Indoor System (IRiS) the as security crime prevention tool that uses face detection, recognition and behavior analysis to detect potential shoplifting intentions. Six small shop owners were interviewed to understand their insights on the problems and the need to further enhance the current CCTV. In addition, detailed discussions were provided in relation to the development of IRiS. Therefore, it can be suggested that IRiS provides a significant foundation and promises to be a security prevention tool to improve the conventional functions of the CCTV.","Biometrics; Face recognition; Human computer interaction; Intelligent system; Security; Security alerts",,,,,,,,"(2015) Shoplifter goes through checkout with 32 stolen iphones, , http://6abc.com/news/shoplifter-goes-throughcheckout-with-32-stolen-iphones/1043391/; Ahonen, T., Hadid, A., Pietikainen, M., Face recognition with Local Binary Pattern (2004) Lecturer Notes in Computer Science, 3021, pp. 469-481; Arigbabu, O.A., Syed Ahmad, S.M., Wan Adnan, W.A., Yussof, S., Mahmood, S., Soft biometric: Gender recognition from unconstrained face images using local feature descriptor (2015) Journal of ICT, 14, pp. 111-122; (2015) Electronic article surveillance, , http://www.agon-systems.com/electronic-article-surveillance/, Retrieved 8 December 2015; Belhumeur, P.N., Hespanha, J.P., Kriegman, D.J., Eigenfaces vs (1997) Fisherfaces: Recognition using class specific linear projection.

By reviewing the literature pertaining to XSS vulnerability, it has been found that many investigations have directed their energy only on XSS vulnerability detection, but not many studies have concentrated on removing XSS vulnerability. This paper embed the removal stage of XSS vulnerability to our previous approach of detection XSS vulnerability, in a way to make the approach fully to detect and remove XSS vulnerability from PHP source code. We conducted two experiments to detect and remove Reflected and Stored XSS vulnerability. The results show that our approach is able to detect and remove XSS vulnerability in PHP source code. More research is required in the field of removing XSS vulnerability from the application source code before deployment. © 2017 IEEE.","Cross Site Scripting; Security Vulnerability; Software Security; Vulnerability Removal; Web Application Security; XSS","Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Network security; Cross site scripting; PHP web applications; Security issues; Security vulnerabilities; Software security; Vulnerability detection; WEB application; Web application security; Application programs",,,,,,,"Kumar, R., Mitigating the authentication vulnerabilities in Web applications through security requirements (2015) Information and Communication Technologies (WICT), 60 (2), pp. 651-663; Gupta, M.K., Govil, M.C., Singh, G., Predicting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) security vulnerabilities in web applications (2015) 2015 12th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE), Songkhla, pp. 162-167; Gupta, S., Gupta, B.B., (2015) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks and Defense Mechanisms: Classification and State-of-the-art, pp. 1-19. , National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra, Kurukshetra, India; (2017) Cross-site Scripting (XSS)-OWASP, , https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2017-Top_10, OWASP; Hydara, I., Sultan, A.B.M., Zulzalil, H., Admodisastro, N., Current state of research on cross-site scripting (XSS)-A systematic literature review (2015) Information and Software Technology, 58, pp. 170-186; Hydara, I., Sultan, A.B.M., Zulzalil, H., Admodisastro, N., Cross-Site Scripting Detection Based on an Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (30), pp. 1-7; Guo, X., Jin, S., Zhang, Y., XSS vulnerability detection using optimized attack vector repertory (2015) International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge (CyberC), pp. 29-36; Ahmed, M.A., Ali, F., Multiple path testing for cross site scripting using genetic algorithms (2015) Journal of Systems Architecture, 64, pp. 50-62. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2015.11.001; Shar, L.K., Tan, H.B.K., Briand, L.C., Mining SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities using hybrid program analysis (2013) 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13), pp. 642-651; Shar, L.K., Tan, H.B.K., Automated removal of cross site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications (2012) Information and Software Technology, 54 (5), pp. 467-478; Hydara, I., Sultan, A.B.M., Zulzalil, H., Admodisastro, N., An approach for cross-site scripting detection and removal based on genetic algorithms (2014) The Ninth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances (ICSEA), pp. 227-232; (2010) OWASP Project Information: OWASP Enterprise Security API Project, , https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GPC_Project_Details/OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API_Java_EE_Version, [Accessed: April, 2016]; Malviya, V.K., Saurav, S., Gupta, A., On security issues in web applications through cross site scripting (XSS) (2013) 20th Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC), pp. 583-588; Martirosyan, Y., (2014) Security Evaluation of Web Application Vulnerability Scanners Strengths and Limitations Using Custom Web Application, , www.mcs.csueastbay.edu/~lertaul/YulianaThesis_V8.pdf; Wang, Y., Li, Z., Guo, T., Program slicing stored XSS bugs in web application (2011) Fifth IEEE International Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering, pp. 191-194; Wang, Y., Li, Z., Guo, T., Reflected XSS Vulnerability Analysis (2013) International Research Journal of Computer Science and Information Systems (IRJCSIS), 2 (2), pp. 25-33; Marashdih, A.W., Zaaba, Z.F., Omer, H.K., Web security: Detection of cross site scripting in php web application using genetic algorithm International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (Ijacsa), 8 (5), p. 2017; (2010) OWASP Project Information: OWASP Enterprise Security API Project, , https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Project_InformationOWASP_Enterprise_Security_API_Project; Ceponis, J., Ceponiene, L., Venckauskas, A., Mockus, D., (2013) Evaluation of Open Source Server-Side XSS Protection Solutions, pp. 346-356. , Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; (2015) HTML Purifier, , www.htmlpurifier.org, Documentation",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 International Conference on Promising Electronic Technologies, ICPET 2017","16 October 2017 through 17 October 2017",,132564,,9781538622698,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

However, there is a rising concern on its security. While recent cloud solutions focus on the password-based cryptography, in which a secret key is derived from user’s password, password-based authentication cannot efficiently withstand to password-based attack such as brute-force and dictionary attacks. First, this paper reviews the attack models and security defenses mechanisms of existing public cloud service providers. Subsequently, this paper extends the Honey Encryption scheme to enhance the file storage security on the public cloud computing. The Honey Encryption provides the encrypted data an additional protection layer by providing fake data in response to every incorrect guess on the user’s password. These fake data resemble the actual data and indistinguishable from the attacker’s perspective, therefore hardening the complexity of password guessing. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Brute-force attack; Honey encryption; Password-based encryption; Secure cloud",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/811334","This work was by a research grant from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [1001/PKOMP/811334].

Among those services, online banking becomes the focal point of interest for this paper. One of the advantages of online banking, it makes the financial transaction easier and fast because the website can be accessed by users at their convenient time. Although it helps users to speed up the process, there are significant issues which need to be addressed such as security and privacy challenges in online banking. Therefore, this paper further explains those challenging aspects and determines to describe the security mechanism that had been put in place. Five banking institution were compared and discussed accordingly to assess the similarities and the differences. It is expected that the outcome of this paper will be significant to the developer, banking institutions and research communities to improve the online banking presentation in the future undertakings. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Cryptography; Online banking; Privacy; Security; Usable security; Vulnerabilities",,,,,,,,"Jassal, R.K., Sehgal, R.K., (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 3, p. 1016; (2016), https//www.uscert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Banking_Securely_Online07102006.pdf, US-CERT, Banking Secure Online, viewed 18 April; Steven, P., (2016) Less Hacking More Phishing, Cyber Security Malaysia, , http://www.cybersecuity.my/bahasa/knowledge_bank/news/2005/main/detail/832/index.html, viewed 20 April; (2016), https://www.mycert.org.my/en/services/advisories/mycert/2011/main/detail/832/index.html, Malaysian Computer Emergency Response TeamMYCERT 2nd Quarter 2011 Summary Report, viewed 20 April; David, C.C., Amy, Y.C., (2000) Information System Management, 17, p. 1; Belanger, F., Hiller, J.S., Smith, W.J., (2002) Journal of Strategic Information, 11, p. 245; Furnell, S.M., Karweni, T., (1999) Electronic Networking Applications and Policy, 9, p. 372; Falvian, C., Guinaliu, M., (2006) Industrial Management and Data System, 106, p. 601; Wang, H., Lee, M., Wang, C., (1998) Communications of ACM, 41, p. 63; Lee, M.C., (2008) Electronic Commerce and Applications, 8, p. 130; Kuisma, T., Laukkanen, T., Hiltunen, M., (2007) International Journal of Information Management, 27, p. 75; Sub, B., Han, I., (2002) Electronic Commerce Research and Application, 1, p. 247; Agrwal, R., Rastogi, S., Mehrotra, A., (2009) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 16, p. 340; Lichtenstein, S., Williamson, K., (2006) Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 7, p. 50; Richard, (2016) Human Computer Interface Security, , https://www.embracetherandom.com/hcisec/Intro%20to%20HCISEC.pdf, viewed 25 April; Garfinkel, S., Security and usability: What do we know?

Security warning is designed to warn the users such as notify, inform and advice users about the consequence effect of an action. However, computer user s tend to ignore security warning due to the lack of attentions, did not understand the meaning of the warnings, difficulties on the technical jargon used, lack of motivation and users become habituated to security warning. Therefore, a survey was mounted online utilising 156 participants to investigate and to understand further general understanding of user's perceptions on security warnings. This paper describes two main findings utilising Chi-Square and Cramer's V test. The findings suggested that in all three scenarios, the results were not statistically significant. However, results portrayed in Cramer's V test were in a better outlook. The result indicates on the need to look closely on each variable involves within the study sampling to improve the security warnings. © 2018 The Authors.","Chi Square; Cramer's V Test; Human Computer Interaction; Security Warning; Usability; Usable Security","Information systems; Surveys; Chi Square; Computer users; End users; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User's perceptions; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,"Zaaba, Z.F., (2014) Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (Asia), , PhD Thesis, University of Plymouth; Bravo-Lillo, C.A., (2014) Improving Computer Security Dialogs: An Exploration of Attention and Habituation, , PhD Thesis, Carnegie Mellon University; (2015) Microsoft,Warning Messages, , https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn742473.aspx, [Online] Available at: [Accessed: 20 September 2016]; Wu, M., Miller, C.R., Garfinkel, S.L., (2006) Do Security Toolbars Actually Prevent Phishing Attacks, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference of Human Factors in Computing System, pp. 601-610. , ISB 1-59593-372-7; Seifert, C., Welch, I., Komisarczuk, P., (2006) Effectiveness of Security by Admonition: A Case Study of Security Warnings in A W Eb Browser Setting, , School of Mathematics, Statistic and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington; Sharek, D., Swofford, C., Wogalter, M., (2008) Failure to Recognize Fake Internet Pop Up Warning Message, Proceeding of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 52nd Annual Meeting, pp. 557-580; Sunshine, J., Egelmen, S., Almuhimedi, H., Atri, N., Cranor, L.F., Crying Wolf: An empirical study of ssl warning effectiveness (2009) Proceedings of the 18th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 229-416. , Montreal Canada; Egelmen, S., (2009) Trust Me: Design Patterns for Constructions Trustworthy Trust Indicators, , PhD Thesis, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University; Furnell, S.M., Jusoh, A., Katsabas, A., The challenge of understanding and using security: A survey of end -users (2006) Computer and Security, the International Source of Innovation for the Innovation Security and IT Audit Pr Ofessional; Zaaba, Z.F., Teo, K.B., Examination on usability issues of security warning dialogs (2015) Journal of Multidisciplinary Engineering Science and Technology, 2 (6), pp. 1337-1345; Raja, F., Hawkey, K., Hsu, S., Wang, K.L.C., Beznosov, K., A brick wall, a lock door and a bandit: A physical metaphor for firewall warnings (2011) Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 1-20. , Pittsburg, USA; Brusoloni, J.C., Villamarin-Salomon, R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs (2007) Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85. , Pittsburg, USA; Anderson, B.B., Kirwan, C.B., Jenkins, J.L., Eargle, D., Howard, S., Vance, A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study Processing of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, p. 2883. , 2892; Krol, K., Moroz, M., Sasse, M.A., Don't work.

Security warning is a form of message conveyed to inform user on the risk of allowing an application to run on the computer system. Security warning plays an important role in notify, warn and advise user about the potential result of an action beforehand. However, security warnings are often being ignored due to various reasons such as poor design of security warnings and too many technical terms used in security warnings. This research highlights insights into the discovery of problems and difficulties encountered by the users, approaches in improving security warnings and future direction of the security warning improvement process. We proposed to utilise the hybrid approach of iterative design and mental model in the effort to enhance the current implementation of security warning. Iterative design is a cyclic design process where prototyping, testing and refining are done repeatedly.

Part of the errors is due to mistakes in the medical record or incomplete medical record which may trigger tragic consequences. In this paper, we present an application that manages securely personal health information on a mobile platform and keeps all the medical records of a patient in digital format. Patients are able to access their medical record at their convenience and the confidentiality of information is guaranteed. Patients are also able to share their personal health record with their respective doctor in a secure way. The application consists of several modules: incognito, access control, privacy control, authentication, encryption, multifactor authentication and emergency control. An anonymous database is created by removing all the identifier of a patient before the health record is stored in the database. This provides an extra layer of protection to the patient’s privacy. In particular, our proposed application introduces the multifactor authentication and emergency control modules which provides a multi-layered defense authentication and emergency case handler respectively. Thus, the proposed application allows the patient to assess their records conveniently and securely, and helps them in emergency situations. As such, the application is suitable for cases involving large number of patients and emergency situations such as in Hajj healthcare management. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Access control; Cryptography; Health; Medical problems; Public health; Emergency control; Emergency situation; Health-care managements; Mobile platform; Multi-factor authentication; Personal health informations; Personal health record; Privacy control; Authentication",,,,,,"We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia and the support of the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS), 203.PTS.6728004 from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education.","Alwan, A., (2010) Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases, , World Health Organization, Switzerland; (2010) World Confederation for Physical Therapy, , http://www.wcpt.org/node/33001, January; Gaffar, H.D., Achmadi, U.F., Syamsu, I.P., Hajj health management focussing on the risk factor management (2013) Int.

It is widely used in many organizations nowadays and becoming more popular because it changes the way of how the Information Technology (IT) of an organization is organized and managed. It provides lots of benefits such as simplicity and lower costs, almost unlimited storage, least maintenance, easy utilization, backup and recovery, continuous availability, quality of service, automated software integration, scalability, flexibility and reliability, easy access to information, elasticity, quick deployment and lower barrier to entry. While there is increasing use of cloud computing service in this new era, the security issues of the cloud computing become a challenges. Cloud computing must be safe and secure enough to ensure the privacy of the users. This paper firstly lists out the architecture of the cloud computing, then discuss the most common security issues of using cloud and some solutions to the security issues since security is one of the most critical aspect in cloud computing due to the sensitivity of user's data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Digital storage; Engineering research; Quality of service; Software reliability; Cloud computing services; Internet based computing; Security issues; Software integration; Third parties; Cloud computing",,,,,,,"Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Zaharia, M., (2010) A View of Cloud Computing, Communications of the ACM Magazine, 53, pp. 50-58; Ashraf, I., An overview of service model of cloud computing (2014) Int.

Despite the ease of doing online banking, there are people that still sceptical in utilizing it due to perception and its security. This paper highlights the subject of online banking security in Malaysia, especially from the perspective of the end-users. The study is done by assessing human computer interaction, usability and security. An online survey utilising 137 participants was previously conducted to gain preliminary insights on security issues of online banking in Malaysia. Following from those results, 37 participants were interviewed to gauge deeper understanding about end-users perception on online banking within the context of usable security. The results suggested that most of the end-users are continuingly experiencing significant difficulties especially in relation to the technical terminologies, security features and other technical issues. Although the security features are provided to provide a shield or protection, users are still incapable to cope with the technical aspects of such implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Engineering research; Security of data; Security systems; Surveys; Terminology; Finance management; On-line banking; Security features; Security issues; Technical aspects; Technical terminology; Usability and security; Usable security; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,"Furnell, S.M., Jusoh, A., Katsabas, D., Dowland, P.S., Considering the Usability of End-User Security Software' (2006) Proceedings of 21st IFIP International Information Security Conference (IFIP SEC 2006), pp. 307-316. , 2006b (Karlstad, Sweden,) (Springer Boston); (2015), http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/2519/2580469/addit_chmatl/TURBMC03_0131854615Ex.pdf, Capabilities Of Online Banking M.

In addition, this study also explored the underlying dimensions of the vacation motives and determinants factors. Questionnaires were distributed using convenient sampling utilizing 252 tourists and were analyzed using SPSS program. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was deployed to determine whether the derived vacation motives and determinants varied among groups of socio-demographic and travelling characteristics. The findings indicated that the social-demographic factors placed a great influence on the perception of tourist towards Langkawi Island. Travel motivations and determinants were found to be significantly different in means when compared across different socio-demographic factors like age and income level. The findings also revealed the important segmentation variables in the context of consumer behavior literature where it became the contributing factors to develop appropriate marketing strategies to attract travelers. © University of the Aegean.","Socio-demographic; Tourism marketing; Vacation factors; Vacation motives",,,,,,,,"Baloglu, S., Uysal, M., Market Segments for Push and Pull Motivations, A Canonical Correlation Approach (1996) International Journal of Comtemorary Hospitality Management, 8 (3), pp. 32-38; Beh, A., Bruyere, B.I., Segmentation by Visitor Motivation in Three Kenyan National Reserves (2007) Tourism Management, 28, pp. 1464-1471; Biernat, E., Socio-Demographic Determinants of Participation in Swimming Amongst Working Residents of Warsaw (2012) Journal of Human Kinetics, 32, pp. 175-183; Biernat, E., Vikuk, A.P., Tourist Activity Among Urban Singles in View of Socio-Demographic Factors (2012) Studies in Physical Culture and Tourism, 19 (2), pp. 86-93; Crompton, J., Motivation for Pleasure Travel (1979) Annals of Tourism Research, 4, pp. 408-424; Devesa, M., Laguna, M., Palacoi, A., The Role of Motivation in Visitor Satisfaction: Empirical Evidence in Rural Tourism (2010) Tourism Management, 31, pp. 547-552; Fodness, D., Measuring Tourist Motivation (1994) Annals of Tourism Research, 21 (3), pp. 555-581; Goodall, B., Ashworth, G., (1988) Marketing in the Tourism Industry, , United Kingdom: Croom Helm; Goodrich, J.N., The Relationship Between Preferences For and Perceptions of Vacation Destinations: Application of a Choice Model (1978) Journal of Travel Research, 17 (2), pp. 8-13; Heung, V.C., Qu, H., Chu, R., The Relationship between Vacation Factors and Socio-demographic and Travelling Characteristics: The Case of Japanese Leisure Travellers (2001) Toursim Management, 22, pp. 259-269; McCleary, K.W., Weaver, P.A., Do Business Travellers Who Belong to Frequent-Guest Programme Differ From Those Who Don't Belong?

Trust concerns have been raised and the trustworthiness of social networking sites has been questioned. Currently, the trust in social networks is using the single- faceted approach, which is not well personalized, and doesn't account for the subjective views of trust according to each user, but only the general trust believes of a group of population. From our initial survey, we had found that most people can share their information without any doubts on OSN but they normally do not trust all their friends equally and think there is a need of trust management. By adopting the idea of multi-faceted trust model, a user-centric model that can personalize the comments/photos in social network with user's customized traits of trust is proposed. In this paper, the initial result is analyzed in determining the need to enhance the current trust model within the current social networking.","Multi-faceted model; Online social network (OSN); Privacy; Security; Trust; Trust management","Data privacy; Network security; Security of data; Websites; Online social networks (OSN); Personalizations; Security; Social networking sites; Trust; Trust in social networks; Trust management; User-centric modeling; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,"Johnston, J., Eloff, J.H.P., Labuschagne, L., Security and human computer interfaces (2003) Computers & Security, 22 (8), pp. 675-684; Zhang, C., Sun, J., Zhu, X., Fang, Y., Privacy and security for online social networks: Challenges and opportunities (2010) Network, IEEE, 24 (4), p. 13; Gunatilaka, D., (2011) A Survey of Privacy and Security Issues in Social Networks, , http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~jain/cse571-11/ftp/social/index.html; Brandtzæg, P.B., Liidersa, M., Skjetnea, J.H., Too many facebook ""friends""?

They encounter security warnings on daily basis in many situations when dealing with their computer. However, prior studies have shown that users often have difficulty in understanding the warnings, which can pose a particular risk in cases where they are required to make a decision. Well gathered information is needed to help the researchers and other people to further understand this area. This paper describes an overview of studies on security warnings. It covers problems that end users encounter with security warnings, possible solutions and approaches of security warnings and useful classification of security warnings studies. It is expected that this paper will benefit the research community or general public to understand the problems and possible solutions in improving security warnings. © 2014 IEEE.","Interface; Security; Usability; Usable security; Warning","Interfaces (materials); End users; General publics; Research communities; Security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security; Warning; Mobile security",,,,,,,"Wogalter, M.S., Purposes and scope of warnings (2006) Handbook of Warnings, pp. 3-9. , (Human Factors/Ergonomics)"" (Assoc LE, Ed); Tuchscheerer, S., Dittmann, J., Hoppe, T., Krems, J.F., Theoretical analysis of security warnings in vehicles and design challenges for the evaluation of security warnings in virtual environments (2010) Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Digital Engineering, pp. 33-37. , Magdeburg, Germany.

The associated heavier workloads together with tension and pressure often lead to stress-related health problems. People do really deserve a good rest when they come home from their office. As a result, the proposed solution-The Eye 2H is an intelligent system that will use the technique of image processing and face recognition to detect and analyze the human emotion to control the electronic equipment in their house through an intelligent control box. There are several studies highlighted that by controlling the brightness of light, we could affect the emotion or behavior of humans. Thus, we believe that The Eye 2H is capable to fulfill the main objective of the project which is to provide a better living environment for people in order to provide them a harmony and happy (2H) living life. The Eye 2H is capable of boosting the mood and emotion of the residents by controlling the electronic equipment in their house. The feature of turning on light automatically as well as fine-tune the brightness of light according to human emotion mood will give a 'welcoming home' effect to the house owner. Besides that, The Eye 2H is also a green technology project as it will support the Go Green concept by reducing the energy usage. © 2014 IEEE.","automated light control; lighting effects; smart lights; stress","Automation; Electronic equipment; Energy utilization; Houses; Image processing; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Luminance; Man machine systems; Oscillators (electronic); Stresses; Energy usage; Green technology; Human emotion; Increasing costs; Light control; Lighting effects; Living environment; Smart homes; Face recognition",,,,,,,"Ramos, H., Mustafa, M., Chin, M., The moderating effects of personality on work-family conflicts and stress among Malaysian working parents (2012) International Journal of Management Practice, 5 (3), pp. 225-244; Allen, T.D., Kiburz, K.M., Trait mindfulness and work-family balance among working parents: The mediating effects of vitality and sleep quality (2012) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 80 (2), pp. 372-379; (2011) Harris Interactive: 'Stress in the Workplace, , American Psychological Association; Miller, G.E., Chen, E., Parker, K.J., Psychological stress in childhood and susceptibility to the chronic diseases of aging: Moving toward a model of behavioral and biological mechanisms (2011) Psychological Bulletin, 137 (6), pp. 959-997; Sanders, M.R., Stallman, H.M.M., Workplace Triple P: A controlled evaluation of a parenting intervention for working parents.

The study made use of an online survey consisting of five sections and recruited a total of 564 participants. Respondents were presented with a range of questions designed to measure their experience and knowledge of security. In addition, 2 scenarios were presented to respondents which examined their understanding of security warnings and potential threats, including email phishing and a potentially fraudulent attack through downloading an application. The survey results revealed that end-users are still experiencing significant difficulties with understanding and reacting to current state-of-the-art security applications, messages and potential threats. Furthermore, evidence suggests there is a corresponding need for a novel approach to improve perception and usability of information security.","Human Computer Interaction; Interface; Messages; Perceptions; Security; Usability; Warning","Human computer interaction; Interfaces (materials); Mobile security; Sensory perception; Surveys; Usability engineering; Messages; Potential threats; Security; Security application; Security features; Security warning; Usability; Warning; Security of data",,,,,,,"Albrechtsen, E., A qualitative study of users' view on information security (2007) Computers & Security, 26 (4), pp. 276-289; Coffee, P., (2006) Security Onus is on Developers, , http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Security-Onus-Is-on-Developers/, (Online), (Accessed: 03/03/11); Furnell, S.M., Bryant S, P., Phippen, A.D., Assessing the security perceptions of personal internet users (2007) Computers & Security, 26 (5), pp. 410-417; (1998) ISO 9241 Part 11: Guidance on Usability, , http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883, (Online), (Accessed: 04/03/11); Mannan, M., Van Oorschot, P.C., Security and usability: The gap in real-world online banking (2008) Proceedings of the 2007 Workshop on New Security Paradigms, pp. 1-14. , New Hampshire ACM; (2011) Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines, , http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511440.aspx, (Online), (Accessed: 03/04/2011); Mouratidis, H., Giorgini, P., Manson, G., When security meets software engineering: A case of modelling secure information systems (2005) Information Systems, 30 (8), pp. 609-629; Nielsen, J., (2003) Usability 101: Introduction to Usability, , http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030825.html, (Online), (Accessed: 01/03/11); Proctor, R.W., Lien, M.-C., Salvendy, G., Schultz, E.E., A task analysis of usability in third-party authentication (2000) Information Security Bulletin, 5, pp. 49-56. , (W3schools); Radle, K., Young, S., Partnering usability with development: How three organizations succeeded (2001) Software, IEEE, 18 (1), pp. 38-45; Saltzer, J.H., Schroeder, M.D., The protection of information in computer systems (1975) Proceedings of the IEEE, 63 (9), pp. 1278-1308; Schultz, E.E., Research on usability in information security (2007) Computer Fraud & Security, 2007 (6), pp. 8-10; Tondel, I.A., Jaatun, M.G., Meland, P.H., Security requirements for the rest of us: A survey (2008) Software, IEEE, 25 (1), pp. 20-27; Venter, H., Eloff, M., Labuschagne, L., Eloff, L., Von Solms, J., Herzog, A., Shahmehri, N., Usability and security of personal firewalls (2007) New Approaches for Security, Privacy and Trust in Complex Environments, pp. 37-48. , Springer Boston; Whitten, A., Tygar, J.D., Why johny can't encrypt: A usability evaluation of pgp 5.0 (1999) Proceedings of the 8th USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 169-184. , Washington D.C; Wool, A., The use and usability of direction-based filtering in firewalls (2004) Computers & Security, 23 (6), pp. 459-468",,"Clarke N.L.Furnell S.M.","British Computer Society;Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE);Emerald","University of Plymouth","5th International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security and Assurance, HAISA 2011","7 July 2011 through 8 July 2011",,111433,,9781841022840,,,"English","Proc.
