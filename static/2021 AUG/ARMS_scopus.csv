The behaviour of granting permissions requested by apps might expose the Android smartphone user to privacy risks. The existing works lack a formalized mathematical model that can quantify user and system applications risks. No multifaceted data collector tool can also be used to monitor the collection of user data and the risk posed by each application. A benchmark of the risk level that alerts the user and distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable risk levels in Android smartphone user does not exist. Hence, to address privacy risk, a formalized privacy model called PRiMo that uses a tree structure and calculus knowledge is proposed. An App-sensor Mobile Data Collector (AMoDaC) is developed and implemented in real life to analyse user data accessed by mobile applications through the permissions granted and the risks involved. A benchmark is proposed by comparing the proposed PRiMo outcome with the existing available testing metrics. The results show that Tools & Utility/Productivity applications posed the highest risk as compared to other categories of applications. Furthermore, 29 users faced low and acceptable risk, while two users faced medium risk. According to the benchmark proposed, users who faced risks below 25% are considered as safe. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed work is 96.8%. © 2021 by the authors.

In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile Cloud Gaming; Network Delay; Playout Delay; Processing Delay; Response Delay,Computer architecture; Image communication systems; Intelligent computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile clouds; Network delays; Playout delay; Processing delay; Response delays; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,,,"http://www.angrybirds.com; https://www.pubgmobile.com; https://www.gameloft.com/en/game/modern-combat-5; https://www.pokemongo.com; http://www.nvidia.com/object/cloud-gaming; Srivastava, P., Khan, R., A review paper on cloud computing Int.

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative awareness communication is an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology in enabling safe, reliable, and efficient transportation management. However, there are many limitations to the implementation of the V2V communication system in the real world. The requirements for applying the V2V communication system to an urban area will be different when implemented within other areas. Therefore, the objectives of this research are focused on analyzing the implementation of the ITS V2V cooperative awareness communication based on local traffic motion constraints in the non-US and non-EU country. This research is accomplished by utilizing the survey-based and simulation-based method. As a case study, this research considers to utilized local traffic motion constraints based on a geographical map, road characteristics, and urban mobility at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) neighborhood in Penang, Malaysia. The simulation results show that the deployment of V2V cooperative awareness communication by considering several local motion constraints has several impacts on the quality of urban travel mobility. The efficiency of travel time could be increased by approximately 19.40 %, and the average of vehicles speed is possible improved until 1.10 m/s. The existence of local traffic motion constraints is very fundamental to create a realistic vehicular mobility model for the deployment of ITS V2V cooperative awareness communication in future development. © 2019 IEEE.",Cooperative Awareness Communication; ITS; Motion Constraints; Traffic Mobility; V2V,Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Roads and streets; Travel time; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Intelligent transportation systems; Motion constraints; Simulation-based method; Traffic mobility; Transportation management; Transportation safety; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicular mobility models; Cooperative communication,,,,,,,"WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 World Health Organization, 7 December 2018; (2019) IEEE Std 1609.0-2019 (Revision of IEEE Std 1609.0-2013), Vol., No., pp. 1-106. , IEEE Guide for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) Architecture 10 April; Harding, J., Powell, G., Yoon, R., Fikentscher, J., Doyle, C., (2014) Vehicleto-vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application, , No. DOT HS 812 014, United States.

Many simulations in VANET develop only message dissemination protocol without considering the safe time needed between moving vehicles and these are rather inaccurate for safety preventions because communications without an effective time gap between vehicles could still lead to collisions. Passenger vehicles avoidance time can be associated with L0-L2 and L3-L5 levels of autonomy, dependent on either human-induced deceleration braking or full automated system braking. Two passenger vehicle avoidance time models have been proposed. The results obtained shows marked differences in the needed avoidance time for safe vehicle braking to avoid a crash.

Designing an accurate and effective pre-crash system to avoid front and back crashes or mitigating crash severity is the priority goal of any vehicle safety system. To improve crash prediction, vehicle context is collected to analyze the severity of a crash based on safe avoidance time between two vehicles. This work proposes a real time crash prediction based on TGFD Crash Severity Factor model for Periodic Safety Message dissemination protocol in VANET. Simulation results show promising improvements for dissemination of PSMs to the vehicles for prevention of road accidents in highway scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.",Collision avoidance; Crash prediction; Safety message dissemination; Vanet,Collision avoidance; Forecasting; Highway accidents; Information dissemination; Roads and streets; Safety factor; Vehicles; Crash avoidance; Crash prediction; Crash severity; Prevention of road accidents; Safety message disseminations; Vanet; Vehicle safety; Vehicle safety systems; Vehicular ad hoc networks,,,,,304/PKOMP/650804/M151,This research work is fully funded by a MAXIS-USM research grant (304/PKOMP/650804/M151),"(2015) Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, , World Health Organization World Health Organization; McDonald, M., Keller, H., Klijnhout, J., Mauro, V., Hall, R., Spence, A., Fakler, O., (2006) Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe: Opportunities for Future Research; Leondes, C.T., Intelligent knowledge-based systems: Business and technology in the new millennium (2010) Springer Science & Business Media; Hartenstein, H., Laberteaux, K., (2009) VANET: Vehicular Applications and Inter-networking Technologies, 1. , John Wiley & Sons.

Mobile application plays a crucial role among smartphone users. It has gained enormous support from the smartphone users ranging from young to elder generations. It is very common to download and install desired mobile applications from application store to aid in completing particular tasks with ease. However, this behavior exposes user towards privacy risk as it has become a concern in smartphone usage. In this research, we propose a mathematical model named Privacy Risk Model (PRiMo) that measures the risk score of a user in smartphone usage. We are approaching the privacy issues in mobile applications from the individual's perspective. We conduct studies on different categories of mobile applications to determine the risk posed by the mobile applications. There is no standardization for residual risk. Therefore, by using the proposed model, we are exploring and creating a standardization for residual risk that becomes a benchmark for user to accept and live with that risk. © 2019 The Authors.",Mobile application; Privacy risk score; Residual risk; Sensitive data risk; Sensor,Behavioral research; Data privacy; Information systems; Information use; Mobile computing; Quality of service; Sensors; Smartphones; Standardization; Application stores; Data exposure; Mobile applications; Privacy preservation; Privacy risks; Quality of service model; Residual risk; Sensitive datas; Risk assessment,,,,,"1001/PKOMP/8014003

APT attack has several variants of attacks such social engineering techniques via spear phishing, watering hole and whaling. APTGuard exhibits the ability to predict spear phishing URLs accurately using ensemble learning that combines decision tree and neural network. The URL is obtained from the SMS content received on the smart phones and sent to the server for filtering, classifying, logging and finally informing the administrator of the classification outcome. APTGuard can predict and detect APT from spear phishing but it does not have the ability of automated intervention on the user receiving the spear phishing URL. As a result, APTGuard is capable to extract the features of the URL and then classify it accordingly using ensemble learner which combines decision tree and neural network accurately. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Advanced persistent Threat (APT); Data mining; Ensemble learning; Neural network; Spear-phishing,Android (operating system); Computer crime; Decision trees; Fisheries; Forecasting; Information filtering; Neural networks; Smartphones; Advanced persistent Threat (APT); Android smartphone; Apt attacks; Ensemble learning; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Data mining,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304/PKOMP/650804/M151",This work is supported by USM-Maxis Grant No: 304/PKOMP/650804/M151,"(2012) Cyber Defense: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and Insider Threat, , https://cyber-defense.sans.org/blog/2012/10/23/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-and-insider-threat, cited 2016 19 September 2016; Tankard, C., Advanced persistent threats and how to monitor and deter them (2011) Network Security, 2011 (8), pp. 16-19; (2016) Anatomy of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Attack, , https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/anatomy-of-a-cyber-attack.html, cited 2016 20 September 2016; Sood, A.K., Enbody, R.J., Targeted cyberattacks: A superset of advanced persistent threats (2013) IEEE Security & Privacy, 11 (1), pp. 54-61; Lab, K., Kaspersky Lab and Synerscope Join Forces to Battle Cyberthreats with Big Data Analytics, , http://www.kaspersky.co.in/about/news/business/2016/Kaspersky-Lab-and-SynerScope-join-forces-to-battle-cyberthreats-with-big-data-analytics, cited 2016 22 September 2016; Krebsonsecurity, , https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/03/seagate-phish-exposes-all-employee-w-2s/, cited 2017 25 April 2017; Best Defense against Spear-Phishing, , https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/best-defense-against-spear-phishing-attacks.html, cited 2017 25 April 2017; Sans-Information Security Resources, , https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what-is-a-false-positive-and-why-are-false-positives-a-problem/2/8, cited 2016 19 September 2016; Sans-Information Security Resources, , https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what-is-a-false-negative/2/9, cited 2016 19 September 2016; Lin, C.-H., (2015) Efficient Spear-Phishing Threat Detection Using Hypervisor Monitor, , Security Technology (ICCST), 2015 International Carnahan Conference on; Research, D., The Impact of Mobile Devices on Information Security: A Surveys of IT Professionals (2013) Dimensional Research; Chen, P., Desmet, L., Huygens, C., (2014) A Study on Advanced Persistent Threats. in IFIP International Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security; Mohammad, R.M., Thabtah, F., McCluskey, L., Intelligent rule-based phishing websites classification (2014) IET Information Security, 8 (3), pp. 153-160; Anatomy of an APT Attack: Step by Step Approach, , http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/anatomy-of-an-apt-attack-step-by-step-approach/, cited 2017 25 April 2017; Basnet, R.B., Sung, A.H., Liu, Q., Rule-based phishing attack detection (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Security and Management-Sam","Chuan, B.L.J.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: bernard.ucom13@student.usm.my",Alfred R.Ibrahim A.A.A.Lim Y.Anthony P.,,Springer Verlag,"5th International Conference on Computational Science and Technology, ICCST 2018",29 August 2018 through 30 August 2018,,217739,18761100,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

However, several issues due to the dynamic nature of VANETs disrupt the efficiency of safety message dissemination. Clustering is a common solution applied to overcome VANET challenges. If a Cluster Head is exposed to accidents, it would lose its role and disband the cluster. When re-clustering happens frequently, a greater amount of overhead is produced. This work presents a modified version of the original Safe Clustering Algorithm (M-SCA) whereby safety distance is applied in the cluster maintenance stage to extend the cluster phase.

The utilization of NFC technology in U-Learning concept will help to improve accessibility and encourage collaborative learning methods in the education sector. In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate eleven (11) adoptions factors of U-Learning with NFC and ranking them using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. We also utilized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology Readiness (TR), and combination of TAM and TR (TRAM) as theoretical framework. We have identified TRAM as the best tool based on literature review and utilized the theory to propose an NFC-Enabled Ubiquitous Technology model. The model was utilized to design a questionnaire for survey about user acceptance. Results from the online survey were analyzed using AHP in an absolute measurement approach method. Results from AHP show that optimism is the most influencing factor in adoption of U-Learning using NFC technology followed by innovativeness and accessibility. Finally, this paper contributes in designing an NFC research model. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.",Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); Multi criteria decision making (MCDM); Ubiquitous learning (U-Learning); Virtual learning,,,,,,,,"Ebner, M., Maierhuber, M., Near Field Communication-Which Potentials Does NFC Bring for Teaching and Learning Materials?

Many of these devices rely on personal identification numbers (PIN) as a form of user authentication. One of the main concerns in the use of mobile devices is the possibility of a breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. Threats can possibly come from friends as well as strangers. Smart devices can be easily lost due to their small size, thereby exposing details of users’ private lives. User behavior authentication is designed to overcome this problem by utilizing user behavioral techniques to continuously assess user identity. This study proposed a behavioral data profiling technique that utilizes data collected from the user behavior application to verify the identity of the user in a continuous manner. By utilizing a combination of analytical hierarchy process and correlation coefficient method, the best experimental results were obtained by verifying the identity of six types of user behaviors to determine the different behaviors. Based on the results, this study proposes a new authentication technique that enables verification of a user’s identity through their application usage in a transparent manner. Behavioral data profiling is designed in a modular manner that will not reject user access based on a single application activity but on several consecutive abnormal application usages to balance the trade-off between security and usability. The proposed framework is evaluated using a PIN-based technique and achieved an overall 95% confidence level. Behavioral data profiling provides a significant improvement in the security afforded to the device and user convenience. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Correlation coefficient; Decision-making; Security of smartphone; User behavior,Authentication; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Abnormal applications; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Authentication techniques; Correlation coefficient; Correlation coefficient method; Personal identification number; Security and usabilities; User behaviors; Behavioral research,,,,,,,"Guo, C., Wang, H.J., Zhu, W., Smart-phone attacks and defenses (2004) Hotnets, p.

Through these functionalities, Smartphone owner can exchange information to each other by sharing links or even files. However, an attacker see these as an advantage to perform an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT is an attack which incorporates both social engineering attack and malware. In this paper, the authors will shed light on how APT attack through spear phishing can occur in Smartphone and how to detect it. First, the authors will examine the tactics that can be used by the attacker to perform a successful social engineering attack. Then, based on the discussion that has been made, the authors have used a machine learning algorithm to classify whether a certain URL is a phish or not. Lastly, the authors have evaluated the propose technique using machine learning and obtained more than 90% accuracy. This proves, that the proposed technique would able to help mitigating APT attack through spear phishing in the Smartphone. © 2018 The Authors.",Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Cyber Crime; Decision Tree; Smart Phone; Typosquat,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Decision trees; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Smartphones; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Attack detection; Cyber-crimes; Multi-purpose; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Typosquat; Malware,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.,"APT Research Team TrendLab, Spear-phishing email: Most favored apt attack bait (research paper), Report (2012); Baumgartner, K., Raiu, C., Maslennikov, D., (2013) Android Trojan Found in Targeted Attack, , https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/35552/android-trojan-found-in-targeted-attack-58/, [Online].

Parameters such as system load, service characteristics and user mobility are the main criteria in network selection strategy. In this paper, we devise a mobility estimation method for a Mobile Node (MN) during initial network selection and Vertical Handover (VHO). The method relies on a new prediction dwelling time and the Call Holding Time (CHT) of a user. By comparing the predicted dwelling time with the CHT, a MN is able to make decision which network is suitable to be used in order to minimize the VHO.

Service providers constantly looking for suitable technologies and mechanisms to reduce the network congestion by offloading the data traffic, where Wi-Fi is an excellent option. In the traffic steering process, network selection is the most vital process, as it affects the user’s network experience. This paper focuses on enhancing the procedure of Call Admission Control (CAC). Two key functions were introduced into the call admission procedure, namely Channel Reserve Engine (CRE) and Traffic Steering Policy (TSP). Based on the simulation results, it is found the proposed CAC reduces the call blocking probability as compared with conventional CAC.

Drivers control the vehicle directly or supervise the situation according to information displayed on the instrument panel. Different from the time-headway and traditional braking models, this paper aims to propose a new safety indicator called time gap interval for safe following distance (TGFD) which incorporates vehicle dynamics and driver behavior factors that includes the time component to broadcast and propagate suitable safety messages in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment. This simulation-based safety indicator could analyze the capability of a vehicle in a car-following situation to safely stop without hitting the vehicle in front when an emergency brake is applied by considering the proper reaction time of the driver of the following. Results from this simulation study indicate that the TGFD is more comprehensive safety indicator for safety analysis. © 2014 IEEE.",Collision Avoidance; Safe Distance; Time Gap; VANET,Collision avoidance; Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Vehicles; Dynamic cooperation; Safe distance; Safety indicator; Simulation studies; Time gap; VANET; Vehicle dynamics; Wireless vehicular networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks,,,,,,,"Brackstone, M., McDonald, M., Car-following: A historical review (1999) Transportation Research Part F, 2 (4), pp. 181-196; Gipps, P.G., A behavioural car-following model for computer simulation (1981) Transportation Research Part B, 15 (2), pp. 105-111; Werling, M., Kaempchen, N., Wollherr, D., Buss, M., Lanebased safety assessment of road scenes using Inevitable Collision States (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV '12), pp. 31-36. , Alcala de Henares, Spain; Adell, E., Várhelyi, A., Fontana, M.D., The effects of adriver assistance system for safe speed and safe distance- A real-life field study (2011) Transportation Research Part C, 19 (1), pp. 145-155; Kannan, S., Thangavelu, A., Kalivaradhan, R.B., An intelligent driver assistance system (I-DAS) for vehicle safety modelling using ontology approach (2010) International Journal of UbiComp, 1 (3), pp. 15-29; Biral, F., Da Lio, M., Saroldi, A., Tango, F., Bertolazzi, E., Supporting drivers in keeping safe speed and safe distance: The SASPENCE subproject within the European framework programme 6 integrating project PReVENT (2010) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 11 (3), pp. 525-538; Wu, Y., Xie, J., Du, L., Hou, Z., Analysis on trafficsafety distance of considering the deceleration of the current vehicle (2009) InProceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Computing Technology and Automation (ICICTA '09), pp. 491-494. , Changsha, China, October; Luo, Q., Xun, L., Cao, Z., Huang, Y., Simulation analysis and study on car-following safety distance model based on braking process of leading vehicle (2011) InProceedings of the of 9th World Congress OnIntelligent Control and Automation (WCICA'11), pp. 740-743. , Taipei, China; Ayres, T.J., Li, L., Schleuning, D., Young, D., Preferred timeheadway of highway drivers (2001) Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Proceedings, pp. 826-829. , Oakland, Calif, USA, August; Touran, A., Brackstone, M.A., McDonald, M., A collision model for safety evaluation of autonomous intelligent cruise control (1999) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 31 (5), pp. 567-578; Tordeux, A., Lassarre, S., Roussignol, A.N.D.M., An adaptive t ime-g a p car-following model (2010) Transportation Research Part B : Methodological, 44 (8-9), pp. 1115-1131; Lin, T., Hwang, S., Green, P., Effects of time-gap settings of adaptive cruise control (acc) on driving performance and subjective acceptance in a bus driving simulator (2009) Safety Science, 47 (5), pp. 620-625; Karim, M.R., Minimum safe time gap (MSTG) as a new safety indicator incorporating vehicle and driver factors (2013) Proceedings of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 9; McGee, (1983) Highway Design and Operation Standards Affected by Driver Characteristics, 2. , Final Technical Report, Bellomo-McGee, Inc.

The mobile device flexibility has encouraged users to turn their mobile devices into primary hubs for storing information. This paper adopts the classical CW-Lite security models as the framework and the human behavioral patterns as the context. The selected behavioral aspects refer to mobile application and mobility, deployed as major characteristics that determine security control decisions. This proposed paper requires the application of human behavioral context on mobile phones. The solution involves the novel use of behavioral aspects to improve the security of mobile phones. Two important scenarios are incorporated: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mobile application and AHP mobility. The proposed methodology is superior because it can detect the change in the user behavior in comparison with an intruder. The applied intelligent human behavioral context on the CW-Lite model shows the advantages of AHP in detecting the changes in the user behavior and in authenticating the identity of the main user. These advantages ensure reliability and security of the phone. © 2015 The Authors.",Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision making; CW-Lite security model; User authentication,Analytic hierarchy process; Authentication; Cellular telephones; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Information systems; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Social sciences; Telephone sets; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Behavioral patterns; Mobile app; Mobile applications; Security controls; Security model; User authentication; User behaviors; Behavioral research,,,,,,,"Liu, Z., Hong, Y., Pi, D., A large-scale study of web password habits of chinese network users (2014) Journal of Software, 9 (2), pp. 293-297; Liu, T., Bahl, P., Chlamtac, I., Mobility modeling, location tracking, and trajectory prediction in wireless atm networks, Selected Areas in Communications (1998) IEEE Journal on, 16 (6), pp. 922-936; Bajaj, R., Ranaweera, S.L., Agrawal, D.P., Gps: Location-tracking technology (2002) Computer, 35 (4), pp. 92-94; Song, C., Qu, Z., Blumm, N., Barabási, A.-L., Limits of predictability in human mobility (2010) Science, 327 (5968), pp. 1018-1021; Phithakkitnukoon, S., Horanont, T., Di Lorenzo, G., Shibasaki, R., Ratti, C., Activity-aware map: Identifying human daily activity pattern using mobile phone data (2010) Human Behavior Understanding, Springer, pp. 14-25; Bigun, J., Fiérrez-Aguilar, J., Ortega-Garcia, J., Gonzalez-Rodriguez, J., Combining biometric evidence for person authentication (2005) Advanced Studies in Biometrics, Springer, pp. 1-18; Dinh, H.T., Lee, C., Niyato, D., Wang, P., A survey of mobile cloud computing: Architecture, applications, and approaches (2013) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 13 (18), pp. 1587-1611; Brosso, I., La Neve, A., (2012) Adaptive Security Policy Using User Behavior Analysis and Human Elements of Information Security, , INTECH Open Access Publisher; Barnes-Holmes, D., Barnes-Holmes, Y., Cullinan, V., Relational frame theory and skinner's verbal behavior: A possible synthesis (2000) The Behavior Analyst, 23 (1), p. 69; Shankar, U., Jaeger, T., Sailer, R., Toward automated information-flow integrity verification for security-critical applications (2006) NDSS; Muthukumaran, D., Schiffman, J., Hassan, M., Sawani, A., Rao, V., Jaeger, T., Protecting the integrity of trusted applications in mobile phone systems (2011) Security and Communication Networks, 4 (6), pp. 633-650; Saaty, T., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) for Decision Making, , Kobe, Japan; Jusoh, Y.Y., Chamili, K., Pa, N.C., Yahaya, J.H., Open source software selection using an analytical hierarchy process (ahp) (2014) American Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 3 (6), pp. 83-89; Sharma, M.J., Moon, I., Bae, H., Analytic hierarchy process to assess and optimize distribution network (2008) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 202 (1), pp. 256-265",,Bordea G.,"Intelligent Control Technology Association;Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (SIAT-CAS);The Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communications (SDIWC)",Elsevier,"3rd Information Systems International Conference, 2015",16 April 2015 through 18 April 2015,,123178,18770509,,,,English,Procedia Comput.

WLAN has been widely used as a complementary service for cellular network operator to offload their traffic. Based on traffic characteristics, user mobility and load balance we propose a new CRRM scheme that include traffic offloading functionality. When a user arrives in out of hot-spot area and no resource is available, the algorithm will identify some of the traffic to be offloaded in the overlap area from cellular network to WLAN and release the resource for the new user to use. The proposed approach also attempts to minimize unnecessary vertical handover (VHO) between cellular and WLAN. The effectiveness of the scheme is assessed analytically using the theory of 3D-Markov Chain. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CRRM scheme increase the overall system throughput, reduce the new call blocking probability and provide less service costs to the users. © 2014 IEEE.",,Blocking probability; Heterogeneous networks; Markov processes; Radio systems; Telecommunication links; Common Radio Resource Management; Complementary services; Heterogeneous wireless network; New call-blocking probability; Numerical results; Resource efficiencies; Traffic characteristics; Vertical handovers; Wireless networks,,,,,,,"Index, C.V.N., (2011) Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2010-2015, , Cisco white paper; Mueck, M., Piipponen, A., Kalliojarvi, K., Dimitrakopoulos, G., Tsagkaris, K., Demestichas, P., Casadevall, F., Baldini, G., Etsi reconfigurable radio systems: Status and future directions on software defined radio and cognitive radio standards (2010) Communications Magazine, IEEE, 48 (9), pp. 78-86; (2009) Study into Network Selection Requirement for non-3gpp, , 3GPP; Yu, F., Krishnamurthy, V., Optimal joint session admission control in integrated wlan and cdma cellular networks with vertical handoff (2007) Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, 6 (1), pp. 126-139; Piamrat, K., Ksentini, A., Bonnin, J.-M., Viho, C., Radio resource management in emerging heterogeneous wireless networks (2011) Computer Communications, 34 (9), pp. 1066-1076; Gelabert, X., Pérez-Romero, J., Sallent, O., Agustí, R., A marko-vian approach to radio access technology selection in heterogeneous multiaccess/multiservice wireless networks (2008) Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, 7 (10), pp. 1257-1270; Gelabert, X., Sallent, O., Pérez-Romero, J., Agustí, R., Performance evaluation of radio access selection strategies in constrained multiaccess/multi-service wireless networks (2011) Computer Networks, 55 (1), pp. 173-192; Hasib, A., Fapojuwo, A.O., Analysis of common radio resource management scheme for end-to-end qos support in multiservice heterogeneous wireless networks (2008) Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 57 (4), pp. 2426-2439; Shi, Z., Zhu, Q., Zhu, X., Performance analysis of an improved common radio resource management algorithm based on load balance and service characteristics (2012) Wireless Personal Communications, pp. 1-22; Mehmeti, F., Spyropoulos, T., Khalife, H., Vania, C., Leguay, J., Sermpezis, P., Khalife, H., Leguay, J., Performance analysis of' on-the-spot"" mobile data offioading (2013) IEEE Globecom, , Accepted; Shi, Z., Zhu, Q., Zhao, S., A vertical handoff rate analysis based on angle mobility model in heterogeneous networks (2012) Signal Processing (Xinhao Chuli), 28 (7), pp. 1029-1036; Gross, D., Harris, C.M., (1985) Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, , John Wiley & Sons; Golub, G.H., Van Loan, C.F., (1996) Matrix Computation, , 3rd ed.

The hop-count is derived by identifying the next-hop node that has the minimum distance to the sink node. Meanwhile, the node-degree is obtained through the vehicle ID of each neighbouring nodes in its radius. All the nodes or vehicles in VANETs context were assumed to be equipped with an OnBoard Unit (OBU) that will periodically send beacon messages to other nodes around the transmission range area. From the simulation results, it is found that the HDbR protocol is suitable to be used in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) as it produces high network throughput and minimum end-to-end delay. Thus it is comparable to existing protocol such as AODV when it was evaluated in various speeds scenario. © 2013 IEEE.",hop-count; node-degree; routing protocol; VANETs,Routing protocols; Vehicle transmissions; End to end delay; High network throughput; Hopcount; Neighbouring nodes; node-degree; Transmission ranges; VANETs; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks,,,,,,,"Spaho, E., Barolli, L., Mino, G., Xhafa, F., Kolici, V., Vanet simulators: A survey on mobility and routing protocols (2011) Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), International Conference, pp. 1-10; Shariff, A.R.M., (2007) A Novel Topology Dependent Model for Hop-by-Hop Routing Using Static Metrics, , Ph.
