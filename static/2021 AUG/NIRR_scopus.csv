To date, we could find many skin care products sold not only in pharmacy but also from individual business. However, not all products suitable for all skin types. As a normal human, we sometimes not know the type of rashes or allergies that we faced. Meeting dermatologist would not be the first choice for many patients – given that the fees are expensive especially. Skin rashes can occur to anybody and an early recognition could avoid the rash become worse. Seeking information online would be the first choice, however patients still in high possibilities in mistakenly buy skin care products. Therefore, the development of the augmented reality application for skin rashes and allergies detection is expected can solve the problem. With the help of dermatologist and healthcare people, the information in this application is established and trustable. Among the advantages of this application are the ability in detecting of different types of skin rashes, displaying informative details on the detected skin rashes to reduce wrong judgement on the allergies the patient faced, and reasonable processing speed on mobile screen. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",3D modeling; Augmented reality; Image processing; Mobile application; Skin rashes,Allergies; Augmented reality; Augmented reality applications; Human bodies; Image modeling; Mobile screens; Processing speed; Skin rashes; Skin care products,,,,,,,"Doctor Mole app 2015 Homepage. https://apkpure.com/doctor-mole-skin-cancer-app/com.rev soft.doctormole.

Failure to adhere to dietary intake recommendation, was one of the most significant factors affecting patient survival. Technology-mediated approach such as web and mobile application could be the most desirable approach nowadays. This paper presents the SMARTS dual application modules development by using ADDIE model, beginning with the analysis of needs, followed by content and face validation in the design phase, and finally the development of application prototype. The application system was designed to enable seamless access, interaction, and monitoring between all the involved users; patient, caretaker, and Healthcare Provider (HCP). Twenty-five respondents involved in the need assessment and also face and validity testing, Most of them are dietitian from government hospital (n = 16, 64%), university medical centers (n = 6, 24%) and private hospital (n = 2, 8%), with ample experience managing hemodialysis patients. Majority of them rated the content (84%), and purpose of the app as a new nutrition education tool (84%) as the most appealing properties of the app, followed by the visual appealing (68%), and variety of topics offered (40%). Some improvisation was suggested on the comprehension and quality of the text, inclusion of nutrient tracker, presentation of education messages in video format, and adding more visuals rather than textual information to enhance understanding. The SMARTS D4D module was well-accepted and supportive of respondents’ needs. Appropriate modifications have been done based on the valuable respondents’ feedbacks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Application module; Dietary plan; Hemodialysis; Kidney failure,Dialysis; Hemodialyzers; Hospitals; Nutrition; Application module; Application systems; General population; Health care providers; Hemodialysis patient; Mobile applications; Private hospitals; Textual information; Software prototyping,,,,,,,"Bujang, M.A., Adnan, T.H., Hashim, N.H., Mohan, K., Kim Liong, A., Ahmad, G., Haniff, J., Forecasting the incidence and prevalence of patients with end-stage renal disease in Malaysia up to the year 2040 (2017) Int.

Hence, a miniaturized satellite such as CanSat and CubeSat, is introduced. The invention of microelectronics has produced these satellites with most of the functionality of an OSCAR satellite, allowing a more cost-effective space research to be conducted. Generally, both CubeSat with a 10 cm cubesized, and CanSat with a size of soda can, have the subsystems consisting of power supply, payload, altitude determination and control system, communication system and on-board computer. Commonly, CubeSat is developed using off-the-shelf computer system which is expensive. As for the past few years, many researchers have tried developing CubeSat's onboard data handling (OBDH) system using Raspberry Pi, for its cheaper price, as its on-board computer in order to provide control for a more complicated space mission. With the implementation of Raspberry Pi as on-board computer, School of Aerospace Engineering plans to build a CubeSat to conduct research specifically on measuring electron density in the Ionosphere E-layer. Hence, this research project has produced a complete OBDH system with the ability to integrate with other related subsystems, as well as gather and store useful data which can be displayed on a web application for real-time monitoring and learning purpose. Besides, this web application is developed to provide a learning platform for all to ensure everyone have equal access to technical education to solve one of target in the Fourth Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). © 2020 IEEE.",CubeSat; internet of things; miniaturized satellite; on board data handling; online learning,Altitude control; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; E region; Interplanetary flight; Microelectronics; Small satellites; Space research; Spacecraft power supplies; Altitude determinations; Learning platform; Onboard computers; Onboard data handling; Real time monitoring; Space explorations; Technical educations; WEB application; Computer control systems,,,,,,,"Sabri, S.F., Yuhaniz, S.S., Kamardin, K., Designing a low cost cubesats command and data handling subsystem kit (2016) ARPN J.

We employ the subset of machine learning called deep learning to the real-time face recognition system as the deep face recognition technique has improved the state-of-the-art performance. This system uses a pre-trained model named FaceNet and employs triplet loss technique to impose a margin between every pair of faces from the same person to other faces. In other words, it minimizes the distance between the anchor and the positive from the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and the negative from different identity. Furthermore, to further investigate the performance of the system, we implement the Tensorflow framework to improve the system performance by the usage of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

The hybridization of the algorithm was conducted by incorporating Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to mitigate weaknesses in slow and premature convergence. In the proposed HIBS algorithm, the slow convergence of BFO algorithm was mitigated by using the random walk procedure of Firefly algorithm as an adaptive varying step size instead of using fixed step size. Concurrently, the local optima trap (i.e. premature convergence) of PSO algorithm was averted by using mutation operator. The HIBS algorithm was tested using benchmark functions and compared against classical BFO, PSO and other hybrid algorithms like Genetic Algorithm- Bacterial Foraging Optimization (GA-BFO), Genetic Algorithm- Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) and other BFO-PSO algorithms to prove its exploration and exploitation ability. It was observed from the experimental results that the EER values, after the influence of the proposed HIBS algorithm, dropped to 0.0070% and 0.0049% from 1.56% and 0.86% for the right and left hand images of the Bosphorus database, respectively.

Hand-based multibiometric system is the most successful and used in many real time systems especially law enforcement and forensics. Moreover, it is very user friendly and ease of use among all other biometric traits. Multi classifier fusion is the use of more classifiers for each modality involved rather than single at the score fusion of multibiometric system. Furthermore, hand-based multimodal biometrics can use either or all traits of fingerprint, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, dorsal vein, hand geometry, finger knuckle print and many more.

Adaptive step size is introduced instead of fixed step size by random walk of the Fire Fly Algorithm (FFA) in the tumble move of the bacterium at the chemo-taxis stage of BFO. So that, the slow convergence of the BFO algorithm is mitigated. PSO algorithm is acted as mutation operator to attain the global best. So, the trapping out in the local optima by PSO is being avoided. BFO algorithm is used to attain the local best optimality. The new algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark functions. The proposed hybrid algorithm is compared with the original BFO and PSO algorithm. It has been proved that the proposed algorithm shows the significance than the classical BFO and PSO algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adaptive step size; Bacterial foraging optimization; Fire fly algorithm; Particle swarm optimization,Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive step size; Bacterial foraging optimization; Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Bacterial swarm optimizations; Benchmark functions; Mutation operators; Optimization algorithms; Slow convergences; Optimization,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6313280,Acknowledgements.

Unfortunately, the awareness of early sign of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is still insufficiently provided to the public. Arm flapping is a good example of a stereotypical behavior of ASD early sign. Typically, a standard Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBSR) - set of questionnaire - used by clinicians for ASD diagnosis usually involved multiple and long sessions that apparently would delay and may have nonconformity. Thus, we aim to propose a computational framework to semi-automate the diagnosis process. We used human action recognition (HAR) algorithm. HAR involved in human body detection and the skeleton representation to show the arm asymmetrical in arm flapping movement which indicates the possibility of ASD signs by extracting the body pose into stickman model. The proposed framework has been tested against the video clips of children performing arm flapping behavior taken from public dataset. The outcome of this study is expected to detect early sign of ASD based on asymmetry measurement of arm flapping behavior. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Arm flapping; ASD early detection; Autism spectrum disorder; Body postures; HAR algorithm; Skeleton representation,Musculoskeletal system; Arm flapping; Asymmetry measurements; Autism spectrum disorders; Body postures; Computational framework; Human-action recognition; Skeleton representation; Stereotypical behavior; Diseases,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304/PKOMP/6313259",Acknowledgments.

To overcome these problems, a technique has been proposed to detect defects automatically and effectively using the image segmentation technique. Although, this technique has been well developed, it does suffer from several disadvantages of radiographic images taken to be poor in quality, as well as the microscopic size of the defects together with poor orientation relatively to the small size and thickness of the evaluated parts. Using image segmentation algorithm allows the defects to be automatically inspected and measured within the welded surface such as cracks, porosity and foreign inclusions, which may be weakening the welded parts. This paper proposes a system to automatically identifies and classifies the faults from the welding process by using the existing image segmentation algorithms. The output of the developed system produces a measured analysis which can be then used to describe the mechanical properties of welded part of the alloy such as its tensile and force. The benefits of this project will improve the welding process to reduce faults and defects for both constructing and manufacturing fields.",Automatic laser welding; Classification; Defect detection; Sobel-contour shape,,,,,,,,"Li, C.-T., Chiao, R., Multiresolution genetic clustering algorithm for texture segmentation (2003) Image and Vision Computing, 21 (11), pp. 955-966; Richardson, I.E., (2003) H.264 and MPEG-4 Video Compression: Video Coding for Next-generation Multimedia, , Wiley; Nejatpour, R., Sadabad, A.A., Automated weld defects detection using image processing and cad methods (2008) ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition; Parvati, K., Prakasa Rao, B.S., Mariya Das, M., Image segmentation using gray-scale morphology and marker-controlled watershed transformation (2008) Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, p. 8; Singh, K., Singh, A., A study of image segmentation algorithms for different types of images (2010) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science, (7), p. 5; Bala, A., An improved watershed image segmentation technique using matlab (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, (3), p. 6; Shen, J., (2012) Application of Image Segmentation In Inspection Of Welding-Practical research in MATLAB, , University Of Boras; Dass, R., Devi, P.S., Image segmentation techniques (2012) IJECT, 3 (1); Chaudhary, A., Gulati, T., Segmenting digital images using edge detection (2013) International Journal of Application of Innovation in Engineering & Management, 2 (5); (2013) WELDER'S Visual Inspection, pp. 32-33. , HANDBOOK; Narsimhachary, D., (2014) Effect of Laser Welding Parameters on 6061 Aluminium Alloy, , Department Of metallurgical And Materials Engineering, National Institute Of Technology Rourkela, Odisha-769008; Nand, G.K., Neogi, N.N., Defect detection of steel surface using entropy segmentation (2014) Annual IEEE India Conference, , Department of Electrical And Electronic Engineering, Birla Institute, Mesra, Ranchi-835215; Alam, M.A., Ali, M.M.N., Syed, M.A.A., Sorif, N., Rahaman, M.A., (2014) An Algorithm to Detect and Identify Defects of Industrial Pipes Using Image Processing, , Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), Chittagong, Bangladesh; Cogranne, R., Statistical detection of defects in radiographic images using an adaptive parametric model (2014) Signal Processing, 96 (8), pp. 173-189; Madani, S., Azizi, M., (2015) Detection of Weld Defects in Radiography Films Using Image Processing, (9); Che Jamil, M.S., Imam Fauzi, E.R., Juinn, C.S., Sheikh, M.A., Laser bending of pre-stressed thin-walled nickel microtubes (2015) Journal of Optics & Laser Technology, 73, pp. 105-117",,,,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,,,,,21801843,,,,English,J.
