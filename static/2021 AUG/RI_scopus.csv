One of the widely used assistive technologies is the tactile map that consists of Braille labeling and features annotation. The tactile map enables the visually impaired to understand the geographical information of a particular place. However, despite its wide usage, tactile map still lacks in its usability and availability especially in Malaysia. This paper aims to investigate the usability issues of tactile map, identify the requirements and proposed a conceptual prototype named TacTalk to overcome the usability issues of the existing tactile map. Interviews were conducted with the visually impaired at Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind in Penang. The results shows lack of information, misinterpretation, complexity, and hard to remember the map as the four main usability issues. Hence the proposed solution is named TacTalk, a 'talking tactile map' which consist of a tactile map with embedded buttons that will connect to TacTalk mobile application via Bluetooth to play the audio files once the button is pressed by the user. © 2017 IEEE.","assistive technology; navigation; Tactile map; visually impaired","Navigation; Usability engineering; Vision aids; Assistive technology; Audio files; Geographical information; Malaysia; Mobile applications; Tactile maps; Visually impaired; Maps",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6313219

The function of SCM in an ERP is to maintain manufacturing supply chain, which starts from input of data such as bill of material (BOM), planning, and procurement, right up to manufacturing management. BOM is an important input for supply chain management including Material Requirement Planning (MRP), which is one of ERP modules. This study is done at a multi-national company that has implemented ERP but having problems in inventory management on thousands of raw material and parts in production shop floor. Poor inventory management in production floor will cause excess or shortages of raw material which indirectly impact business performance of the company. Thus an additional module similar to MRP module is proposed to be implemented in the ERP to assist manufacturing department in inventory management to eliminate manual inventory management. This extended module is expected to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of manufacturing productions in managing inventory. © 2017 IEEE.","Bill of Material (BOM); Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Inventory management; Material Requirement Planning (MRP); Production shop floor","Enterprise resource management; Floors; Information systems; Inventory control; Management information systems; Manufacture; Metadata; Resource allocation; Supply chain management; Bill of materials; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Inventory management; Material requirement planning; Production shops; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/814254","The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting the publication of this paper through USM Research University Grant scheme 1001/PKOMP/814254.

In the literature, low health literacy and negative health attitude are the two main causal factors for high number of lifestyle disease. Meanwhile, mobile health or better known as mHealth is found to enhance health literacy and encourage positive health attitude. This study aims to find the relationship between health literacy, health attitude and lifestyle disease for residence in Malaysia. A total of 150 responses have been collected using a questionnaire posted via social media platforms. The findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between health literacy and lifestyle disease as well as health attitude and lifestyle disease. Majority of the respondents have been found to have low health literacy and negative health attitude too. A mHealth application with features of disease information, symptoms checker, calorie counter, medication information and exercise can be proposed with hope to improve health literacy and attitude of Malaysia residence.

A preliminary study was done to explore the state of OSS implementation among government agencies since the launch of the Malaysian Public Sector OSS Master Plan on July 16, 2004. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions were conducted with IT managers and IT officers in the Northern Region of Peninsular Malaysia. The preliminary study aimed at investigating the usage of OSS and proprietary software, the level of OSS utilisation, the level of OSS knowledge and training of ICT and non-ICT staff, software development and acquisition model, internal OSS manpower capabilities and skills, the user's perception of the advantages of OSS, the user's perception of the risks of OSS, and the problems or barriers in OSS implementation. The results of interviews show that there are many problems or barriers in OSS implementation, e.g. lack of internal OSS expertise, lack of OSS policy, and lack of top management support. Therefore, this study will test the hypotheses on the success factors to OSS implementation in the public sector and to propose a framework for successful OSS implementation in the Malaysian Public Sector. A quantitative approach using survey method via questionnaire will be performed to answer the research question where simple random sampling will be used. The target respondents are the IT managers and IT officers among the sampling frame of 192 public sector agencies in Malaysia that have successfully implemented at least three OSS solution areas. © 2016 IEEE.","Malaysian Public Sector OSS Master Plan; Open Source Software (OSS); OSS solution areas; simple random sampling; successful OSS implementation","Computer software; Managers; Open systems; Personnel training; Risk perception; Software design; Software engineering; Surveys; Face-to-face interview; Malaysian public sectors; Master plan; OSS solution areas; Simple random sampling; Software development and acquisitions; successful OSS implementation; Top management support; Open source software",,,,,,,"Varian, H.R., Shapiro, C., Linux adoption in the public sector: An economic analysis (2003) Manuscript, , University of California, Berkeley; Rossi, B., Russo, B., Succi, G., Adoption of free/libre open source software in public organizations: Factors of impact (2012) Information Technology & People, 25 (2), p. 156. , May; Maldonado, E., The process of introducing floss in the public administration: The case of Venezuela (2010) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 11 (11), pp. 756-783. , Nov; Kamau, J., Namuye, S., A review of users adoption of open source software in Africa (2012) Computer and Information Science, 5 (5), p. 45; (2010) Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Programme Phase II Benefit Realisation Report (BRR), , MAMPU; Thomas, J., Jr., Open source software: An enabler of Malaysia's vision 2020 transformation (2010) EDITORIAL COMMITTEE, p. 40; Harian, B., OSS Jimat Perbelanjaan Kerajaan RM370j, , http://www2.bharian.com.my/articles/OSSjimatperbelanjaankerajaanRM370j/Article/, 16-Jul-2013[Accessed: 10-Jun-2015]; Open source system proves effective in public sector New Straits Times, , http://www2.nst.com.my/nation/general/open-source-system-proveseffective-in-public-sector-1.320195, 16-Jul-2013[Accessed: 15-Aug-2015]; OSS Adoption Statistics (Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Programme), , MAMPU, 06-Dec-2010; Haider, A., (2008) Open Source Software Utilization in Australian State Governments; Haider, A., Koronios, A., Promises of open source software for australian government agencies-an exploratory study (2009) PACIS 2009 Proceedings, p. 16; Jayawardena, S., Dias, G., Free and open source software for public sector enterprise applications in Sri Lanka (2011) International Conference on Information Management and Evaluation, pp. 239-249; Johnston, K., Begg, S., Tanner, M., Exploring the factors influencing the adoption of Open Source Software in Western Cape schools (2013) International Journal of Education & Development Using Information & Communication Technology, 9 (2), pp. 64-84. , Mar; Mtsweni, J., Biermann, E., An investigation into the implementation of open source software within the SA government: An emerging expansion model (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 Annual Research Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT Research in Developing Countries: Riding the Wave of Technology, pp. 148-158; Mutula, S., Kalaote, T., Open source software deployment in the public sector: A review of Botswana and South Africa (2010) Library Hi Tech, 28 (1), pp. 63-80. , Mar; Oram, A., Promoting open source software in government: The challenges of motivation and follow-through (2011) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 8 (3), pp. 240-252. , Jun; Richter, D., Zo, H., Maruschke, M., A comparative analysis of open source software usage in Germany, Brazil, and India (2009) Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology, 2009.

However, ERP systems often fail to live up their claim to improve operational efficiency and strategic effectiveness due to misfits between the standard-built ERP systems and the adopting organizations. Anecdotal evidences from subjective studies suggest modification of ERP systems and adaptation of organizational structure could mitigate the misfits between ERP systems and the adopting organizations. Nevertheless, empirical and rigorous studies capable of proving these conjectures are scarce. The purpose of this chapter is to empirically validate and examine: 1) the negative impacts of the misfits between ERP systems and organizations and 2) to what extent the two misfitreduction strategies, namely system modification and organizational adaptation, are able to mitigate the impacts of these misfits. The Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model is adapted as the theoretical framework of this study capable of incorporating moderating variables. Three-hundred-and-five sets of questionnaires collected from ERP systems users in the manufacturing sector of Malaysia were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. Findings of this study indicate that different types of misfits, namely input misfit, process misfit, and output misfit, have different impacts on ERP systems performances. More importantly, this study found that the appropriateness of misfit-reduction strategies is contingent to the types of ERP misfits. Precisely, system modification can effectively mitigate input and process misfits, while organizational adaptation can be used to counteract input and output misfits. © 2014, IGI Global.

Not only it is able to facilitate two-way communication between physician and patient, but it is also useful for the caregivers to maximize efficiency in running daily activities. Managing ischemia heart disease, one of the deadly diseases, would definitely benefit from such ubiquitous healthcare system. The current treatment method for ischemia requires patients to be physically present at their respective treatment centres for regular monitoring. This increases the need for remote monitoring method, due to the urgent nature of treating ischemia heart attack. Therefore, this paper presents preliminary system architecture and feasibility study of HeartPals, a low-cost Android-based integrated wearable electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring system that enables ischemia patients to be remotely monitored by their physicians. We also propose TOFUSER, a Technology-Oriented Feasibility stUdy Scheme for End-useRs as an extended feasibility study scheme to allow users to verify the preliminary requirements of the technology and users' requirements of HeartPals. © 2013 The Authors.","Android Devices; ECG Monitoring System; Feasiblity Study; Healthcare; Physiological Signal Device",,,,,,,,"(2008) Heart Disease on the Rise, Second Leading Killer, , http://www.malaysianheart.org/article.phpAid=35, 01/05/12; (2002) The Impact of Chronic Diseases in Malaysia, , http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/media/impact/malaysia.pdf, Facing the Fact 02/05/12; Stefan, G., Patrick, K., Clemens, L., Bjoern, L., (2012) Real-time ECG Monitoring and Arrhythmia Detection Using Android-based Devices, , http://www5.informatik.uni-Erlangen.de/Forschung/Publikationen/2012/ Gradl12-REM.pdf, 05/04/2013; Silva, I., Moody, G.B., Celli, Improving the quality of ECGs collected using mobile phones: The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2011 (2011) Computing in Cardiology, 38 (1), pp. 273-276; (2011) Quasar: Sensing a World of Potential, , http://www.quasarusa.com/, 03/05/12; (2013) AliveCor: ECG Screening Made Easy, , http://www.alivecor.com, 04/05/2013; (2013) New Element Medical: High Technology Medical Solution, , http://NewElementMedical.co, 04/05/2013; (2002) MobileHealth: Innovative GPRS/UMTS Mobile Services Applications in Healthcare, , http://www.mobihealth.org/, 01/04/2013; Viswanathan, Whangbo, Yang, (2010) Data Mining in Ubiquitous Healthcare: New Fundamentals Technology in Data Mining, , Kimito Funatsu (Eds.); InTech Press; 2010; Avison, D.E., Fitzgerald, G., (2006) Information System Development: Methodologies, Techniques and Tools, , 4th rev. edition; New York: McGraw-Hill; Novak, T.P., Hoffman, D.L., Yung, Measuring the customer experience in online environments: A structural modelling approach (2000) Marketing Science, 19 (1), pp. 22-44. , Winter; Anderson, Presenting and evaluating qualitative research (2010) American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education Marketing Science, 74 (8). , PMC","Idrus, R.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 USM, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia; email: rosnah@cs.usm.my",,"","Elsevier B.V.","4th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks, EUSPN 2013 and the 3rd International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare, ICTH 2013","21 October 2013 through 24 October 2013","Niagara Falls, ON",103379,18770509,,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

Modification of the ERP system and adaptation of business processes have been hyped as the means to reduce misfits between ERP system and business organizations. Nevertheless, to date, very little empirical evidence exists to demonstrate that the potential has indeed been realized. Thus, the purpose of this study is to empirically examine to which extent the two misfit-reduction strategies, namely system modification and organizational adaptation mitigate the negative impacts of ERP misfits on ERP system performance, which is measured by information quality in this study. A total amount of 305 sets of questionnaire that collected from the ERP system users in manufacturing sector in Malaysia were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. The findings of this study have revealed that the effects of the two misfit-reduction strategies vary based on the different characteristic of ERP misfits. Specifically, system modification is found to significantly reduce the negative impacts of deep-structure misfit such as process misfit, whereas organization adaptation is significant in mitigating surface-structure misfit such as data presentation and layout.

Hence, it is vital to have a better understanding of the system-context misfit problem. Nevertheless, limited studies have empirically examined the relationship between the misfit and the system outcome, especially at the dimensional level of the variables. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a Misfit-Inviability Model (MIM) to conceptualize of relationships between MRPII misfit, extent of organizational readiness, and MRPII system outcome, at the dimensional level of each variable and grounded on strong theoretical foundations. The MIM is an enhancement of existing Fit-Viability Model (FVM). In terms of implication, the new model manages to represent the system adoption as a dynamic process over time, by incorporating implementation contingencies. Additionally, the framework serves as a general model that can be adapted to assess the relationship between outcome of various information systems and the misfits. Future research may include more testing and validation of the dimensions and constructs used in the model.","Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Fit-viability model (FVM); Manufacturing environment; Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRPII); Production planning system; System implementation contingencies; System-context misfit","Fit-viability model (FVM); Manufacturing environment; Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRPII); Production planning system; System implementation; System-context misfit; Enterprise resource planning; Production control; Resource allocation; Technology; Manufacture",,,,,,,"Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Software-driven changes to business processes: An empirical study of impacts of enterprise resource planning (Erp) systems at the local level (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40, pp. 4799-4814; Juntao, G., Li, Z., Detecting gaps between erp software and organizational needs: A semantic similarity based approach (2008) IEEE International Workshop on Semantic Computing and Systems, pp. 21-26; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Understanding the local-level costs and benefits of erp through organizational information processing theory (2004) Journal of Information & Management, 41, pp. 431-443; Chen, H.-H., Road, Z.N., Chen, S.-C., A study of successful erp - From the organization fit perspective (2009) Journal of Systemics, Cybernatics, and Informatics, 7, pp. 8-16; Gao, J., Zhang, L., Wang, Z., Decision support for handling gaps between erp functionalities and organizational needs: A goal reasoning based approach (2008) 2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, pp. 255-258; Hawari, A.A., Heeks, R., Explaining erp failure in a developing country: A jordanian case study (2010) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 23, pp. 135-160; Sia, S.K., Soh, C., An assessment of package-organisation misalignment: Institutional and ontological structures (2007) European Journal of Information Systems, 16, pp. 568-583; Brehm, L., Heinzl, A., Markus, M., (2001) Tailoring Erp Systems: A Spectrum of Choices and their Implications, 8, p. 8017. , ed: IEEE Computer Society; Liang, T.-P., Huang, C.-W., Yeh, Y.-H., Lin, B., Adoption of mobile technology in business: A fit-viability model (2007) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 107, pp. 1154-1169; Hong, K., Kim, Y., The critical success factors for erp implementation: An organizational fit perspective (2002) Journal of Information & Management, 40, pp. 25-40; Brehm, L., Heinzl, A., Markus, M.L., Tailoring erp systems: A spectrum of choices and their implications (2001) Proceedings of the 34th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 49, p. 9; Rolland, C., Exploring the fitness relationship between system functionality and business needs (2009) Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-year Perspective, pp. 305-326; Liang, H., Xue, Y., Coping with erp-related contextual issues in smes: A vendor's perspective (2004) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13, pp. 399-415; Delone, W.H., McLean, E.R., The delone and mclean model of information systems success: A ten-year update (2003) J.

Furthermore, disputations upon whether organizational adaptation is always superseding other misfit resolving strategies have increasingly exposed. Hence, this paper presents an operational framework - taxonomy model of MRPII misfit to be applied in a case study which involves three small and medium manufacturing organizations in Malaysia, with the purpose of systematically classify MRPII misfits, and subsequently to identify appropriate misfit resolving strategy (system modification or organization adaptation) based on the specificity of the misfit. The implications of each type of MRPII misfit have been discussed from the perspectives of degree of misfit severity, risk of the MRPII system, organizational discretion on structural change, and most importantly the misfit resolving strategy. In addition, the planned methodology of the case study is presented, in details of selection of case companies and data analysis method. The findings of this proposed study is expected to serve as general guidelines or basics that can be referred by adopting organization to build their resolving strategy, according to the specificity of MRPII misfit situation which they encountered.","Case study; Institutional theory; Manufacturing environment; Manufacturing resource planning (MRPII); Misfit; Ontology","Data analysis methods; Institutional theory; Malaysia; Malaysians; Manufacturing environment; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing organizations; Manufacturing resource planning; Manufacturing resource planning (MRPII); Misfit; Operational performance; Organizational adaptation; Small and medium enterprise; Strategic advantages; Structural change; Structural misfits; System modifications; Industry; Ontology; Research; Resource allocation; Taxonomies; Technology; Manufacture",,,,,,,"Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Software-driven changes to business processes: An empirical study of impacts of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at the local level (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40, pp. 4799-4814; Rolland, C., Prakash, N., Matching ERP system functionality to customer requirements (2001) Fifth IEEE International Symposium on Requirements Engineering, pp. 66-75; Juntao, G., Li, Z., Detecting gaps between ERP software and organizational needs: A semantic similarity based approach (2008) IEEE International Workshop on Semantic Computing and Systems, pp. 21-26; Shehab, E.M., Sharp, M.W., Supramaniam, L., Spedding, T.A., Enterprise resource planning: An integrative review (2004) Business Process Management Journal, 10, pp. 359-386; Sia, S.K., Soh, C., An assessment of package-organisation misalignment: Institutional and ontological structures (2007) European Journal of Information Systems, 16, pp. 568-583; Brehm, L., Heinzl, A., Markus, M.L., Tailoring ERP systems: A spectrum of choices and their implications (2001) Proceedings of the 34th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 49, p. 9; Liang, H., Xue, Y., Coping with ERP-related contextual issues in SMEs: A vendor's perspective (2004) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13, pp. 399-415; Swan, J., Newell, S., Robertson, M., The illusion of 'best practice' in information systems for operations management (1999) European Journal of Information System, 8, pp. 284-293; Hawari, A.A., Heeks, R., Explaining ERP failure in a developing country: A jordanian case study (2010) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 23, pp. 135-160; MacCarthy, B.L., Fernandes, F.C.F., A multi-dimensional classification of production systems for the design and selection of production planning and control systems (2000) Production Planning & Control: The Management of Operations, 11, pp. 481-496; Mignerat, M., Rivard, S., Positioning the institutional perspective in information systems research (2009) J Inf Technol, 24, pp. 369-391; Soh, C., Sia, S.K., An institutional perspective on sources of ERP package-organisation misalignments (2004) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13, pp. 375-397; Wand, Y., Weber, R., On the deep structure of information systems (1995) Information Systems Journal, 5, pp. 203-223","Tan, S.-Y.; School of Computer Sciences, , Penang, Malaysia; email: tsy09_com036@student.usm.my",,"Singapore Institute of Electronics",,"2011 International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Technology, ICMST 2011","16 September 2011 through 18 September 2011","Singapore",87754,10226680,9783037852958,,,"English","Adv.

ERP is more than a software package; it includes the efforts and activities to integrate internal and external management information, business process automation and reengineering, and organisation structure streamlining. Thus, ERP eventually leads to an efficient and competitive business. Despite the prominence of ERP systems, approximately three-quarters of ERP projects are deemed as failures. Most failures are attributed to the misfit between pre-loaded business models in the ERP system and business requirements in the real world. This paper introduces a framework to classify ERP misfits into logical categories that provide insights for solution derivation. Subsequently, the classification methods are applied to a case study. Practitioners can use the misfit classification method to derive corresponding actions as solutions for ERP misfits based on their nature or specificity. In addition, the theoretical contribution of the ERP misfit problem is explored to provide information for researchers to determine appropriate theories and concepts explaining this domain. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Business information system; Business strategies and processes; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); ERP implementation problems; Misalignment; Misfits",,,,,,,,"Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120. , doi: 10.1177/014920639101700108; Brehm, L., Heinzl, A., Markus, M.L., Tailoring ERP systems: A spectrum of choices and their implications (2001) Paper Presented at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, , Maui, Hawaii; Bryman, A., (1988) Quantity and Quality in Social Research By Alan Bryman, , London: Unwin Hyman; Calisir, F., Calisir, F., The relation of interface usability characteristics, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use to end-user satisfaction with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (2004) Computers in Human Behavior, 20 (4), pp. 505-515; Chen, H.-H., Road, Z.N., Chen, S.-C., A study of successful ERP - from the organization fit perspective (2009) Journal of Systemics, Cybernatics, and Informatics, 7 (4), pp. 8-16; Das, A., Narasimhan, R., Process-technology fit and its implications for manufacturing performance (2001) Journal of Operations Management, 19, pp. 521-540; Davenport, T.H., Putting the enterprise into the enterprise system (1998) Harvard Business Review, 76, pp. 121-131; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Understanding the plant level costs and benefits of ERP: Will the ugly duckling always turn into a swan (2000) Paper Presented at the Proceedings of 33rd International Conference on System Sciences, , Hawaii; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Software-driven changes to business processes: An empirical study of impacts of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at the local level (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40, pp. 4799-4814; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Understanding the local-level costs and benefits of ERP through organizational information processing theory (2004) Journal of Information & Management, 41, pp. 431-443; Gribbins, M.L., Subramaniam, C., Shaw, M.J., Process-technology fit: Extending task-technology fit to assess enterprise information technologies (2006) Paper Presented at the 27th International Conference on Information Systems, , Milwaukee; Gupta, M., Kohli, A., Enterprise resource planning systems and its implications for operations function (2006) Technovation, 26 (5-6), pp. 687-696; Guttridge, A.D.P., Dani, S., Burns, N., Investigating factors affecting ERP selection in made-to-order SME sector (2008) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 19 (4), pp. 430-446. , doi: 10.1108/17410380810869905; Holsapple, C.W., Wang, Y.M., Wu, J.H., Empirically testing user characteristics and fitness factors in enterprise resource planning success (2006) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 19, pp. 323-342; Hong, K., Kim, Y., The critical success factors for ERP implementation: An organizational fit perspective (2002) Journal of Information & Management, 40, pp. 25-40; Koh, S.C.L., Saad, S.M., Managing uncertainty in ERP-controlled manufacturing environments in SMEs (2006) International Journal of Production Economics, 101 (1), pp. 109-127; Leary, D.E.O., Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems: An empirical analysis of benefits (2005) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, 2, pp. 63-72; Madapusi, A., Derrick, D.S., Aligning ERP systems with international strategies (2003) Information Systems Management, 22 (1), pp. 7-17; Mignerat, M., Rivard, S., Positioning the institutional perspective in information systems research (2009) Journal of Information Technology, 24 (4), pp. 369-391; Moon, Y.B., Enterprise resource planning (ERP): A review of the literature (2007) International Journal of Management and Enterprise Development, 4 (3), pp. 235-264; Morton, N.A., Hu, Q., Implications of the fit between organizational structure and ERP: A structural contingency theory perspective (2008) International Journal of Information Management, 28, pp. 391-402; Olsen, K.A., Sætre, P., IT for niche companies: Is an ERP system the solution?

The impacts are analyzed from the perspectives of operational performance, data quality, and social aspect of users. Participant observation has been conducted for duration of 3 months to collect relevant information on the issue. The findings indicate that human negligence and cumbersome procedure potentially lead to the violation of data integrity. Apart of that, the findings also implies that ERP context influences user by imposing constraints to agility and flexibility of tasks, impedes labor productivity by imposing considerable amount of manual tasks, and reduces social interactions of users. The study provides insight into interrelationships between user behavior, business policies, and ERP-controlled environment which invoke awareness of practitioners on problems that might detract the ERP adoption. In addition, this study provides the foundation for further investigation in post-implementation phase of ERP, such as the social-psychological impacts of ERP context on endusers, interactions of operational-level activities with ERP context, and trainings and education on larger scope of ERP context rather than ERP system training. © 2010 IADIS.","Enterprise resource planning (ERP); ERP postimplementation; Organizational behavior; Organizational impacts; User behavior","Business policies; Data integrity; Data quality; End-users; ERP adoption; ERP system; Exploratory studies; Human negligence; Labor productivity; Operational performance; Organizational behavior; Organizational impacts; Participant observations; Post-implementation; Social interactions; User behaviors; Behavioral research; Information systems; Social aspects; Enterprise resource planning",,,,,,,"Calisir, F., The relation of interface usability characteristics, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use to end-user satisfaction with enterprise resource planning systems (2004) Computers in Human Behavior, 20, pp. 505-515; Chang, M.K., Understanding ERP system adoption from the user's perspective (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 113, pp. 928-942; Gelderman, M., The relation between user satisfaction, usage of information systems and performance (1998) Information and Management, 34 (1), pp. 11-18. , PII S0378720698000445; Gattiker, T.F., Goodhue, D.L., Software-driven changes to business processes: An empirical study of impacts of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at the local level (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40 (18), pp. 4799-4814; Haag, S., (2007) Management Information Systems for the Information Age, , McGraw-Hill, United Sates; Holsapple, C.W., Wang, Y.-M., Wu, J.-H., Empirically testing user characteristics and fitness factors in enterprise resource planning success (2005) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 19 (3), pp. 323-342. , DOI 10.1207/s15327590ijhc1903-3; Jonsson, P., Exploring problems related to the materials planning user environment (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 113 (1), pp. 383-400. , DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2007.04.015, PII S0925527307002964; Kemp, E., Observing practice as participant observation: Linking theory to practice (2001) Social Work Education, 20 (5), pp. 527-538; Koh, S.C.L., Simpson, M., Change and uncertainty in SME manufacturing environments using ERP (2005) Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 16 (6), pp. 629-653. , DOI 10.1108/17410380510609483; Larsen, T.J., A multilevel explanation of end-user computing satisfaction with an enterprise resource planning system within an international manufacturing organization (2009) Computer in Industry, p. 12; Moon, Y.B., Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): A review of the literature (2007) International Journal of Management and Enterprise Development, 4 (3), pp. 235-264; Shehab, E.M., Enterprise resource planning: An integrative review (2004) Business Process Management Journal, 10 (4), pp. 359-386; Spathis, C., Constantinides, S., The usefulness of ERP systems for effective management (2003) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 103 (9), pp. 677-685; Somers, T.M., Nelson, K., Karimi, J., Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the End-User Computing Satisfaction Instrument: Replication within an ERP Domain (2003) Decision Sciences, 34 (3), pp. 595-621. , DOI 10.1111/j.1540-5414.2003.02428.x; Wu, J.H., Wang, Y.M., Measuring ERP success: The ultimate users' view (2006) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 26 (8), pp. 882-903","Tan, S.-Y.; School of Computer Sciences, , Penang, Malaysia",,,,"IADIS International Conference Information Systems 2010","18 March 2010 through 20 March 2010","Porto",89579,,9789728939090,,,"English","Proc.

The tool or method used in this scenario is known as pull-technology. As a solution, this study proposed an online shopping widget which automatically retrieves relevant online information from various sources at single point of time based on the concept of push technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate the acceptance level of the proposed online shopping widget among Malaysian, through applying technology acceptance theory in questionnaire survey method. The findings of this study imply that the overall acceptance level of Malaysian toward the proposed online shopping widget is considered as low. In addition, the result of this study also suggested that perceived usefulness of the sidebar widget is the strongest antecedent which lead to the intention of use of the online shopping widget.

An integration of a primary technology that effectively utilizes an ICT system in the organization such as ERP system will have a huge positive long-term result on any large, medium or small enterprises. However, most Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia are still lagging behind. This paper aims to discuss the proposed pre-considered factors affecting ERP system adoption in Malaysian SMEs by using a technology-organization- environment (TOE) framework. Based on this framework, each factor will be looked at and discussed further in this paper on how the elements in the framework affect the adoption of ERP system in SMEs. This paper also explains how the factors will be used in a survey to be conducted later.

The tool or method used in this scenario is known as pull-technology. As a solution, this study proposed an online shopping widget which automatically retrieves relevant online shopping information from various sources at single point of time based on the concept of push technology. In relevant to this, the objective of this paper is to investigate the acceptance level of the proposed online shopping widget among Malaysians, through applying technology acceptance theory in questionnaire survey. The findings of this study imply that the overall acceptance level of alaysians toward the proposed online shopping widget is considered as relatively low. In addition, the result of this study also suggested that perceived usefulness of the sidebar widget is the strongest antecedent which led to the intention of use of the online shopping widget. This study has provided a foundation to both practitioners (e.g. software developers) and academicians for understanding of the acceptance level of similar push technology-based online shopping widget, and the characteristics the online shopping widget (especially usefulness and ease-of-use) should incorporated in order to enhance acceptance level among prospective users.","Online shopping; Push technology; Sidebar widget; Technology acceptance theory",,,,,,,,"(2008) E-payments Gaining Popularity, , http://startechcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file=/2008/1/1/technology/19850887&sec=technology, 27 November, Available:; Pastore, M., (2000) Online Consumer Spending Growth Slowing, , http://cyberatlas.internet.com/markets/retailing/article/0,6061_271961,00.html, Available:; Watabe, K., Iwasaki, K., Factors Affecting Consumer Decisions About Purchases At Online Shops and Stores (2007), p. 88; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new technologies?

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system can be one of the tools to increase their effectiveness and competitiveness in global market. The aim of an ERP system is to improve the efficiency of the whole business operations in an organization and increase the optimal returns. Most SMEs cannot afford to adopt an existing ERP system due to the extremely high cost and complex implementation of the system. This paper will discuss the future market for SMEs in Malaysia, the issues in adopting ERP and the requirement and characteristic of the ERP system in Malaysian SMEs.
