However, despite the enormous quantity of tweets regarding online retailing, we know little about customers’ perceptions regarding the products and services offered by online retail brands. Therefore, this study focuses on analysing brand-related tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers during the most important sales period of the year, covering Black Friday, Christmas and the New Year's sales events. We explore trends in customer tweets by utilising a combination of data analytics approaches including time series analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modelling to analyse the trends of tweet volume and sentiment and to understand the reasons underlying changes in sentiment. Through the sentiment and time series analyses, we identify several critical time points that lead to significant deviations in sentiment trends. We then use a topic modelling approach to examine the tweets in the period leading up to and following these critical moments to understand what exactly drives these changes in sentiment. The study provides a deeper understanding of online retailing customer behaviour and derives significant managerial insights that are useful for improving online retailing service provision. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; Online retailing; Service provision; Social media; Time series","Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Harmonic analysis; Sales; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Time series; Critical moment; Current events; Customer behaviour; Online retailing; Online retails; Products and services; Service provisions; Social media; Time series analysis; article; big data; human; social media; time series analysis",,,,,,"This research is partially funded by the Government of Malaysia .",,"Archak, N., Ghose, A., Ipeirotis, P.G., Deriving the pricing power of product features by mining consumer reviews (2011) Management Science, 57 (8), pp. 1485-1509; Arias, M., Arratia, A., Xuriguera, R., Forecasting with twitter data (2013) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 5 (1), pp. 1-24; Bendle, N.T., Wang, X., Uncovering the message from the mess of big data (2016) Business Horizons, 59 (1), pp. 115-124; Bian, J., Yoshigoe, K., Hicks, A., Yuan, J., He, Z., Xie, M., Modave, F., Mining Twitter to assess the public perception of the “internet of things” (2016) PLoS One, 11 (7); Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), p. 77; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Cheung, C.M.K., Lee, M.K.O., Rabjohn, N., The impact of electronic word‐of‐mouth (2008) Internet Research, 18 (3), pp. 229-247; Clemes, M.D., Gan, C., Zhang, J., An empirical analysis of online shopping adoption in Beijing, China (2014) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 21 (3), pp. 364-375; Collier, J.E., Bienstock, C.C., How do customers judge quality in an E-tailer?

This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance. The study offers a novel approach of transforming social media data into useful knowledge about online retailing. The incorporation of three analytical approaches offers insights for researchers to understand the hidden content behind the large collections of unstructured bodies of text, and this information can be used to improve online retailing services and reach out to customers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Online retailing; Sentiment analysis; Social media research; Text analytics; Topic modelling","Data mining; Metadata; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Analytical approach; Business performance; Negative customers; Online retailing; Products and services; Service improvement; Social media; Text analytics; Sales",,,,,"Newton Fund

It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers’ engagement with the online brand communities on users’ perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers. Our findings indicate that the level, length, type and attitude of retailers’ engagement with social media users have a significant impact on their sentiments. Based on our results, we derived several important managerial and practical implications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Engagement; Microblogging; Online community; Online retailing; Social media","Electronic commerce; Online systems; Sales; Engagement; Microblogging; On-line communities; Online retailing; Social media; Social networking (online); human; perception; social media",,,,,,,,"Arakawa, Y., Kameda, A., Aizawa, A., Suzuki, T., Adding Twitter-specific features to stylistic features for classifying tweets by user type and number of retweets (2014) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 65 (7), pp. 1416-1423; Armstrong, A., Hagel, J., The real value of online communities (2000) Knowledge and communities, pp. 85-95; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., Predicting the future with social media (2010) Paper presented at the international conference on web intelligence and intelligent agent technology (WI-IAT), IEEE/WIC/ACM; Bae, Y., Lee, H., Sentiment analysis of twitter audiences: Measuring the positive or negative influence of popular twitterers (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (12), pp. 2521-2535; Balaji, M.S., Jha, S., Royne, M.B., Customer e-complaining behaviours using social media (2015) The Service Industries Journal, 35 (11-12), pp. 633-654; Barnaghi, P., Breslin, J.G., Ghaffari, P., Opinion mining and sentiment polarity on twitter and correlation between events and sentiment (2016) Paper presented at the 2nd IEEE international conference on big data computing service and applications, Oxford, United Kingdom; Bernstein, F., Song, J.-S., Zheng, X., “Bricks-and-mortar” vs. “clicks-and-mortar”: An equilibrium analysis (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 187 (3), pp. 671-690; Beykikhoshk, A., Arandjelović, O., Phung, D., Venkatesh, S., Caelli, T., Using Twitter to learn about the autism community (2015) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 5 (1); Boyd, D., Golder, S., Lotan, G., Tweet, tweet, Retweet: Conversational aspects of retweeting on twitter (2010) Paper presented at the proceedings of the 43rd Hawaii international conference on system sciences; Brodie, R.J., Ilic, A., Juric, B., Hollebeek, L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis (2013) Journal of Business Research, 66 (1), pp. 105-114; Brown, T.J., Barry, T.E., Dacin, P.A., Gunst, R.F., Spreading the word: Investigating antecedents of consumers’ positive word-of-mouth intentions and behaviors in a retailing context (2005) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33 (2), pp. 123-138; Cambra-Fierro, J., Melero-Polo, I., Javier Sese, F., Can complaint-handling efforts promote customer engagement?

The news is about Philae, a robotic lander from the European Space Agency (ESA), which successfully made the first-ever rendezvous and touchdown of its kind on a comet nucleus on November 12, 2014. In order to understand how Twitter is practically used in spreading messages on historical events, we conducted an analysis of one-week of tweet feeds that contain the #CometLanding hashtag. We studied the trends of tweets, the diffusion of the information and the characteristics of the social network created. The results indicated that the use of Twitter as a platform enables online communities to engage and spread the historic event through social media network (e.g. tweets, retweets, mentions and replies). In addition, it was found that comprehensible and understandable hashtags could influence users to follow the same tweet stream compared to other laborious hashtags that were difficult to understand on social media. © 2017 IEEE.","Diffusion of information; Hashtag; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"(2014) ""Tagboard.Com Website."", , Web; Aharony, N., Twitter Use by Three Political Leaders: An Exploratory Analysis (2012) Online Information Review, 36 (4), pp. 587-603; Arakawa, Y., Adding Twitter-Specific Features to Stylistic Features for Classifying Tweets by User Type and Number of Retweets (2014) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 65 (7), pp. 1416-1423; Boyd, D., Golder, S., Lotan, G., Tweet, Tweet, Retweet: Conversational Aspects of Retweeting on Twitter Proceedings of the 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 2010.

Social media covers a wide spectrum of users and facilitates businesses in their operations by providing various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of social media content is created and freely available on social media sites. In order to understand customers better, companies use this opportunity to monitor and analyse user-generated content related to their interactions, performances and at the same time provide comprehensive views on other competitors. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform social media analysis and transform the data into meaningful knowledge, this paper examines user-generated unstructured content on Twitter and Facebook sites of the three leading UK online retailers: Amazon, Asda and Tesco. Our analysis shows how topics, engagement, sentiment analysis of these data could be turn into knowledge, source of intelligence and useful for companies to improve businesses. We believe that the study of customer behaviours and interactions on social media site has its potential to extract valuable knowledge and pattern that can be beneficial to develop effective marketing strategies.

As a result, all these data and information can be easily or exclusively found on the Internet by the public. However, little is known yet about how to turn this data into useful knowledge and the collection of the data has not been sufficiently researched, especially in the online retail industry. In an effort to help companies in the online retail industry to utilise the data, this paper explores social network-generated contents on Twitter sites through topics identification that can subsequently facilitate companies to improve their services and performances. This paper describes a study based on data gathered on the Twitter sites of the leading UK retailers: Amazon, Argos and Tesco, during the periods of Black Friday, Boxing Day and Christmas in the UK. We chose Twitter as a platform because, whilst other previous works addressed online reviews and website contents in their studies, microblogs are just starting to be explored due to their characters' limitations and informal content making it harder to interpret. In this paper, we infer topics from short-Text tweets posted by customers mentioning brand names by employing a machine learning approach. We then analyse the tweets to determine the primary issues or topics focused by customers regarding these online retail brands by interpreting the themes of the specific keywords set represented. The topics which emerge based on the collection of tweet posts contribute to various aspects of companies' operations, such as delivery, customer service and product performance. We believe that this study derives some implications and insights for online retail brand companies in improving their service provisions, especially in customer service management. Insights on such topics can be beneficial in numerous ways, such as marketing, innovation and public image.","Data Mining; Machine Learning; Online Retailing; Social Media; Topic Model; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Data mining; E-learning; Information management; Information systems; Learning systems; Sales; Websites; Machine learning; Service industry; Turing machines; Customer service management; Machine learning approaches; Online retailing; Social media; Social media networks; Topic Modeling; Topics identifications; Twitter; Data and information; Product performance; Service provisions; Web site contents; Social networking (online)",,,,,,"Supported by the University of Bristol Alumni Foundation and the Government of Malaysia.",,"Abbasi, A., Chen, H., Thoms, S., Fu, T., Affect analysis of web forums and blogs using correlation ensembles (2008) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 20 (9), pp. 1168-1180; Berthon, P.R., Pitt, L.F., Plangger, K., Shapiro, D., Marketing meets Web 2.0, social media, and creative consumers: Implications for international marketing strategy (2012) Business Horizons, 55 (3), pp. 261-271; Beykikhoshk, A., Arandjelovi, O., Phung, D., Venkatesh, S., Caelli, T., Using Twitter to learn about the autism community (2015) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 5 (1); Bian, J., Yoshigoe, K., Hicks, A., Yuan, J., He, Z., Xie, M., Modave, M.F., Mining Twitter to Assess the Public Perception of the ""internet of Things"" (2016) PLoS One, 11 (7); Blackshaw, P., Nazzaro, M., Consumer-generated media (CGM) 101 Word-of-mouth in the age of the webfortified consumer (2006) New York: Nielsen BuzzMetrics; Cawsey, T., Rowley, J., Social media brand building strategies in B2B companies (2016) Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 34 (6), pp. 754-776; Collier, J.E., Bienstock, C.C., How do customers judge quality in an e-Tailer?

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of 103 articles published from year 1998 to 2014 by reviewing the research objectives, research findings, methodologies and research gaps of prior online service studies. Since, there are limited focus on online services research as a whole albeit several researchers concentrated specifically on areas such as e-banking and e-commerce, the authors summarized prior research by developing a unified framework - the Design for Online Service (DOS) framework-that synthesized the findings of success factors - web design, social networking, service provisioning, user involvement and critical success factors-in designing online services. The DOS framework provides a holistic view of determinants for the success of online service design, incorporating range set of factors and its criteria.
