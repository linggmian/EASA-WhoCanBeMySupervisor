Since then, researchers in cyber security have come out with numerous reports on threats and attack on organisations. This study is conducted to develop and propose a Cyber Security Defence Policies (CSDP) by harmonising and synthesizing the existing practices identified from the literature review. Observation and questionnaire were adopted to evaluate, review and collect data under ethical agreement from 10 organisations. The validation is based on the principal components for the proposed CSDP and the proposed CSDP, using SPSS as the statistical tool. The result shows that, the validation of the proposed CSDP by 20 experts reveals a standard deviation of 0.607, 0.759, 0.801, 0.754, 0.513, 0.587 and 0.510 on each of the principal components without a missing value respectively. While the correlation matrix and the reproduced correlation matrix for the proposed CSDP indicated 61% and the percentage of acceptance on the principal components for the proposed CSDP are higher than 50%. Therefore, from the outcome, it has shown that the acceptance responds towards the proposed CSDP and the result from the principal components analysis (eigenvalue analysis) are significant enough for implementation and can be adopted by organisations as a guidelines for organisation cyber security practices. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.","Cyber defence policy; Cyber security; Cyber security practices; Organisation",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315392","We would like to acknowledge and show our appreciation as this paper is supported by the Short Term Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (304/PKOMP/6315392).","Murray, E.J., Durcikova, A., Integrating IS security with knowledge management: Are we doing enough to thwart the persistent threat?

Factors such as availability and work hours highly influence the decision of forming a collaborative surgical team. This paper studies the factors that influence a surgical collaborative team and introduces additional factors to develop the framework of a knowledge-based system for surgical collaborative team. Social-based factor like trust and leadership are introduced in order to increase the efficiency of a team. Knowledge-based approach is incorporated together with a metaheuristic algorithm to automatically assign medical team and to form an efficient team based on the factors in the framework. The use of ontology is proposed to assist the knowledge management aspect. In order to optimize the team formation, the use of genetic algorithm is proposed. In this paper, the development of the knowledge-based framework for a surgical collaborative team is elaborated by looking into the existing and additional factors. The proposed knowledge management approach using an ontology schema is also discussed. This framework presented in this paper will be used to model a case study to get the feedback from practicing medical personnel especially on the relevance of the factors proposed in order to form the collaborative team. © 2019 IEEE.","collaborative team; genetic algorithm; knowledge management; ontology; team formation optimization","Genetic algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Ontology; Personnel; Surgery; Collaborative teams; Knowledge based framework; Knowledge-based approach; Medical personnel; Medical teams; Meta heuristic algorithm; Social-based; Team formation; Knowledge based systems",,,,,,,"Bridges, D.R., Davidson, R.A., Odegard, P.S., Maki, I.V., Tomkowiak, J., Interprofessional collaboration: Three best practice models of interprofessional education (2011) Med.

Coalition formation is an approach dedicated to achieve optimal group arrangement. We are working in the direction of identifying strategies to build a coalition formation system taking into consideration the social factors. Computational cultural dynamics (CCD) is a research area that intertwines computer technology with behavioural and social sciences. We find that this research has potential to be further expanded to study and build a group setting. At the same time, the value of knowledge is seen as an important factor to determine the success of such coalition especially from the social aspect. Therefore, with the motivation to achieve a CCD perspective of a knowledge based coalition formation, social factors are studied, where the knowledge derived from this process will be identified, represented and stored. In this paper, we present a framework for the knowledge based coalition formation focusing on structuring the social factors chosen to initiate the knowledge process of the coalition formation system. © 2010 IEEE.","Coaltion formation; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social factors","Coalition formations; Coaltion formation; Collaborative teams; Computer technology; Knowledge process; Research areas; Social factor; Specific tasks; Information technology; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social aspects; Knowledge representation",,,,,,,"Housel, T., Bell, A.H., (2001) Measuring and Managing Knowledge, , McGraw-Hill, Chapter 1; Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., (2001) Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, , 6th ed.
