Many internet users currently want to connect the internet for all utilities automatically. One of the technologies in the IPv6 network, which supports data access from moving users, is IPv6 Mobile protocol. In its mobility, the users on a range of networks can move the range to another network. High demand for this technology will interest to a hacker or a cracker to carry out an attack. One of them is a DoS attack that compromises a target to denial its services. A firewall is usually used to protect networks from external attacks. However, since the firewall based on the attacker database, the unknown may not be detected. In order to address the obstacle, a detection tool could be used. In this research, IDS as an intrusion detection tool was integrated with a firewall to be implemented in IPv6 Mobile to stop the DoS attack. The results of some experiments showed that the integration system could block the attack at 0.9 s in Correspondent Node and 1.2 s in Home Agent. The blocked attack can decrease the network throughput up to 27.44% when a Mobile Node in Home Agent, 28,87% when the Mobile Node in a Foreign Network. The final result of the blocked attack is reducing the average CPU utilization up to 30.99%. © 2020 IEEE.","DoS; Firewall; IDS; Mobile IPv6; Security","Denial-of-service attack; Inspection equipment; Intrusion detection; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Personal computing; Correspondent nodes; CPU utilization; Detection tools; Foreign network; Integration systems; Mobile device users; Mobile protocols; Network throughput; Internet protocols",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia

Most Internet connections nowadays are accessed using mobile devices in order to stay connected all the time and everywhere. Owing to the limited coverage of such access points as well as base stations, mobile devices are required to handover connectivity if there is a move to other locations. Horizontal handover is conducted when the movement is within the same network. Otherwise, there must be vertical handover when external network infrastructure is encountered. However, as the Internet is an open network that naturally lacks trust between users, the mobile nodes that move to an external network are susceptible to various attacking activities. Compromising mobile nodes may cause users to lose their data as well as destroy their mobile devices in terms of both software and hardware. Securing mobile devices is crucial in order to avoid losses in terms of not only money but also facilities. Although mobile nodes have been developed with certain security features, some researchers have found vulnerabilities. This paper surveys in detail the security vulnerabilities of mobile IPv6 vertical handover and the current relevant mitigation methods. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of mobile IPv6 vertical handover and its security vulnerability as well as security mechanisms proposed by researchers. Based on the survey, there are apparently weaknesses in current security features that are in need of solutions to minimize the effect of malicious activities. An open direction of future research on mobile IPv6 vertical handover security is elaborated at the end of this paper. © 2020 Supriyanto Praptodiyono et al.",,"Internet protocols; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems;

Most of them use mobile devices to connect to the internet. They aim to stay in connection every time and everywhere. Thus, they use mobile IP communication to get always connected to the internet while they move to another place. Fortunately, the telco infrastructure has reached many places in the world. Also, the video file transmission is now becoming a new trend, especially a short movie transmitted via social media. The huge of the internet connection caused the scarcity of Internet address. It was anticipated by introducing IPv6 that supported the mobility by presenting the Mobile IPv6. This paper evaluates the performance on the MIPv6 mechanism on transferring video when the user moves to another place that usually different network infrastructure. Therefore, the vertical handover does not disturb the quality of the video transmission. The experimentation results show during the vertical handover, the addition delay and packet loss is low especially when the network is overlap. If the network is not overlap, the main factor for the handover delay and packet loss is the distance between home network and a new network. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Image communication systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Packet loss; Personal communication systems; Radio systems; Delay and packet loss; Experimental evaluation; Handover delay; Internet connection; Network infrastructure; Real-time packets; Vertical handovers; Video transmissions; Internet protocols",,,,,,,,"(2019) Population Stats 2019, , https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, World Internet Users and [last accesed 28 July 2019]; (2019) Mobile Internet-Statistics and Facts, , https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/, [last accesed 19 February 2019]; (2018) Streaming Video Trends, , https://video.ibm.com/blog/ai-video-technology/streaming-video-trends-2018-top-5/, [last accesed 19 February 2019]; Aoun, C., Davies, E., Reasons to move the network address translator-protocol translation (NAT-PT) to historic status (2007) Request Fo Comments, p. 4966; Soliman, H., Mobile IPv6 support for dual stack hosts and routers (2009) Request Fo Comments, p. 5555; (2018) Internet Society State of IPv6 Deployment, , https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/, Online [last accesed 28 July 2019]; Ladid, L., Chochliouros, I.P.I.P., The impact of IPv6 on video-to-video and mobile video communications (2012) Proceesing of IFIP International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, 382, p. 322; Hassan, M.M., Hoong, P.K., Performance simulation and analysis of video transmission over proxy mobile IPv6 in a micro mobility domain (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Telecom Technology and Applications (ICTTA); Hassan, M.M., Hoong, P.K., Seamless handover integrated solution for video transmission over proxy mobile IPv6 in a micro mobility domain (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36, pp. 66-76; Qu, W., Qin, Y., Zhou, H., Zhang, H., Simulation-based performance comparison of video transmission over MIPv6, FMIPv6, HMIPv6, and FHMIPv6 (2006) Proceeding of IET International Conference on Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks, pp. 1-4; Usman, M., Yang, N., Jan, M.A., He, X., Xu, M., Lam, K.M., A joint framework for QoS and QoE for video transmission over wireless multimedia sensor networks (2017) IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 17, pp. 746-759; Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., Soliman, H., Neighbor discovery for IP version 6 (2007) Request for Comments, p. 4861","Praptodiyono, S.; Electrical Engineering Department, Jl.

Due to the dynamic nature of human activities, the evolving mobile technology has played a significant role and it is reflected in the exponential growth of the number of mobile users globally. However, the characteristic of the Internet as an open network made it vulnerable to various malicious activities. To secure communication at network layer, IETF recommended IPsec as a security feature. Mobile IPv6 as the successor of the current mobile technology, Mobile IPv4, also mandated the use of IPsec. However, since IPsec is a set of security algorithm, it has several well-known weaknesses such as bootstrapping issue when generating a security association as well as complex key exchange mechanism. It is a well-known fact that IPsec has a high overhead especially when implemented on Mobile IPv6 and used on limited energy devices such as mobile devices. This paper aims to enhance the IPsec performance by substituting the existing key exchange algorithm with a lightweight elliptic curve algorithm. The experiments managed to reduce the delay of IPsec in Mobile IPv6 by 67% less than the standard implementation. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

It offers some improvements including simpler header format and extension header resulting in faster transmission of IP packets. However, IPv6 is a network layer protocol that requires lower layer services. IP packets from the network layer pass to data link layer to be encapsulated by layer 2 headers and trailer to become frames. Ethernet is the most widely used data link layer protocol in the current network devices. The technology is always improved to support high speed transmission. However, from standard Ethernet until ten gigabit Ethernet, the size of MTU remains unchanged at 1500 Bytes. This prevents the network from gaining an optimum performance on transmitting IP packets and operating systems cannot take full advantage of the high-speed performance of Gigabit Ethernet. This research aims to implement the transmission of IPv6 packets using jumbo frame on a test-bed environment. The implementation can be used to justify the impact of jumbo frame on the network as well as operating systems performance. The results prove that the OS used on implementation of jumbo frame affects on the network performance. The highest percentage of increasing throughput is 33.6% when both sender and receiver are running Windows. The decreasing delay by 54.36% was happened when using Linux in sender and Windows in receiver. © 2019 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Ethernet; Ipv6 packet; Jumbo frame; Performance",,,,,,,,,"Deering, S., Hinden, R., Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification (1998) Internet Engineering Task Force, Request for Comments: 2460.

However, the standard of the protocol does not specify any security mechanism but only recommends the use of either Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) or Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) that has drawbacks when used within IPv6 local network. Furthermore, neither is enabled by default in the IPv6 local network; leaving the protocol unsecured. This paper proposes Trust-ND with reduced complexity by combining hard security and soft security approaches to be implemented on securing IPv6 link-local communication. The experimentation results showed that Trust-ND managed to successfully secure the IPv6 Neighbour Discovery. Trust-ND significantly cuts down the time to process NDP messages up to 77.21 ms for solicitation message and 100.732 ms for advertisement message. It also provides additional benefit over regular NDP in terms of data integrity for all Trust-ND messages with the introduction of Trust Option. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.","IPv6; Neighbor discovery protocol; Security; Trust management; Vulnerability",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM

Despite the ease of doing online banking, there are people that still sceptical in utilizing it due to perception and its security. This paper highlights the subject of online banking security in Malaysia, especially from the perspective of the end-users. The study is done by assessing human computer interaction, usability and security. An online survey utilising 137 participants was previously conducted to gain preliminary insights on security issues of online banking in Malaysia. Following from those results, 37 participants were interviewed to gauge deeper understanding about end-users perception on online banking within the context of usable security. The results suggested that most of the end-users are continuingly experiencing significant difficulties especially in relation to the technical terminologies, security features and other technical issues. Although the security features are provided to provide a shield or protection, users are still incapable to cope with the technical aspects of such implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Engineering research; Security of data; Security systems; Surveys; Terminology; Finance management; On-line banking; Security features; Security issues; Technical aspects; Technical terminology; Usability and security; Usable security; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,,"Furnell, S.M., Jusoh, A., Katsabas, D., Dowland, P.S., Considering the Usability of End-User Security Software' (2006) Proceedings of 21st IFIP International Information Security Conference (IFIP SEC 2006), pp. 307-316. , 2006b (Karlstad, Sweden,) (Springer Boston); (2015), http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/2519/2580469/addit_chmatl/TURBMC03_0131854615Ex.pdf, Capabilities Of Online Banking M.

It is developed not only to solve the addressing problem but also introduce some improvements on networking infrastructure. One of the improvements is the availability of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). Duplicate address detection (DAD) is one of the functions of NDP to make sure a generated IPv6 address is unique. However, since the NDP is not supported by a security mechanism, the DAD is vulnerable to DoS attack. Attacker can fail the detection process that causes on failing of IPv6 address configuration. The NDP standard suggested using IPSec or SeND to protect the NDP. However, the two security mechanisms introduced high computation due to the usage of cryptography algorithm. Further, its implementation in IPv6 local network is not trivial. This paper proposes a lightweight security mechanism based on distributed trust management that integrates hard security and soft security to secure the DAD in IPv6 called Trust-ND. The experimental result showed it could save the processing time of SeND mechanism up to 65.44 ms in sender and 23.53 ms in receiver. It also saves the available bandwidth up to 21.504 Kbps from the SeND mechanism. © 2015 IEEE.","duplicate address detection; IPv6; neighbor discovery; security; trust management","Bandwidth; Denial-of-service attack; Internet protocols; Duplicate address detection; IPv6; Neighbor discovery; security; Trust management; Network security",,,,,,,,"Davies, J., (2008) Understanding IPv6, , Washington: Microsoft Press; (2013), http://www.internetworldstats.com/, Internet World Statistic[latest accesed on 16 April 2014]; Audet, F., Jennings, C., (2007) Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP, , in Request for Comments 4787, Internet Engineering Task Force; Rekhter, Y., Li, T., (1993) An Architecture for IP Address Allocation with CIDR, , Request for Comments 1518, Internet Engineering Task Force; Narten, T., (2007) Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6), , Request for Comments 4861, Internet Engineering Task Force; Deering, S., Hinden, R., (1998) Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, , Request for Comments: 2460, December : Internet Engineering Task Force; Stallings, W., IP security (2000) The Internet Protocol Journal, 3 (1), pp. 11-26; Arkko, J., (2005) Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), , Request for Comments 3971, Internet Engineering Task Force; Arkko, J., Nikander, P., Limitations of IPsec policy mechanisms (2005) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Security Protocols, , Springer-Verlag: Cambridge, UK; AlSa'Deh, A., Meinel, C., Secure neighbor discovery: Review, challenges, perspectives, and recommendations (2012) Security & Privacy, IEEE, 10 (4), pp. 26-34; Abdul-Rahman, A., Hailes, S., A distributed trust model (1997) Proceedings of the 1997 Workshop on New Security Paradigms, pp. 48-60. , ACM: Langdale, Cumbria, United Kingdom; Cheshire, S., (2008) IPv4 Address Conflict Detection, 5227. , Request for Comments , Internet Engineering Task Force; Thomson, S., Narten, T., Jinmei, T., IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (2007) Request for Comments , Internet Engineering Task Force, 4862; Hinden, R., Deering, S., (2006) IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, , Request for Comment 4291, Internet Engineering Task Force; Narten, T., Draves, R., Krishnan, S., (2007) Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6, , Request for Comments 4941, Internet Engineering Task Force; Nikander, P., Kempf, E.J., Nordmark, E., (2004) IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats, , Request for Comments 3756, Internet Engineering Task Force; Arkko, J., Securing IPv6 neighbor and router discovery (2002) Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on Wireless Security, , Atlanta, GA, USA: ACM; Supriyanto, Survey of internet protocol version 6 link local communication security vulnerability and mitigation methods (2013) IETE Technical Review, 30 (1), pp. 64-71; Supriyanto, Risk analysis of the implementation of ipv6 neighbor discovery in public network (2014) International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI 2014), , Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Zhang, J., Fractals on ipv6 network topology (2013) TELKOMNIKA Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 11 (2), pp. 577-582; Gaeil, A., Analysis of send protocol through implementation and simulation (2007) International Conference on Convergence Information Technology; Gelogo, Y.E., Caytiles, R.D., Park, B., Threats and security analysis for enhanced secure neighbor discovery protocol (send) of ipv6 ndp security (2011) International Journal of Control and Automation, 4 (4), pp. 179-184; Bi, J., (2013) Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework, , Request for Comments 7039.

IPv6 also introduces a number of benefits including address auto-configuration mechanism which allows host to self-generate its own IPv6 address without the presence of a DHCPv6 server. It is one mechanism, among others, provided by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). However, the protocol does not have a built-in security mechanism and its messages were exchanged without security verification thus leaving the mechanism vulnerable to exploitation by malicious nodes. A malicious node could disrupt or tamper with the IPv6 address auto-generation process that will leave the victim without an IP address needed for communication or having a wrongly formed address. The NDP standard suggests either IPSec or SeND to secure the mechanism. Unfortunately, both security mechanisms have been extensively studied and were reported to have serious drawbacks that limit their implementation and adoption. This research proposes Trust-ND to secure IPv6 address auto-configuration mechanism based on a distributed trust mechanism. Experiment result shows that this mechanism is more lightweight and uses less bandwidth while still able to fulfill the required security feature. © 2015 IEEE.","address auto-configuration; IPv6; neighbor discovery; security; Trust-ND","Internet; Mechanics; MEMS; Network security; Address autoconfiguration; Auto-configuration; IPv6; Neighbor discovery; Neighbor discovery protocol; security; Security mechanism; Security verification; Internet protocols",,,,,,,,"Gubbi, J., Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions (2013) Future Generation Computer Systems, 29 (7), pp. 1645-1660; Thomson, S., Narten, T., Jinmei, T., IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration Request for Comments 4862, 2007, Internet Engineering Task Force; Narten, T., Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6) Request for Comments 4861, 2007, Internet Engineering Task Force; Kent, S., Seo, K., Security architecture for the internet protocol Request for Comments: 4301, 2005, Internet Engineering Task Force; Arkko E, J., SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) Request for Comments: 3971, 2005, Internet Engineering Task Force; Rafiee, H., Meinel, C., SSAS: A simple secure addressing scheme for ipv6 autoconfiguration (2013) 2013 Eleventh Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST); AlSa'Deh, A., Meinel, C., Secure neighbor discovery: Review, challenges, perspectives, and recommendations (2012) Security & Privacy, IEEE, 10 (4), pp. 26-34; Arkko, J., Nikander, P., Limitations of IPsec policy mechanisms (2005) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Security Protocols, , Springer-Verlag: Cambridge, UK; Hause, M., (2012) Killing Mac OS X and Server 2012, , https//samsclass.info/ipv6/proj/RA_flood2.htm#1; Wen, X., Performance investigation of IPsec protocol over IPv6 network (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on Advanced Intelligence and Awarenss Internet (AIAI 2010); Ferguson, N., Schneier, B., (2003) A Cryptographic Evaluation of IPsec, , Unpublished Work; Stockebrand, B., IP Security (IPsec) (2007) IPv6 in Practice, pp. 311-317. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Barchett, L.D., Problems using MD5 with IPv6 (1996) Perform.

Trust-ND introduced a new NDP option, called Trust option, with three fields: Message Generation Time (or timestamp), Nonce, and Message Authentication Data. A thorough investigation and analysis of the use of timestamp field has identified four scenarios which could result in Denial-of-Service (DoS) as well as a source of inefficiency. DoS is triggered when two or more IPv6 nodes in the same link have unsynchronized clocks with large time difference between them due to the use of local clock, attack on the synchronization mechanism, misconfiguration or faulty clock. DoS could also occurs as the result of faulty validation process caused by the inability of the timestamp to capture and represent two distinct messaging events due to insufficient granularity or lack of precision of the timestamp format. This paper presents measures to overcome the issue of DoS by proposing a change to the reference time to use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC); modification to the Trust-ND validation process to solve the problem of unsynchronized clocks among nodes; and a new timestamp format to increase the precision to correctly represent and distinguish two events occurring in less than hundredths of a second. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed trust management; IPv6 security; neighbor discovery protocol","Clocks; Internet protocols; Network security; Coordinated universal time; Investigation and analysis; IPv6 security; Lightweight securities; Message authentication; Neighbor discovery protocol; Synchronization mechanisms; Trust management; Denial-of-service attack",,,,,,,,"Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., Soliman, H., (2007) Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6), , RFC4861, Sept; Conta, A., Deering, S., (1998) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, , RFC2463, Dec; An, G., Kim, K., Jang, J., Jeon, Y., Analysis of SEND Protocol through Implementation and Simulation (2007) Proc.

DAD is included in Neighbor Discovery Protocol. DAD uses checksum for integrity checking. However, checksum is a low level security and it is relatively easy to generate an identical checksum code. This exposes DAD to spoofing and DoS attacks. RFC 4861 recommends the use of Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) to prevent the attack vector. However, most current operating system vendors are unwilling to adopt and implement SeND. This is because SeND appends significant number of NDP options to standard NDP message as well as requires a complex computation. This paper attempts to secure NDP by proposing a lightweight security mechanism to secure DAD with an innovative Trust Option called Trust-ND. Compared to SeND mechanism, Trust-ND saved up to 99.8% in sender and 99.7% in receiver. It also consumed less bandwidth compared to SeND by as much as 21.504 kbps. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

The RGB-HSV algorithm was then selected to improve the colour contrast of the transformed images. The proposed algorithm from RGB colour space to HSV colour space focuses on the brightness of red and blue colours where red is modified to light red while green is modified to dark blue. The modified algorithm is named as RGB-HSV (B), whereby the ‘B’ is referring to brightness. RGB-HSV (B) is then tested on a group of 12colour deficient individuals via a designed questionnaire handed out to them. The process of modification involves 4 different values of colour range.

This rapid growth caused the depletion of the current Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address, prompting IETF with the design of the new Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in the 1990’s. IPv6 is the next generation of the Internet Protocol designed with much larger address space and additional functions to ease its use for the users. One of the new functions is address auto configuration of new host’s via Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). However, the implementation of NDP is not without risk in terms of security. This paper analyzes the risk of NDP implementation in public network. The result shows a number of risks that appear on the implementation of NDP over a Public Network. Neighbors cannot be trusted 100%. One of them could be an attacker who may exploit the NDP message to get their own benefit. In addition the number of insiders increases time to time. © 2014, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Neighbor discovery includes router discovery, and redirect. Router discovery is used by an IPv6 host to discover the presence of routers and network parameters. It enables the host to configure list of default gateway, list of address prefixes, Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) in the link and hop limit setting for sending IPv6 packets. Failure to complete the initialization process will cause the network to have no IPv6 addresses, disabling it from sending any IPv6 packets and communication with others. As the original router discovery standard does not specify a security mechanism for it, they are vulnerable for any exploitation. This paper investigates the current router discovery mitigation methods such as ADD, SAVI, TRDP and RA Guard. The investigation would further increase the understanding on their weakness so that it could be used to formalize a new security method for router discovery. We propose a new security mechanism based on distributed trust management. Theoretical analysis of this mechanism shows a decrease in bandwidth consumption compared to ADD on Secure Neighbor Discovery mechanism up to 3.15 times lesser. © 2013 IEEE.","IPv6; Neighbor Discovery; Router Discovery; Security; Trust","IPv6; Neighbor discovery; Router discovery; Security; Trust; Gateways (computer networks); Network security; Routers",,,,,,,,"Narten, T., (2007) Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6), , Request for Comments 4861, Internet Engineering Task Force; Arkko E, J., (2005) SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), , Request for Comments 3971, Internet Engineering Task Force; Kent, S., Seo, K., (2005) Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, 4301. , Request for Comments: Internet Engineering Task Force; Nikander E, P., Kempf, J., Nordmark, E., (2004) IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats, , Request for Comments 3756, Internet Engineering Task Force; Alsa'Deh, A., Meinel, C., SEcure neighbor discovery: Review, challenges, perspectives and recommendations (2012) Security & Privacy, (99), pp. 26-34. , IEEE; Levy-Abegnoli, E., (2011) IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard, , Request for Comments 6105, Internet Engineering Task Force; Zhihui, Y., Gengsheng, D., Junyun, W., SAVI-based IPv6 source address validation implementation of the access network (2011) Proceeding of Computer Science and Service System (CSSS); Jun, Z., TRDP: A trusted router discovery protocol International on Symposium Communications and Information Technologies, 2007.

However, the poor performance of traditional mobile IP protocols can affect negatively delay sensitive services. Recently, network-based IP mobility has been proposed as a potential solution. Although initial evaluations have already confirmed the practical advantages of this new approach, a proper investigation of existing methods has yet to be performed. In the present paper, an evaluation framework is proposed to investigate handover performance metrics in network-based IP mobility. The framework is subsequently employed to analyze prominent methods. Analytical results highlight the efficiency of each solution under different operating conditions and reveal the main factors that affect the performance. Unlike other comparative studies, this framework has been developed to assist IP mobility designers in analyzing the effects of system parameters on their proposed solutions. A new prediction-based mobility solution for metropolitan area networks is suggested, and its design parameters are analyzed by utilizing the proposed framework. The present study not only provides deeper insights into network-based IP mobility but also a framework for faster analysis of future solutions in this category.

One of the most critical limitations faced by this approach is the scalability issue. In the MCS, the outgoing bandwidth of the server is shared among all concurrent clients. Thus, the more clients there are, the lesser the bandwidth each client can have. The performance of this approach therefore deteriorates rapidly as the number of simultaneous clients increases. In addition, a pure serverbased solution is expensive. Approach: In this research, the server-based infrastructure is modified into a peer-to-peer video conferencing system while preserving the same functionality and features of the existing MCS. This modification can be achieved using a hybrid content distribution model, which is a combination of fluid and chunk content distribution models to distribute parts of the video stream fairly among participants. The hybrid content distribution model offers a better way of handling heterogeneous networks because it can distinguish between a fast peer and a slow peer, dealing with each one according to its capabilities. Results: In our proposed system, the function server will not be used for video distribution. Instead, it will only be used for monitoring and controlling the peers to reduce the burden on the servers. Experimental results conducted in the nation advanced IPv6 center as a real environment and live conferencing. Conclusion: This will lead to overcome the problem of scalability and a bandwidth bottleneck on the main server and achieve good way to distribute video chunks. © 2012 Science Publications.","Content distribution; Heterogeneous network; Peer-to-peer; Video conferencing system; Widespread applications",,,,,,,,,"Afergan, M., Experience with some principles for building an internet-scale reliable system (2006) Proceedings of the 5th IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications, pp. 3-13. , DOI: 10.1109/NCA.2006.24, Jul. 24-26, IEEE Xplore Press, Cambridge, MA; Akkus, I.E., Civanlar, M.R., Ozkasap, O., Peer-to-peer multipoint video conferencing using layered video (2006) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 3053-3056. , Oct. 8-11, IEEE Xplore Press, Atlanta, GA; Andersen, D., Balakrishnan, H., Kaashoek, F., Morris, R., Resilient overlay networks (2001) SIGOPS Proceedings of the 18th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP), (SOSP' 01), Banff, Canada, 131, p. 145; Ardizzone, E., Gatani, L., Cassias, M.L., Re, G.L., Ortolani, M., Enhanced p2p services providing multimedia content (2007) Adv.

In general, video chunks distribution can be done through two approaches: A centralized network or an overlay network. However, the centralized network is expensive and not scalable. Therefore, many systems have resorted to the use of overlay network, which offers low cost and scalable systems by utilizing the resources of the node better. The current paper presents the two approaches for the video conferencing system, focusing on the systems that use the overlay network approach. It describes the challenges and solutions for distributing video chunks across different types of overlay networks centering on application layer multicast and peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The overlay network, particularly the hybrid system of peer- to-peer and application layer multicast, was found to be the optimal system in terms of scalability, bandwidth utilization, less delay, high quality, low cost, less congestion control, and better handling with heterogeneous network. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.","Application layer multicast; Overlay network; Peer-to-peer network",,,,,,,,,"(1997) Mul-tipoint Control Units for Audiovisual Systems Using Digita, , ITU-T Study Group XV -Recommendation H.231; (2003) Network Bandwidth White Paper, , http://www.webex.com/pdf/wp_bandwidth.pdf, WebEx Web Conferencing, Online Meetings and Video Conferencing, white paper Cisco WebEx LLC, Available at; David, A., Hari, B., Frans, K., Robert, Resilient overlay networks (2001) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 32; Pendarakis, D., Shi, S., Verma, D., Waldvogel, ALMI: An application level multicast infrastructure (2001) Proceedings of the 3rd conference on USENIX Symposium on Internet Technologies and Systems, , San Francisco, California.
