The latest threat Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) was originated by the United States Air Force in 2006 by Colonel Greg Rattray. APT is constantly ravaging industries and governments, which causes severe damages including data loss, espionage, sabotage, leak, or forceful pay of ransom money to the attackers. This study introduces a new model built on Adversarial Tactics Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATTCK) matrix for detecting APT attack. This is to identify the APT on the first potential victim when the attackers use credential dumping technique. Strange Behavior Inspection Model incorporating several models investigates and monitors APT behavioral features in the CPU, RAM, windows registry, and file systems proposed to detect APT Attack at the first potential victim machine. The Strange Behavior Inspection (SBI) Model proposed in this paper is designed to detect the attack before being developed to more advanced phases. The results of this study are presented at four levels:1- random access memory, 2-central processing unit, 3- windows registry, and 4- file systems. This study proposes a unique model as evidence to detect APT attacks before any other techniques are used. The proposed model reduces the detection time from nine-months to 2.7 minutes. © 2013 IEEE.","APT; ATT&CK; Attacker; dump; exploit; Mimikatz and credential dumping",,,,,,,,,,"Ghazi-Tehrani, A.K., Regulating cyber space: An examination of US-China relations (2016) Ph.D. Dissertation, Univ.

The automatic door gives access to go into or outside a building by sensing the approaching individual using sensors. However, it does not have the intuition to understand when a person is not authorized to go outside based on their age limit, for example, children. To address this problem, researchers have proposed solutions ranging from the use of fuzzy logic to rule-based approaches to make automatic doors better than the previous ones. In this study, an AI-based automatic door system is proposed, which uses a supervised machine learning approach to train classifiers using human body measurement. Our evaluation of different classifiers indicates that SVM is capable of classifying the instances correctly while achieving about 88.9% F-score. Thus, the proposed approach is expected to improve the safety of automatic doors, thereby making them smarter and more intelligent. © 2020 IEEE.","Automatic door; Body measurement; Machine Learning; Supervised Learning","Fuzzy logic; Supervised learning; Automatic doors; Automatic sliding doors; F-score; Human bodies; Mode of operations; Rule-based approach; Supervised machine learning; Use of fuzzy logic; Learning systems",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Postgraduate Conference Fund 2020.",,,"Yang, J.-C., Lai, C.-L., Sheu, H.-T., Chen, J.-J., An intelligent automated door control system based on a smart camera (2013) Sensors, 13 (5), pp. 5923-5936. , May; Lwin, H.H., Khaing, A.S., Tun, H.M., Automatic door access system using face recognition (2015) Int.

CS makes use of imaging techniques to identify an unknown skull by matching it with the available face photographs of missing individuals. Life-size enlargement of the face image and orientating the skull to correspond to the posture seen in the face photograph are the two main problems that affect identification accuracy with both the conventional and the computer-aided methods. Unlike the existing techniques, this research proposes a 3D skull–3D face model superimposition (3D–3D) approach to address the above two issues. The proposed method commences by reconstructing the 3D face model from a given 2D face image using the mean simplified generic elastic model, followed by registering the face model to a 3D skull along the jaw line using the analytical curvature B-spline (AC B-spline). The accuracy index of the registration is then evaluated to suggest the degree to which the face image corresponds to a skull. The superimpositions of positive and negative cases were conducted on a set of 3D skulls versus a set of 2D face images. The accuracy indices of the registration results suggest that the AC B-spline is more robust in 3D–3D superimposition compared to the other existing methods. The full experimental results have demonstrated the potential of the proposed method as an assistive tool to the forensic scientists for craniofacial identifications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3D face reconstruction; B-spline; Craniofacial superimposition; Curve registration; Generic elastic model","3D modeling; Computer forensics; Interpolation; Photography; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D face reconstruction; B splines; Craniofacial; Curve registration; Generic elastic models; Image reconstruction",,,,,"01-01-05-SF0045

This has exacerbated existing network attacks including ICMPv6-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and its variant form Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) aimed at tackling security issues raised by ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks have been reviewed by researchers and a general classification of existing IDSs was proposed as anomaly-based and signature-based. However, it is incredibly hard to see the overall picture of IDSs based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques with such a classification, as there is a lack of a more detailed view of the ML approach, classifiers, feature selection techniques, datasets, and different evaluation metrics. Nevertheless, recent developments in this relatively new field have not been covered such as ML-based IDSs using flow-based traffic representation. Therefore, this article specifically reviews and classifies IDSs based on ML techniques to detect ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks as single and hybrid classifiers. In addition, blockchain applicability in Collaborative IDS (CIDS) architecture based on the ensemble framework has been proposed as a solution to one of the open challenges for ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks detection problem. Moreover, this review also provides a classification of ICMPv6 vulnerabilities to DoS and DDoS attacks which would provide a reference resource for future researchers in this domain. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first review paper specifically focusing on IDSs based on ML techniques in this domain, as well as blockchain applicability as a possible research direction has been proposed to attract researcher's focus on building ensemble learning-based IDS models.

A few detection systems were proposed to detect these attacks based on self-generated datasets. These datasets used an unsuitable representation that depends on packets format as well as they include non-qualified features which lead to false alerts if the systems are applied in real networks. Moreover, most of the existing datasets are unavailable for other researchers’ usage due to their author’s privacy issues. The objective of this paper is benchmarking datasets of ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks to be used for the tuning, evaluations, and comparisons of any detection system of the attacks. The datasets setup is based on a real IPv6-enabled network topology and ensuring attack exposure. The proposed datasets are considered as the first labeled and publically available flow-based datasets represented using a set of flow-based features of the ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. The requirements of good datasets have been achieved in the proposed datasets to ensure they are worthy be used by other researchers. Moreover, the datasets and their features proved their abilities to represent the attacks traffics by achieving robust and acceptable high detection accuracies as well as low false positive rate. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Dataset generation; Features extraction; Flow-based datasets; ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks; Intrusion detection","Feature extraction; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Dataset generation; DDoS Attack; Detection accuracy; False positive rates; Features extraction; Flow based; Internet control message protocols; Network topology; Denial-of-service attack",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PNAV/6313272","This research was supported by the Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/6313272.",,,"Conta, A., Gupta, M., Internet control message protocol (Icmpv6) for the internet protocol version 6 (ipv6) specification (2006) Request for Comments, p. 4443. , https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4443.Last, Accessed Aug 2015; Postel, J., Rfc 792: Internet control message protocol (1981) Request for Comments, 792. , https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792, online, Last Accessed 2016; Elejla, O.E., Anbar, M., Belaton, B., Icmpv6-based dos and ddos attacks and defense mechanisms: Review (2016) IETE Tech Rev, 34, pp. 1-18; Ard, J.B., (2012) Internet protocol version six (ipv6) at uc davis: traffic analysis with a security perspective, , University of California, Davis; Weber, J., Wegener, C., Schwenk, J., (2013) Ipv6 security test laboratory,” master dissertation Department of Network and Data Security, , Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum; Elejla, O.E., Belaton, B., Anbar, M., Alnajjar, A., A reference dataset for icmpv6 flooding attacks (2016) J Eng Appl Sci, 11 (3), pp. 476-481; Lakhina, A., Crovella, M., Diot, C., Characterization of network-wide anomalies in traffic flows (2004) Proceedings of the 4Th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement, pp. 201-206; Sperotto, A., Sadre, R., Pras, A., Anomaly characterization in flow-based traffic time series (2008) International Workshop on IP Operations and Management, Springer, Berlin, pp. 15-27; Strayer, W.T., Lapsely, D., Walsh, R., Livadas, C., Botnet detection based on network behavior (2008) Botnet Detection.

Visual Analytics (VA) is a modern visualization supported with automated processing method. The major impulse of the method lies in its ability to integrate the key component of scientific visualization and search based heuristics in the same optimization model. This paper presents a visual analytics process (VAP) adapted for UETP. The adaption involves the human context of visual analytics on timetabling data, which are typically processed computationally with local search algorithm and then visualized and interpreted by the user in order to perform problem solving with direct interactions between the primary data, processing and visualization. The three processing phases are invoked with user-driven and algorithmic-driven steering that analyses the combined effect with automatic tuning of algorithmic parameters based on constraints and the criticality of the application for the simulations is proposed. The optimal solution for the small datasets and best overall results for the medium and large datasets are experimented. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Algorithm driven steering; Examination timetabling; Interactive visualization; User-driven","Data handling; Data visualization; Heuristic methods; Intelligent computing; Optimization; Processing; Scheduling; Visualization; Algorithmic parameters; Automated processing; Direct interactions; Examination timetabling; Interactive visualizations; Local search algorithm; Optimization modeling; User driven; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,"Ranson, D., Cheng, P.-H., Graphical tools for heuristic visualization (2005) Proceedings of the 2Nd Multidisciplinary International Conference on Scheduling: Theory and Applications (MISTA), pp. 658-667. , Kendall, G., Lei, L., Pinedo, M.

Intrusion Detection systems (IDS) are a popular software to detect any possible attacks. Among the mechanisms that are used to build accurate IDSs, classification algorithms are extensively used due to their efficiency and auto-learning ability. This paper aims to evaluate classification algorithms for detecting the dangerous and popular IPv6 attacks which are ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. A comparison between five classification algorithms namely Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks (NN) were conducted. The comparison was conducted using a publicly available flow-based dataset. The experimental results showed that classifiers have detected most of the included attacks with a range from 73%-85% for the true positive rate. Moreover, KNN classification algorithm has been the fastest algorithm (0.12 seconds) with the best detection accuracy (85.7%) and less false alarms (0.171). However, SVM achieved the lowest detection accuracy (73%) while NN was the slowest algorithm in training the detection model (323 seconds). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Attacks detection; Decision tree; ICMPv6; Intrusion detection systems; IPv6; K-Nearest neighbors; Naïve bayes; Neural networks; Support vector machine","Barium compounds; Decision trees; Denial-of-service attack; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Classification algorithm; ICMPv6; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPv6; K nearest neighbor (KNN); K-nearest neighbors; K-NN classifications; True positive rates; Data mining",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 1001/PKOMP/8014018","The authors would like to thank the School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for providing the facilities and support.

However, ICMPv6 protocol is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks that are based on ICMPv6 messages. ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks are the most performed attacks against IPv6 networks and considered a grave problem of today Internet. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) under different categories have been proposed to detect ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. However, these IDSs are inefficient in detecting the attacks due to their limitations. The main limitation of the existing IDSs is the dependency on packet-based representation and features which are unsuitable for detecting DDoS attacks as experimentally proven. Therefore, this research proposes a new IDS, based on a flow-based representation of traffic, and a set of novel features for detecting the attacks. This is the first time a flow-based representation and features are proposed to detect ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. Cross-validation and supplied set testing approaches have been applied to evaluate the proposed IDS using seven classifiers. The evaluation experiments were conducted based on real datasets and showed that the proposed flow-based IDS with the proposed novel features is efficient and reliable in detecting ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks with acceptable detection accuracies and false positive rates. © 2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Data mining-based IDS; DDoS; DoS; Flow-based anomaly detection; ICMPv6; IPv6 networks; Network flow",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PNAV/ 6313272","Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/ 6313272.",,,"Conta, A., Deering, S., Gupta, M., Internet control message protocol (Icmpv6) for the internet protocol version 6 (ipv6) specification (2006) Internet Requests for Comments, RFC, , http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4443.txt, Editor, RFC 4443, Accessed 25 Jan 2017; Postel, J., Internet control message protocol.

DoS and DDoS attacks that are using Internet Control Message Protocol version six (ICMPv6) messages are the most common attacks against the Internet Protocol version six (IPv6). They are common because of the necessary inclusion of the ICMPv6 protocol in any IPv6 network to work properly. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) of the Internet Protocol version four (IPv4) can run in an IPv6 environment, but they are unable to solve its security problems such as ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks due to the new characteristics of IPv6, such as Neighbour Discovery Protocol and auto-configuration addresses. Therefore, a number of IDSs have been either exclusively proposed to detect IPv6 attacks or extended from existing IPv4 IDSs to support IPv6. This paper reviews and classifies the detection mechanisms of the existing IDSs which are either proposed or extended to tackle ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first review paper that explains and clarifies the problems of ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks and that classifies and criticizes the existing detection. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","DDoS; DoS; ICMPv6; IDS; Intrusion Detection System; IPv6 networks","DOS; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Network security; Problem solving; Auto-configuration; DDoS; Detection mechanism; Distributed denial of service attack; ICMPv6; Internet control message protocols; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPv6 networks; Denial-of-service attack",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PNAV/6313272","This research was supported by the Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/6313272.",,,"Elejla, O.E., Anbar, M., Belaton, B., Icmpv6-based dos and ddos attacks and defense mechanisms: Review (2016) IETE Tech Rev, pp. 1-18; Hasbullah, I.H., Murugesan, R.K., Ramadass, S., Survey of internet protocol version 6 link local communication security vulnerability and mitigation methods (2013) IETE Tech Rev, 30 (1), pp. 64-71; Conta, A., Gupta, M., (2006) Internet Control Message Protocol (Icmpv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (Ipv6) Specification, , https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4443, Request for Comments 4443, Last.

In this study we proposed a self-contained framework to generate landmarks on surfaces extracted from volumetric data. The framework is designed to be a three-fold pipeline structure. The pipeline comprises three phases which are surface construction, crest line extraction and landmark identification. With input as a volumetric data and output as landmarks, the pipeline takes in 3D raw data and produces a 0D geometry feature. In each phase we investigate existing methods, extend and tailor the methods to fit the pipeline design. The pipeline is designed to be functional as it is modularised to have a dedicated function in each phase. We extended the implicit surface polygonizer for surface construction in first phase, developed an alternative way to compute the gradient of maximal curvature for crest line extraction in second phase and finally we combine curvature information and K-means clustering method to identify the landmarks in the third phase. The implementations are firstly carried on a controlled environment, i.e. synthetic data, for proof of concept. Then the method is tested on a small scale data set and subsequently on huge data set. Issues and justifications are addressed accordingly for each phase. © 2017 Zheng et al.

One of these attacks is Router Advertisement (RA) flooding attack by sending a huge traffic toward a victim to consume its resources and stop its services. To detect these attacks, classification processes are applied based on a set of features used to represent the network traffic. This paper proposes a set of representative features depends on a suitable formation of data using a flow representation of the traffic. The proposed features and representation have achieved an acceptable detection ability of the RA flooding attacks using several classification techniques. Moreover, the achieved detection ability might be further improved by extracting more representative features or selecting a subset of them to represent the traffic. © 2017 IEEE.","Attack detection; Features; Flow; ICMPv6; RA flooding","Floods; Routers; Attack detection; Classification process; Classification technique; Detection ability; Features; Flow; ICMPv6; Router Advertisements; Feature extraction",,,,,,,,,"Durda, E., Buldu, A., IPV4/IPV6 security and threat comparisons (2010) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, pp. 5285-5291; Elejla, O.E., Belaton, B., Anbar, M., Alnajjar, A., Intrusion detection systems of icmpv6-based DDoS attacks (2016) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-12; Elejla, O.E., Anbar, M., Belaton, B., ICMPv6-Based dos and ddos attacks and defense mechanisms: Review (2016) IETE Technical Review, pp. 1-18; Conta, A., Gupta, M., (2006) Internet Control Message Protocol (icmpv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (ipv6) Specification; Liu, W., Ren, P., Sun, D., Zhao, Y., Liu, K., Study on attacking and defending techniques in IPv6 networks (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP), pp. 48-53; Beck, F., Cholez, T., Festor, O., Chrisment, I., Monitoring the neighbor discovery protocol (2007) Second International Workshop on IPv6 Today-Technology and Deployment-IPv6TD 2007; Herrera, A., How secure is the next-generation internet?

A new protocol named IPv6 was developed in 1998 to overcome the addressing issue and to improve network communications in general. IPv6 is an improved protocol compared to IPv4 in terms of security since it provides built-in security mechanisms, such as IPSec. In addition, it brought new functionalities, such as Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP) procedure, which depends on Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) protocol messages. However, IPv6 inherited a number of attacks from IPv4 in addition to new attacks it brought within its new features. One of the most common attacks is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to its ease of being launched in different ways. A more serious DoS attack can be launched from many hosts called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). DoS and DDoS attacks are thorny and a grave problem of today's internet, resulting in economic damages for organizations and individuals. Therefore, this paper is created to study the properties of DoS and DDoS attacks against IPv6 networks using ICMPv6 messages. Additionally, it analyzes the various existing detection and prevention approaches that are proposed to tackle ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks. Moreover, it explains the existing tools that might be used for performing these attacks. © 2017 IETE.","DDoS; DoS; ICMPv6; IPv6 security; NDP","Computer crime; DOS; Internet protocols; Network security; DDoS; Discovery protocol; Distributed denial of service; ICMPv6; Internet control message protocols; IPv6 security; Network communications; Security mechanism; Denial-of-service attack",,,,,,,,,"Tripathi, N., (2013) DoS and DDoS attacks: Impact, analysis and countermeasures; Saad, R.M., Ramadass, S., Manickam, S., A study on detecting ICMPv6 flooding attack based on IDs (2013) Australian J.

As an initial step to understand IPv6 networks and their vulnerabilities it is of critical importance to identify the characteristics of the connected devices. Detecting the OS fingerprints of these devices is one of these characteristics that are essential to identifying the vulnerabilities of each of them. Currently, few OS detection methods have supported IPv6 protocol, as it did not fully replace IPv4 yet. This paper attempts to describe the existing methods of OS fingerprinting with IPv6, as well as their challenges and limitations. Moreover, this paper studies the available datasets that might be used for IPv6 OS fingerprinting. By understanding the existing methods and datasets, the reader can figure out the current needs for proposing new OS fingerprinting methods for IPv6 protocol. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","IPv6 protocol; Network security; OS fingerprinting","Network protocols; Network security; Detection methods; Fingerprinting methods; IPv6 networks; IPv6 protocol; Security issues; Internet protocols",,,,,,,,,"(2014), https://www.abiresearch.com/press/the-internet-of-things-will-drive-wireless-connect/, The Internet of Things will Drive Wireless Connected Devices to 40.9 Billion in 2020.

In practical applications, however, the general organelles' features are often known in advance, yet the actual organelles' morphology is not elaborated. Two primary contributions of this paper are firstly the classification of insulin granules based on its image features and morphology for accurate segmentation - mainly focused at pre-processing image segmentation and secondly the new hybrid meshing quantification is presented.

With the advent of laser scanners the surface can be captured with high resolution generating a large amount of data. Processing this amount of data for point set registration efficiently, poses the type of challenges being addressed by the big data community. Coherent Point Drift (CPD) is a state-of-the-art point set registration method, that is able to handle large point cloud registration in O(n) time with the incorporation of the Fast Gauss Transform (FGT) and low-rank matrix approximation (LRA). However, its registration accuracy degrades rapidly for large point sets. To overcome this, we present a strategy that divides a large point set into several smaller overlapping subsets. These subsets are then independently registered using CPD that are then merged for final registration. To improve registration accuracy, we also propose a method to tune the width parameter of the Gaussian kernel in CPD. The proposed method has been tested on four large datasets, including the USF 3D face dataset. The results show that the proposed method is able to register large datasets with greater speed and accuracy than the state-of-the-art CPD method. © 2015 IOS Press.","coherent point drift (CPD); division; Gaussian kernel; Gaussian mixture models (GMMs); Large point sets registration","Data handling; Gaussian distribution; Geometry; Object recognition; Coherent point drifts; division; Gaussian kernels; Gaussian mixture model (GMMs); Point set; Division; Big data",,,,,"61473111",,,,"Myronenko, A., Song, X., Point set registration: Coherent point drift (2010) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32 (12), pp. 2262-2275; Myronenko, A., Song, X., Carreira-Perpinñań, M.A., Non-rigid point set registration: Coherent point drift (2006) Proceedings of the Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pp. 1009-1016; Dou, Y., Huang, Y., Li, Q., Luo, S., A fast template matchingbased algorithm for railway bolts detection (2014) International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 5 (6), pp. 835-844; Wang, X.Z., He, Y.L., Wang, D., Non-naive Bayesian classifiers for classification problems with continuous attributes (2014) IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 44 (1), pp. 21-39; Wang, X.Z., Dong, L.C., Yan, J.H., Maximum ambiguity based sample selection in fuzzy decision tree induction (2012) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 24 (8), pp. 1491-1505; Zhai, J.H., Zhai, M.Y., Bai, C.Y., An improved algorithm for calculating fuzzy attribute reducts (2013) Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 25 (2), pp. 303-313; Zhai, J.H., Zhai, M.Y., Kang, X.M., Condensed fuzzy nearest neighbor methods based on fuzzy rough set technique (2014) Intelligent Data Analysis, 18 (3), pp. 429-447; Acar, U.A., Chen, Y., Streaming big data with self-adjusting computation (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 Workshop on Data Driven Functional Programming, pp. 15-18; Bishop, C.M., (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, , Springer, New York; Figueiredo, M.A.T., Jain, A.K., Unsupervised learning of finite mixture models (2002) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 24 (3), pp. 381-396; Poullis, C., A framework for automatic modeling from point cloud data (2013) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35 (11), pp. 2563-2575; Isenburg, M., Liu, Y., Shewchuk, J., Snoeyink, J., Streaming computation of delaunay triangulations (2006) Proceedings of the SIGGRAPH'06, pp. 1049-1056; Chen, J., Zaman, M., Liao, I.Y., Belaton, B., Bi-stage large point set registration using Gaussian mixture models (2014) Proceedings of the 12th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV'14), , press; Chui, H., Rangarajan, A., A new algorithm for non-rigid point matching (2000) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR00), pp. 44-51; Chui, H., (2001) Non-rigid Point Matching: Algorithm, Extensions and Applications, , Ph.

The registration is an indispensible step before distinguishing the variation among the images. Neural network (NN) has a strong learning ability from a mass unstructured point cloud even containing noisy data. Neural network has been applied to register 3D reconstructed ear data and 3D surface of bunny and to achieve the better results. Motivated by this idea, NN-based registration method for 3D rigid face image is proposed. This paper presented the proof process of obtaining rotation matrix and translation vector according to the training process of neural network. Then the measure index of registration performance was provided. The elaborate experiments were conducted on the 3D USF face database (provided by the University of South Florida) to verify the effectiveness of neural network as a registration method. Next, two comparisons were performed, one group was NN-based and ICP-based registration methods and the other group was our proposed NN-based and other NN-based registration methods. The experimental results showed that neural network is a robust and potential registration method for rigid face image registration. Furthermore, our proposed NN-based registration method is extended easily to do 2D-to-3D registration and non-rigid face registration. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","3D face registration; Alignment; Iterative Closest Point (ICP); Linear transformation; Neural network (NN); Supervised learning","Alignment; Image enhancement; Image registration; Iterative methods; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Supervised learning; 3D face registrations; Intelligent detection; Iterative closest point; Neural network (nn); Real-time video monitoring; Registration methods; Registration performance; Unstructured point clouds; Neural networks",,,,,"F2012201023",,,,"Abche, A.B., Yaacoub, F., Maalouf, A., Karam, E., Image registration based on neural network and Fourier transform (2006) The 28th IEEE EMBS Annual International Conference, pp. 4803-4806. , New York City: USA; Alyüz, N., Gökberk, B., Dibeklioglu, H., Akarun, L., Component-based registration with curvature descriptors for expression insensitive 3d face recognition (2008) The 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, pp. 1-6; Besl, P.J., McKay, N.D., A method for registration of 3-D shapes (1992) IEEE Transaction Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 14 (2), pp. 239-256; Blanz, V., Vetter, T., A morphable model for the synthesis of 3D faces (1999) The 26th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, pp. 187-194; Blanz, V., Vetter, T., Face recognition based on fitting a 3D morphable model (2003) IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 25 (9), pp. 1063-1074; Cui, Y., Pei, J., Tang, G., Luk, W.-S., Jiang, D., Hua, M., Finding email correspondents in online social networks (2013) World Wide Web, 16 (2), pp. 195-218; Dahm, N., Gao, Y., A Novel Pose Invariant Face Recognition Approach Using a 2D-3D Searching Strategy (2010) The 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 3967-3970; Duffner, S., (2007) Face image analysis with Convolutional neural networks, , Doctoral dissertation: Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg; Duffner, S., Garcia, C., Robust Face Alignment Using Convolutional Neural Networks (2008) The 3th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications, vol. 2, pp. 30-37; Gökberk, B., İrfanoğlu, M.O., Akarun, L., 3D shape-based face representation and feature extraction for face recognition (2006) Image and Vision Computing, 24 (8), pp. 857-869; Horaud, R., Forbes, F., Yguel, M., Dewaele, G., Zhang, J., Rigid and articulated point registration with expectation conditional maxinization (2011) IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 33 (3), pp. 587-602; Jian, B., Vemuri, B.C., Robust point set registration using Gaussian mixture models (2011) IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 33 (8), pp. 1633-1645; Kumar, S., Neural Networks: A Classroom Approach (2004) Tata McGraw-Hill Education; Liu, L., Tang, W., Buttler, D., Pu, C., Information monitoring on the web: a scalable solution (2002) World Wide Web, 5 (4), pp. 263-304; Liu, H., Yan, J., Zhang, D., Three-dimensional surface registration: a neural network strategy (2006) Neurocomputing, 70 (1-3), pp. 597-602; Liu, H., Yan, J., Zhang, D., A neural network strategy for 3d surface registration (2006) The 6th international conference on Computational Science and Its Applications - Volume Part I, pp. 528-536; Mostafa, M.G., Farag, A.A., Essock, E.: Multimodality image registration and fusion using neural network.

For a given set of data points, knot vectors are computed using the centripetal approach. Next, number of data points is assimilated around the high curvature areas and the parametrization aspect is computed by the inverse chord length with the new set of data points. Second order derivatives are used to determine the high curvature areas of the curves. The method proposed here enables to construct the curves smoothly around high curvature areas by assigning adequate number of data points for the B-splines. Experimental validations justify the fact that the average curve fitting error yielded by the proposed approach is the lowest when compared to other standard curve models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Centripetal method; Inverse chord length; Non-uniform cubic B-spline; Second order derivative","Algorithms; Information science; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Ship propellers; Analytical approach; Centripetal method; Chord lengths; Cubic B -spline; Experimental validations; Number of datum; Parametrizations; Second order derivatives; Curve fitting",,,,,"1001/PKOMP/811290, 1001/PKOMP/846051","This research is supported by the RU-PRGS Universiti Sains Malaysia (1001/PKOMP/846051) grant titled “Skull and Photo Superimposition with Conditional Anthropological Parameters using Computer Sciences.” and RUI grant (1001/PKOMP/811290).

By using Maximum Posterior Probability estimation, prior information modeled by PCA is connected to Tikhonov regularization method in order to solve the ill-posed problem of 3D face reconstruction. The prior information is learned from 3D faces of a standard 3D database. However, the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ is usually not available in advance. To overcome this problem, we restrict the distance between the reconstructed 3D face and the average 3D face close to the average of the distances between sample 3D faces and the average 3D face. This is due to the fact that the sample data are mostly located at the boundary of the data space for high dimensional and low sample size problems, which is the case for 3D faces. The optimal regularization parameter is then obtained to reconstruct the 3D face shape of a given 2D near frontal image using limited number of feature. The solution is plausible while not over-smoothing. By warping the 2D texture to the reconstructed face shape, 3D face reconstruction is achieved. Our experimental results justify the robustness of the proposed approach with respect to the reconstruction of realistic 3D face shapes from a small set of 2D facial coordinates. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","3D face reconstruction; High dimension low sample size; PCA; Tikhonov regularization","Information science; Parameterization; Problem solving; 3D face reconstruction; Maximum posterior probability; Optimal regularization; PCA; Regularization parameters; Sample sizes; Tikhonov regularization; Tikhonov regularization method; Face recognition",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is supported by the RUI grant: RUI# 1001/PKOMP/811290 awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia.",,,"Zhenqiu, Z., Yuxiao, H., Tianli, Y., Huang, T., Minimum variance estimation of 3D face shape from multi-view (2006) 7Th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FGR 2006, pp. 547-552; Widanagamaachchi, W.N., Dharmaratne, A.T., 3D face reconstruction from 2D images (2008) Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, DICTA 2008, pp. 365-371. , IEEE; Martin, D.L., Yingfeng, Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person (2009) Pattern Recogn.

Many current methods, become extremely slow as the cardinality of the point set increases; making them impractical for large point sets. In this paper, we propose a bi-stage method called bi-GMMTPS, based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Thin-Plate Splines (GMMTPS). The first stage deals with global deformation. The two point sets are grouped into clusters independently using K-means clustering. The cluster centers of the two sets are then registered using a GMM based method. The point sets are subsequently aligned based on the transformation obtained from cluster center registration. At the second stage, the GMM based registration method is again applied, to fine tune the alignment between the two clusters to address local deformation. Experiments were conducted on eight publicly available datasets, including large point clouds. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, is much faster than state-of-the-art methods GMM-TPS and QPCCP (Quadratic Programming based Cluster Correspondence Projection); especially on large non-rigid point sets, such as the swiss roll, bunny and USF face datasets, and challenging datasets with topological ambiguity such as the banana dataset. Although the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) method has comparable computational speed, it is less robust than bi-GMM-TPS. Especially for large point sets, under conditions where the number of clusters is not extreme, a complexity analysis shows that bi-GMM-TPS is more efficient than GMM-TPS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Computer vision; Deformation; Quadratic programming; Coherent point drifts; Computational speed; Gaussian Mixture Model; Point-set registrations; Registration methods; Spatial transformation; State-of-the-art methods; Topological ambiguity; Geometry",,,,,"61473111",,,,"Bishop, C.M., (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, , Springer, New York; Bookstein, F.L., Principal warps: Thin-plate splines and the decomposition of deformations (1989) IEEE Trans.

The two common factors that are generally concerned with such models are the size of the training dataset and the selection of different examples in the training set. The representational power (RP) of an example-based model is its capability to depict a new 3D face for a given 2D face image. The RP of the model can be increased by correspondingly increasing the number of training samples. In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D face reconstruction model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. A PCA-based 3D face model is adapted for each new near frontal input face image to reconstruct the 3D face shape. Further an extended Tikhonov regularisation method has been employed to reconstruct 3D face shapes from a set of facial points. The results justify that the proposed adaptive PCA-based model considerably improves the RP of the standard PCA-based model and outperforms it with a 95% confidence level. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.",,"2D images; 3d face shapes",,,,,,,,,"Elyan, E., Ugail, H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations (2007) J.

Fingerprinting process is performed as step before the attack stage on the remote host. There are two types of fingerprinting; active and passive fingerprinting. However, each type encountered limitation when implemented separately in networks, and their inability to provide accurate information about the host services/applications. The main objective of this paper is to propose possibility of enhancing the detection process of the host profiling, applications/ services fingerprinting and the methods of host identification. Herein, we perform network host profiling by identifying different services/ applications that were running on the host. More so, we exploit sophisticated process of application layer protocol payloads by active and passive fingerprinting tools. Besides, we attempt to add a layer of correctness into these tool results, by building a new database of signatures which is derived from these results. The new signature database can be tested either exactly or through approximate fuzzy matching. The experiment results give a better accurate output compare to the base tools alone. © 2013 IEEE.","active and passive fingerprinting; fingerprinting; fuzzy; matching; remote services/applications detection",,,,,,,,,,"Yarochkin, F.V., Arkin, O., Dai, M.K.S.-Y., Huang, Y., Kuo, S.-Y., Xprobe2++: Low volume remote network information gathering tool (2009) Proc.

In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D reconstruction PCA-based model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. By adding these deformed samples together with the original training samples we gain more RP. A 3D PCA-based model is adapted for each new input face image by deforming 3D faces in the training data set. This adapted model is used to reconstruct the 3D face shape for the given input 2D near frontal face image. Our experimental results justify that the proposed adaptive model considerably improves the RP of the conventional PCA-based model. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Representational Power; Statistical facial modeling; TPS","3D face reconstruction; Facial model; PCA; Representational Power; TPS; Deformation; Face recognition; Information science; Three dimensional",,,,,,,,,"Atick, J., Griffin, P., Redlich, A., Statistical approach to shape from shading: Reconstruction of three-dimensional face surfaces from single two-dimensional images (1996) Neural Computation, 8 (6), pp. 1321-1340; Besl, P., McKay, H., A method for registration of 3D shapes (1992) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14 (2), pp. 239-256; Blanz, V., Vetter, T., Face recognition based on fitting a 3D morphable model (2003) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25 (9), pp. 1063-1074; Blanz, V., Vetter, T., A morphable model for the synthesis of 3D faces (1999) Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, SIGGRAPH 1999, pp. 187-194. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/311535.311556, ACM Press/Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., New York; Bookstein, F.L., Principal warps: Thin-plate splines and the decomposition of deformations (1989) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis AndMachine Intelligence, 11 (6), pp. 567-585; Bottino, A., De Simone, M., Laurentini, A., Sforza, C., A new 3D tool for planning plastic surgery (2012) IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering; Brown, B., Rusinkiewicz, S., Non-rigid range-scan alignment using thin-plate splines (2004) Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization and Transmission, 3DPVT 2004, pp. 759-765. , IEEE; Elyan, E., Ugail, H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations (2007) JCP, pp. 1-8; Fanany, M.I., Ohno, M., Kumazawa, I., Face Reconstruction from Shading Using Smooth Projected Polygon Representation NN (2002) Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Vision Interface, Calgary, Canada, pp. 308-313. , May; Farkas, L.G., (1994) Anthropometry of the Head and Face, , 2nd edn.

Because of all points in ICP-based method are processed at each iteration to find their correspondences, the method's performance is bounded by this constraint. This paper introduces an alternative ICP-based method by considering only subset of points whose boundaries are determined by the context of the inputs. These subsets can be used to sufficiently derive spatial mapping of point's correspondences between the source and target set even if points have been missing or modified slightly in the target set. A brief description of this method is followed by a comparative analysis of its performance against two ICP-based methods, followed by some experiments on its subset's sensitivity and robustness against noise. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","Correspondences; Expectation Maximization (EM); Iterative Closest Point (ICP); Registration error; Subset; Transformation","Correspondences; Expectation Maximization; Iterative closest point; Registration error; Subset; Transformation; Geometry; Image registration; Information science; Set theory; Iterative methods",,,,,,,,,"Myronenko, A., Song, X., Point Set Registration: Coherent Point Drift (2010) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32 (12), pp. 2262-2275; Besl, P.J., McKay, N.D., A Method for Registration of 3-D Shapes (1992) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14 (2), pp. 239-256; Chen, Y., Medioni, G., Object Modeling by Registration of Multiple Range Images (1992) Image and Vision Computing, 10 (3), pp. 145-155; Ezra, E., Sharir, M., Efrat, A., On the performance of the ICP algorithm (2008) Computational Geometry, 41, pp. 77-93; Jost, T., Hügli, H., A Multi-Resolution ICP with Heuristic Closest Point Search for Fast and Robust 3D Registration of Range Images (2003) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling, pp. 427-433; Zinßer, T., Schmidt, J., Niemann, H., A Refined ICP Algorithm for Robust 3-D Correspondence Estimation (2003) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 695-698; Santamaría, J., Cordón, O., Damas, S., A comparative study of state-of-the-art evolutionary image registration methods for 3D Modeling (2011) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 115 (9), pp. 1340-1354; Granger, S., Pennec, X., Multi-scale EM-ICP: A Fast and Robust Approach for Surface Registration (2002) LNCS, 2353, pp. 418-432. , Heyden, A., Sparr, G., Nielsen, M., Johansen, P.

Tikhonov regularization is a popular method that incorporates prior information towards providing the existence of closed-form solutions which we obtain as a result of applying PCA, in order to solve the ill-posed problem. The common factors that generally affect Tikhonov regularization are the regularization matrix, the number of feature points, regularization parameters and noise. In this study we report our findings on how various factors influence the reconstruction accuracy based on a case study performed on the USF Human ID 3D database. Further, a statistical comparison between two Tikhonov regularization matrices viz., the identity matrix and the diagonal matrix comprising of the eigenvalues (eigenvalue matrix), has been performed. We found that, the reconstruction error can be reduced significantly by using the later one. Finally our study aids to determine the most feasible interval in conjunction with optimal regularization parameters which would lead towards achieving accurate and plausible solutions. © SCRG Publication, 2013.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Tikhonov regularization",,,,,,,,,,"Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, I., Basri, R., 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image Using a Single Reference Face Shape (2011) Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 33, pp. 394-405. , IEEE Transactions on; Atick, J.J., Griffin, P.A., Redlich, A.N., Statistical approach to shape from shading: Reconstruction of three-dimensional face surfaces from single two-dimensional images (1996) Neural Computation, 8, pp. 1321-1340. , Aug 15; Zhang, R., Tsai, P.S., Cryer, J.E., Shah, M., Shape-from-shading: a survey (1999) Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 21, pp. 690-706. , IEEE Transactions on; Smith, W.A., Hancock, E.R., Recovering facial shape using a statistical model of surface normal direction (2006) Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 28, pp. 1914-1930. , IEEE Transactions on; Nandy, D., Ben-Arie, J., Shape from recognition: a novel approach for 3- D face shape recovery (2001) Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 10, pp. 206-217; Lin, C.T., Cheng, W.C., Liang, S.F., Neural-network-based adaptive hybrid-reflectance model for 3-D surface reconstruction (2005) Neural Networks, 16, pp. 1601-1615. , IEEE Transactions on; Nagai, T., Naruse, T., Ikehara, M., Kurematsu, A., HMM-based surface reconstruction from single images (2002) in Image Processing. 2002.

This paper describes a novel way to acquire the reasons and contexts behind the prioritization of criteria or alternatives, through a verification mechanism together with a set of logical rules. Essentially, a respondent is expected to visually verify the online responses against the reasons behind the prioritization of each pair of alternatives or criteria. A rule-based approach is then adopted to validate and display the inconsistent responses. Each respondent is expected to correct all detected inconsistency by recording the appropriate reasons and contexts in some concept maps. The resulting verification mechanism could be further enhanced and used as an intelligent organizational knowledge creation and maintenance framework for personalizing a group decision support setting. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Criteria prioritization; Logical inconsistency detection; Verification mechanism","Concept maps; Group decision supports; Inconsistency detection; Logical rules; Not given; Organizational knowledge; Prioritization; Rule-based approach; Decision support systems; Surveys",,,,,,,,,"Siraj, S., Preference elicitation from pairwise comparisons in multi-criteria decision making (2011) Thesis Doctor of Philosophy School of Computer Science University of Manchester; Saaty, T., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , New York McGraw-Hill; Mateu, A.V., A multiple criteria decision making method for heterogeneous data sets PhD Thesis Department of Computer Science and Mathematics Universitat Politechnica De Catalunya; Lida, Y., The number of circular triads in a pairwise comparison matrix and a consistency test in AHP (2009) Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan, 52, pp. 174-185; Acovou, C.L., A comparison of pairs, triads and quads in multi-attribute decision making (2010) International Journal of Strategic Decision Sciences (IJSDS), 1, pp. 1-24; Keri, G., On qualitatively consistent, transitive and contradictory judgment matrices emerging from multi attribute decision procedures (2010) Central European Journal of Operations Research, 19, pp. 215-224; Yadav, R., Khoo, V.K.T., Lim, C.Y., Automatic inconsistency detection for online responses (2011) International Conference On Software and Information Engineering, pp. 657-664; Nonaka, I., Takeuchi, H., (1995) The Knowledge-Creating Company, , Oxford University Press New York); Szczypinska, A., Piotrowski, E.W., Inconsistency of the judgment matrix in the AHP method and the decision maker's knowledge (2009) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 388, pp. 907-915; Asahi, T., Ikegami, T., Fukuzumi, S.I., A Usability evaluation method applying AHP and treemap techniques (2009) Human-Computer Interaction New Trends, 5610, pp. 195-203; Condon, E., Golden, B., Wasil, E., Visualizing group decisions in the analytic hierarchy process (2003) Computers & Operations Research, 30, pp. 1435-1445; ́Enez, J.M.M.-J., Salvador, M., TuŕOn, A., Group preference structures in AHP - group decision making (2005) 2nd Compositional Data Analysis Workshop Girona, , October; Survey, K., (2012), 15. , www.Kwiksurveys.com, Kwik Surveys: Offical free online survey & questionnaire tool Available at, Accessed on May; Kandasamy, W.B.V., Smarandache, F., (2003) Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps, , Xiquan Phoenix; Smarandache, F., Neutrosophy, a new branch of philosophy (2002) An International Journal Multiple-Valued Logic, 8, pp. 297-384; Lim, C.Y., Khoo, V.K.T., Belaton, B., A methodology for deliberating prediction criteria (2011) Applied Mechanics and Materials, 130-134, pp. 1758-1761","Lim, C.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualizing the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. The two main issues that arise when comparing these data is to know how to efficiently and effectively compare phylogenetic trees, and how to visually present the results of the comparison. The primary approach is to present a new framework for tree structure visualization techniques that will display pairs of trees ""face to face"" with leaf nodes aligned. The results show that a combination of automatic and manual rearrangement is often effective in rapidly generating an arrangement that facilitates tree comparison, even for quite large trees. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Bioinformatics; Phylogenetic tree visualization; Visual comparison","Face to face; Phylogenetic trees; Tree comparison; Tree structures; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Visualization technique; Data visualization; Trees (mathematics); Bioinformatics",,,,,,,,,"Hall, B.G., (2007) Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy: A How-To Manual, , Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates Inc; Munzner, T., Guimbretiere, F., Tasiran, S., Zhang, L., Zhou, Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility (2003) ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22 (3), pp. 453-462; Shneiderman, B., Tree visualization with tree-maps: A 2-D space-filling approach (1992) ACM Transactions on Graphics, 11 (1), pp. 92-99; Lamping, J., Rao, R., The hyperbolic browser: A focus + context technique for visualizing large hierarchies (1995) Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, 7 (1), pp. 33-55; Schulz, H.J., Schumann, H., Hadlak, S., Pointbased tree representation-a new approach for large hierarchies (2009) Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, pp. 81-88. , In; Stover, B., Muller, K., TreeGraph 2: Combining and visualizing evidence from different phylogenetic analyses (2010) BMC Bioinformatics, 11 (7), pp. 7-16; Wan, Z.W.M.N., Talib, A.Z., Belaton, B., (2011) A New Framework for Phylogenetic Tree Visualization, pp. 348-359. , H.

The learning models are trained from a set of examples to reach a state where the model will be able to predict the correct output for other examples. PCA-based statistical modeling is a popular technique for modeling 3D faces, which can be used for 3D face reconstruction. The capability of 3D face leaning models in depicting new 3D faces can be considered as the representational power (RP) of the model. This paper focuses on examining the effect of the sample size (number of training faces) on the accuracy of the 3D face shape reconstruction from a small set of feature points. It also aims to visualize the effect of the training sample size on the RP of PCA-based models. Experiments were designed and carried out on testing and training data of the USF Human ID 3D database. We found that although the representational power increases with a larger training sample size, the accuracy of reconstruction is limited by the number of the feature points used. This means that by reconstructing faces from a limited number of feature points, a definite number of examples are sufficient to build a satisfactory 3D face model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Regularization; Sample size; Statistical face modeling","Face recognition; Information technology; Sampling; 3D face reconstruction; Face modeling; PCA; Regularization; Sample sizes; Three dimensional",,,,,,,,,"Blanz, V., Mehl, A., Vetter, T., Seidel, H.-P., A Statistical Method for Robust 3D Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Data (2004) Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium On 3D Data Processing, Visualization, and Transmission, , IEEE Computer Society; Luximon, Y., Ball, R., Justice, L., The 3D Chinese head and face modeling (2012) Computer- Aided Design, 44, pp. 40-47; Widanagamaachchi, W.N., Dharmaratne, A.T., 3D Face Reconstruction from 2D Images (2008) Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, pp. 365-371. , DICTA 2008; Martin, D.L., Yingfeng, Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person (2009) Pattern Recogn.

A case study on USF Human ID 3D database has been used to study these effect. We found that, if the test face is from the training set, then any set of any number greater than or equal to the number of training faces can reconstruct exact 3D face. If the test face does not belong to the training set, it will hardly reconstruct the exact 3D face using 3D PCA-based models. However, it could reconstruct an approximate face shape depending on the number of feature points and the weighting factor. Furthermore, the accuracy of reconstruction by a large number of feature points (> 150) is relatively the same in all cases even with different locations of points on the face. The regularized algorithm has also been tested to reconstruct 3D face shapes from a number of feature points selected manually from real 2D face images.

It has vital applications in medical and biological imaging. Nevertheless, it is inherently open to cluttered classification results. It suffers from overlapping transfer function values and lacks a sufficiently powerful voxel parsing mechanism for object distinction. In this work, we are proposing an image processing based approach towards enhancing ray casting technique for object distinction process. The rendering mode is modified to accommodate masking information generated by a K-means based hybrid segmentation system. An effective set of image processing techniques are creatively employed in construction of a generic segmentation system capable of generating object membership information.

The capability of the model to depict a new 3D face depends on the exemplar faces in the training set. Although a few 3D face databases are available to the research community and they have been used for 3D face modeling, there is little work done on rigorous statistical analysis of the models built from these databases. The common factors that are generally concerned are the size of the training set and the different choice of the examples in the training set. In this paper, a case study on USF Human ID 3D database, one of the most popular databases in the field, has been used to study the effect of these factors on the representational power.We found that: 1) the size of the training set increase, the more accurate the model can represent a new face; 2) the increase of the representational power tends to slow down in an exponential manner and achieves saturity when the number of faces is greater than 250. These findings are under assumptions that the 3D faces in the database are randomly chosen and can represent different races and gender with neutral expressions. This analysis can be applied to the database which includes expressions too.A regularized 3D face reconstruction algorithm has also been tested to find out how feature points selection affects the accuracy of the 3D face reconstruction based on the PCA-model. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"3D database; 3D face modeling; 3D face reconstruction; 3D faces; Common factors; Principle component analysis; Research communities; Training sets; Database systems; Face recognition; Principal component analysis; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional",,,,,,,,,"Amin, S.H., Gillies, D., Analysis of 3d face reconstruction (2007) Image Analysis and Processing, pp. 413-418. , ICIAP 2007. 14th International Conference on; Dalong, J., Yuxiao, H., Shuicheng, Y., Lei, Z., Hongjiang, Z., Wen, G., Efficient 3D reconstruction for face recognition (2005) Pattern Recogn., 38 (6), pp. 787-798; Elyan, E., Ugail, H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations (2007) JCP, pp. 1-8; Fanany, M.I., Ohno, M., Kumazawa, I., (2002) Face Reconstruction from Shading Using Smooth Projected Polygon Representation NN; Iain, M., Jing, X., Simon, B., 2D vs. 3D Deformable Face Models: Representational Power, Construction, and Real-Time Fitting (2007) Int.

Since every company is unique, without the assistance of some methodologies and tools, decision makers encounter great difficulties in conducting predictive analysis, especially in the deliberation and prioritization of new prediction criteria derived from the publicly available unstructured information. This paper proposes a unique methodology which attempts to integrate the personalization and visualization of new prediction criteria. The challenging iterative tasks are achieved through a rule-based inconsistency detection triad-based comparison algorithm, supported by sophisticated visual displays of the relative importance among the prediction criteria. It is hoped that the proposed methodology will intuitively support the decision makers in exploring and deliberating new criteria for making better predictions. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Inconsistency detection; Personalization; Predictive analysis; Unstructured information; Visualization","Customer need; Decision makers; Economic downturn; Emerging products; Inconsistency detection; Personalizations; Predictive analysis; Prioritization; Relative importance; Rule based; Technology trends; Unstructured information; Visual display; Decision making; Electronics engineering; Flow visualization; Industry; Visualization; Forecasting",,,,,,,,,"Shuttleworth, M., (2009) Prediction in Research: Scientists and Soothsayers, , http://www.experiment-resources.com/prediction-in-research.html, [Accessed on October 4, 2010]; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Competing on analytics: The new science of winning (2007) Boston Massachusetts, , Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation; Eckerson, W.W., Predictive analytics extending the value of your data warehousing investment (2007) TDWI Best Practices Report First Quarter 2007; Spangler, S.W., Kreulen, J.T., (2008) Mining the Talk - Unlocking the Business Value in Unstructured Information, , IBM Press, Pearson Education, Inc; Shmueli, G., Koppius, O., The challenge of prediction in information systems research (2008) Social Science Research Network Working Paper Series; Siegel, E., (2010) Seven Reasons You Need Predictive Analytics Today, , http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/blog/?p=274, [Accessed on October 30, 2010]; (2009) SPSS: 10 Really Good Reasons to Use Predictive Analytics, , http://whitepapers.prweekus.com/whitepaper4872, [Accessed on October 1, 2010]; (2006) SPSS: Increase Customer Value with Predictive Analytics: How Predictive Analytics Benefits Gaming Organizations, , http://www.predictiveanalyticsinsight.com/articles/gaming.pdf, SPSS Executive Brief, [Accessed on May 15, 2010]; Ramakrishnan, R., Madure, R., (2008) Predictive Analytics: Extending BI Infrastructure, , http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2008_114/ -10002307-1.html, [Accessed on May 31, 2010]; Liu, Y., Agichtein, E., You've got answers: Towards personalized models for predicting success in community question answering (2008) Proceedings of the 46th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technologies, , Columbus, Ohio; Spohrer, J., (2004) Service Science An Emerging Multidiscipline to Accelerate the Coevolution of Business-Technology-Work Innovations, , www.accelerating.org/ac2004/slides/AC2004(Spohrer).ppt, [Accessed on May 06, 2011]; Yadav, R., Khoo, V.K.T., Lim, C.Y., Automatic inconsistency detection for online responses (2011) International Conference on Software and Information Engineering (ICSIE 2011), , Kuala Lumpur, 2011, in press; (2007) Viz.Biz: Introduction to Visualization, , http://demo.elearninglab.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=5, [Accessed on May 25, 2011]; (2007), http://www.visualliteracy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html, [Accessed on May 25, 2011]","Lim, C.Y.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia; email: lcy09_com005p@student.usm.my",,"Hefei University of Technology",,"2011 3rd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering, ICMEE 2011","23 September 2011 through 25 September 2011","Hefei",87364,16609336,9783037852866,,,"English","Appl.

In real world cases, an increasing number of student enrolments, variety of courses throw in the growing challenge in the research with a wider range of constraints. Many optimization problems are concerned with the best feasible solution with minimum execution time of algorithms. The aim of this paper is to propose rough sets methods to investigate the Carter datasets. Two rough sets (RS) approaches are used for the data analysis. Firstly, the discretization process (DP) returns a partition of the value sets into intervals. Secondly the rough sets Boolean reasoning (RSBR) achieves the best decision table on the large data instances. The rough sets classified datasets are experimented with an examination scheduler. The improvements of the solutions on Car-s-91 and Car-f-91 datasets are reported. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Datasets; Discretization; Examination timetabling; Rough sets","Academic institutions; Boolean reasoning; Data sets; Discretization process; Discretizations; Examination timetabling; Execution time; Feasible solution; Large data; Optimization problems; Rough set; Student enrolment; Value sets; Data processing; Decision tables; Intelligent computing; Teaching; Rough set theory",,,,,,,,,"Burke, E.K., Elliman, D.G., Ford, P.H., Weare, R.F., Examination Timetabling in British Universities (1996) LNCS, 1153, pp. 76-90. , Burke, E., Ross, P.

In this study, we investigate one vital component to extract crest lines, the gradient of the maximal curvature. Most of geometry properties required to calculate crest lines can be obtained from the volume data during the process of the surface construction using implicit surface polygonizer. Nevertheless the gradient of the maximal curvature cannot be obtained due to the nature of the surface construction algorithm. Hence we proposed three weight function based methods in accordance with the knowledge of the surface mesh.

It examines current tree visualization and comparison techniques and proposes a new framework that display fully resolved binary trees in a way that facilitates their visual comparison. A prototype interactive tool named VCPT (Visual Comparison of Phylogenetic trees) is developed to explore the proposed framework and issues in regard to visual comparison and manipulation of phylogenetic trees.

In real world cases, an increasing number of student enrolments, variety of courses throw in the growing challenge in the research with a wider range of constraints. Many optimization problems are concerned with the best feasible solution with minimum execution time of algorithms. The aim of this paper is to propose rough sets methods to investigate the Carter datasets. Two rough sets (RS) approaches are used for the data analysis. Firstly, the discretization process(DP) returns a partition of the value sets into intervals. Secondly the rough sets Boolean reasoning (RSBR) achieves the best decision table on the large data instances. The rough sets classified datasets are experimented with an examination scheduler. The improvements of the solutions on Car-s-91 and Car-f-91 datasets are reported. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","discretization; Examination Timetabling; Rough sets","Academic institutions; Boolean reasoning; Data sets; Discretization process; Discretizations; Examination timetabling; Execution time; Feasible solution; Large data; Optimization problems; Rough set; Student enrolment; Value sets; Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Data reduction; Decision tables; Teaching; Rough set theory",,,,,,,,,"Burke, E.K., Elliman, D.G., Ford, P.H., Weare, R.F., Examination timetabling in British Universities - A survey (1996) LNCS, 1153, pp. 76-90. , Burke, E., Ross, P.

In this paper, we look into the knowledge abstractions techniques to reduce the complexity of problem solving for university examination timetabling problem. The methods consists of recapitulate, visual analysis heuristic (VAH), and specification. The recapitulation groups the successive components, thus reducing the size of the problem. The clustering heuristics, partitioning the problem into easy and difficult components interacting through abstracted pools. The hierarchy of pools allows the user to intervene in conflict resolution at the most appropriate level of abstraction. The specification simplify the decouple components to aid the user in assessing the stiffness of the problem. We propose an algorithm that interleaves these processes. The combinations of these three techniques are evaluated with the real-world examination timetabling room allocation problem scenario. The merits of our approach are minimizing the need for backtracking, provides interactive visual models framework to understand the conflict resolution and offering a comprehensive direction to feasible solution.","Conflict resolution; Examination timetabling; Visualization","Clustering heuristics; Conflict Resolution; Educational institutions; Examination timetabling; Feasible solution; Knowledge abstraction; Level of abstraction; Scheduling systems; Abstracting; Automation; Flow visualization; Heuristic methods; Lakes; Specifications; Scheduling",,,,,,,,,"Al-Betar, M., Khader, A.T., Gani, T.A., A harmony search algorithm for university course timetabling (2008) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling, , Burke, E.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualising the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. There are many research areas (such as biology, linguistics, chemistry and computer science) that use the tree as a basic data structure. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. When dealing with these sorts of data, biologists often have to deal with multiple trees generated from the same set of data. The biologists have to compare these trees in order to get a better understanding of these data. This paper aims to explore techniques to visualise the differences between two phylogenetic trees. Specifically, an application has been developed, named VCPT (Visual Comparison of Phylogenetic Trees) that implements for a new algorithm and display-based approaches that will help in visualising the similarity and differences between the phylogenetic trees. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.","Bioinformatics Visualisation; Phylogenetic Trees; Tree Structured Data","Multiple trees; Phylogenetic trees; Research areas; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Bioinformatics; Biology; Data structures; Genes; Plant extracts; Visualization; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,,,,,"Munzner, T., Guimbretiere, F., Tasiran, S., Zhang, L., Zhou, Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility (2003) ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22 (3), pp. 453-462. , 2003; Irwin, R., (2003) Biology Lectures: Introduction to Systematics, , http://www.utm.edu/~rirwin/391Cladistics.htm, [Online]; The willi henning society About Willi Henning, , http://www.cladistics.org/about/hennig.html, [Online]; Wan Zainon, W.N., Calder, P., Visualising phylogenetic trees (2006) Proc. 7th Australasian User Interface Conference, pp. 145-152; Maddison, D.R., The Tree of Life: Web Project, , http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html, [Online]; Lipscomb, D., (1998) Basics of Cladistic Analysis, , George Washington University, Washington D.C; Carrizo, S.F., Phylogenetic trees: An information visualisation perpective (2004) Proc. 2nd Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference, pp. 315-320; Thollesson, M., (2001) Phylogenetic Inference of Evolutionary Relationships, , http://www.lcb.uu.se/course/ugsbr/PhyloIntro.html, [Online]; Roderic, D.M., (1993) Component 2.0-User Guide, , http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/cplite/Manual.html, [Online]; Mesquite Manual, , http:/mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/manual.html, [Online]; Makarenkov, V., T-REX: Reconstructing and visualizing phylogenetic trees and reticulation networks (2001) Bioinformatics, 17 (7), pp. 664-668; Bryant, D., (1997) Building Trees, Hunting for Trees and Comparing Trees, , PhD. thesis, University of Canterbury, New Zealand; Lozano, A., Pinter, R.Y., Rokhlenko, O., Valiente, G., Ziv-Ukelson, M., Seeded tree alignment (2008) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), 5 (4), pp. 503-513; Amenta, N., Klinger, J., Case study: Visualizing sets of evolutionary trees (2002) Proc.

Firstly, instead of using uniform parameterization in RSC, a modified inverse chord length method is proposed for Bspline parameterisation. It takes the advantage that inverse chord length has much better controllability (i.e. assigning more control points to densely sampled or high variation areas) over other B-spline parameterization methods, and further improves its fitting accuracy by automatically determining the value of the exponential parameter and taking the squareroot of the measurements in the original method. Secondly, to further improve the registration accuracy, a uniform scaling factor is incorporated in RSC for the transformation. An iterative algorithm facilitated with some heuristic initial values and stopping criteria is proposed to recover all the transformations alternatively with a fast convergence rate. Experiments on real skull showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2010 IADIS.","B-spline parameterization; Controllability; Modified inverse chord length; Rigid Super-Curves; Scaling factor","B-spline; B-spline parameterization; Chord lengths; Control point; Fast convergence rate; Fitting accuracy; Initial values; Iterative algorithm; Modified inverse chord length; Parameterisation; Parameterization method; Registration accuracy; Rigid registration; Rigid Super-Curves; Scaling factor; Scaling factors; Square-root; Stopping criteria; Algorithms; Computer vision; Controllability; Convergence of numerical methods; Imaging systems; Parameterization; Three dimensional; Virtual reality; Visualization; Splines",,,,,,,,,"Berar, M., Desvignes, M., Bailly, G., Payan, Y., 3D Meshes Registration: Application to Statistical Skull Model (2004) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3212, pp. 100-107; Besl, P.J., McKay, N.D., A method for registration of 3D shapes (1992) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14 (2), pp. 239-256; Ding, C.S., Belaton, B., Estimating extremal planes to extract crest lines from volumetric data (2009) Visual Informatics: Bridging Research and Practice, IVIC 2009, pp. 748-758. , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Huang, Z., Cohen, F.S., Affine-invariant B-spline moments for curve matching (1996) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 5 (10), pp. 1473-1480. , PII S105771499607193X; Hutton, T.J., Automated registration of 3D faces using dense surfaces models (2003) British Machine Vision Conference, pp. 439-448. , Norwich, UK; Liao, I.Y., Skull registration using rigid super-curves (2009) Proceedings of the 6th International on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization (CGIV), pp. 475-479. , Tianjin, China; Lim, C.-G., A universal parametrization in B-spline curve and surface interpolation (1999) Computer Aided Geometric Design, 16 (5), pp. 407-422; Maintz, J.B.A., Van den Elsen, P.A., Viergever, M.A., Registration of SPECT and MR brain images using a fuzzy surface (1996) Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2710, pp. 821-829. , DOI 10.1117/12.237988; Park, H., Lee, J.-H., B-spline curve fitting based on adaptive curve refinement using dominant points (2007) CAD Computer Aided Design, 39 (6), pp. 439-451. , DOI 10.1016/j.cad.2006.12.006, PII S0010448507000024; Sukmarg, O., Rao, K.R., B-spline curve representation of segmented object in MPEG compressed domain (2000) WPMC 2000, pp. 1-4. , Bangkok, Thailand; Suwardhi, D., Coordinate system integration for craniofacial database from multimodal devices (2007) PROC.

The goal of information visualization is unveiling of large amounts of data or abstract data set using visual presentation. With this knowledge the main goal is to develop a 2D presentation of information on movies from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) as our movie search engine. The aim is to amplify the perception of users over the retrieval environment while preserving the output quality at an acceptable meaningful level. Visualization ideas deal with visualization of information seeking results. These visualization techniques have been collected from the literature on how to map the results of the information retrieval process. We propose a 2D visual interface for mapping collections of movies and exploration of their related information to maximize density of needed information in a single page. For this purpose, we introduce a movie categorization scheme to help users in navigating through the movies information. The traditional style (interface) of clicking a link to view details of documents in most of the search engines like the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) as our movie search engine to find information is very uninteresting and tedious. This is because when clicking a particular link the user's focus is shifted to the new page, and if the information presented is not to their interest, they will need to switch back to the movie's search results. The key contribution is thus a reasonable mapping result of a query on an actor/actress movie database displayed in just one page that can amplify visual perception of retrieved movies. This theory of data graphics interface focuses on maximization of the density of useful pertinent information with respect to users query in a screen page. This method of grouping of information needs some data extraction algorithms by parsing and crawling the IMDB web pages that are useful to retrieve important movies information. Our graphical-based visualization provides a correct understanding of information that users can view information without reading them. A qualitative experimental test comparing the classic (traditional) interface of the IMDB and visual interface was conducted.","2D visual interface; Contribution; Experimental test; Extraction algorithm; IMDB movies' information visualization; Retrieval system (IMDB); Visualization",,,,,,,,,,"Hearst, M.A., Karadi, C., Cat-a-cone: an interactive interface for specifying searches and viewing retrieval results using a large category (1997) Proceedings of the 20th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, pp. 246-255. , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, ACM; Shneiderman, B., Tree Visualization with tree-maps: A 2D space filling approach (1990) ACM Trans.

The method that restitutes the rigid transformation between two sets of fully matched curves is propounded. RSC exploits the non-ambiguity of B-Spline representation of supercurves whilst overcoming the inability of super-curves to restore rigid transformations. A further contribution of this study is a two-stage algorithm based on RSC which registers two sets of partially matched curves under a rigid transformation. The algorithm improves the robustness over feature based methods by considering the structure rather than individual points of the curve. Experimental results on CT scanned skull data show that proposed algorithm is more robust and accurate at restoring the rigid transformation between two sets of crest line data compared with Iterated Closest Point and Super Curves methods. © 2009 IEEE.","Crest lines; Curve matching; Iterated-closestpoint; Medical image registration; Rigid transformation; Super-curves","B-spline representation; Crest lines; Curve matching; Feature-based method; Medical image registration; Rigid transformations; Two-stage algorithm; Algorithms; Computer graphics; Image registration; Splines; Visualization; Graph theory",,,,,,,,,"Gueziec, A., Ayache, N., New developments on geometric hashing for curve matching (1993) IEEE Conf. on CVPR, pp. 703-704. , INRIA SA; Thirion, J.P., Gourdon, A., (1992) The 3D Marching Lines Algorithm and Its Application to Crest Lines Extraction, 1672. , Rapport de Recherche INRIA; Pajdla, T., Van Gool, L., Matching of 3-D Curves using Semidifferential Invariants (1995) Fifth.

The segmentation takes place by initially performing K-means clustering and then recombination. K-means algorithm uses RGB color values, diagonal busyness factor (sum of color differences among central and diagonal pixels) and epsilon spatiality factor (sum of Euclidian distances of pixels belonging to a particular cluster from their cluster center) as its clustering parameters in order to produce optionally compact or loose clusters representative of inherent color and texture. In addition, three different distribution methods are introduced to initialize central points and therefore improve the clustering accuracy. The methods are evenly spaced values, random values and evenly spaced samples respectively. In evenly spaced values, clusters (central points) are evenly distributed along the range of RGB colors available with in the image so that each cluster may partially represent a sub range of the total range of colors available with in the image. In random values, the distribution of clusters (central points) is not even. To define a central point an RGB color is randomly selected from the range of RGB colors available with in the image. In evenly spaced samples the distribution of clusters (central points) is based on X and Y (width and height) coordinates rather than color. To obtain an even distribution, total number of image pixels are calculated and then divided by the number of clusters (central points). Recombination is performed by scanning the neighborhood of each pixel in eight connected directions and determining the class (cluster) to which majority of neighbors belong. The class of central pixel (the pixel whose neighborhood is scanned) is then changed to the class (cluster) that majority of neighbors belong. © 2009 IEEE.","Color; Image segmentation; K-means; Spatiality; Texture","Central point; Cluster centers; Clustering accuracy; Color difference; Color image segmentation; Color values; Different distributions; Distribution of cluster; Euclidian distance; General purpose; Image pixels; K-means; k-Means algorithm; K-means clustering; Number of clusters; Object extraction; Random values; RGB images; Segmentation system; Color; Computer graphics; Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Textures; Visualization; Pixels",,,,,,,,,"Luo, M., Ma, Y.F., Zhang, H.J., A spatial constrained K-means approach to image segmentation (2003) Proceedings of 4 Pacific Rim Conference on Multimedia, pp. 738-742. , IEEE, December; Shapiro, L.G., Stockman, G.C., (2001) Computer Vision, pp. 279-325. , New Jersey, Prentice Hall; A Tutorial on Clustering Algorithms, , http://www.polimi.it, Politecnico Di Milano University Press.

This study surveys isosurface construction methods, particularly in implicit surface polygonization using tracking partition. An investigation is conducted on the implementation of it. With reference of original Jules Bloomenthal's implementation, an extension of the implicit surface polygonization is developed with concern of real volumetric data. Rather than conventional methods, such as Marching Cubes and its variants, the method has advantages on time complexity, flexibility and is easy to implement. A brief comparison has been done among these methods. During the development, some practical issues, such as starting point placement, seed point generation, manifold surface, manifoldwith- boundary, are addressed. Possible solutions of these problems are suggested. Some ideas on enhancement of the method are conveyed at end of this paper for further work. © 2009 IEEE.","Implicit polygonization; Isosurface extraction; Visualization","Conventional methods; Implicit polygonization; Implicit surface polygonization; Isosurface construction; Isosurface extraction; Marching cube; ON time; Possible solutions; Practical issues; Scientific visualizations; Seed point; Volumetric data; Computer graphics; Volumetric analysis; Visualization",,,,,,,,,"Shahidi, R., Surface rendering versus volume rendering in medical imaging: Techniques and applications (1996) IEEE Visualization Proceedings of the 7th conference on Visualization, pp. 439-440. , San Francisco, California, United States; Lorensen, W., Cline, H., Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm (1987) ACM Computer Graphics, 21 (4), pp. 163-169. , July; Bloomenthal, J., Polygonization of Implicit Surfaces (1988) Computer Aided Geometric Design, 5, pp. 341-355; Shirley, P., A polygonal approximation to direct scalar volume rendering (1990) ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics archive, 24 (5), pp. 63-70. , November; Gregory M.

These processes are interrelated with one another for any heuristic based, evolutionary algorithm guided timetabling systems.

Our solution requires neither implicit surface definition nor the use of non-simple rays. Points are simply treated as disk primitives. To prevent shading artifacts due to the use of disk representation, each ray is intersected with a few disks, and the intersection results interpolated. Further, to speed up the ray-object search, we adapt the KD-tree with bounding spheres structure applied in the QSplat point splatting system (Rusinkiewicz and Levoy 2000). Our prototype implementation is generally competitive compared to previous point set ray tracers. Further it demonstrates considerable speedup over a point set ray tracer based on a conventional KD-tree, while producing images with acceptable ray-traced quality.","Point primitives; Ray tracing","Disk representation; Fast ray tracing; Implicit surfaces; Kd-tree; Point primitives; Point set; Point-based geometry; Prototype implementations; Speed-ups; Splatting; Computer graphics; Disks (structural components); Elementary particle sources; Geometry; Software prototyping; Ray tracing",,,,,,,,,"Adamson, A., Alexa, M., Ray Tracing Point Set Surfaces (2003) SMI'03:Proceedings of the Shape Modeling International 2003, p. 272; Chen B., Nguyen M.X.

Lance Spitzner of the Honeynet Project introduced the concept of honeypots. A honeypot is in essence a decoy server, which has no real or strategic value and is only setup to attract crackers towards it. The idea is to trap the crackers and learn cracking techniques from them. Rapid increase in unauthorized intrusions over the Internet provides a great motivation to explore honeypots at a greater depth. We will provide analysis on TCP based denial of service attack carried out on Symantec Decoy Server based honeypot. These results highlight the importance of honeypot as a tool of learning and preventing future intrusions. © 2005 IEEE.","Denial of service attack; Honeypots; Symantec Decoy Server","Computer crime; Internet; Network protocols; Servers; Denial of service attack; Honeypots; Intrusions; Symantec Decoy Server; Packet networks",,,,,,,,,"Lau, F., Stuart, R.H., Smith, M.H., Trajovic, L., (2000) Distributed Denial of Service Attacks, , http://www.ensc.sfu.ca/~ljilja/./ papers/smc00.pdf; Bakhtiar Nizamani, A., Network Forensics using Honeynets (2003) Final Year Degree, pp. 15-16. , Thesis at University Tenaga Nasional, pp; Spitzner, L., (2002) Honeypots - Definitions and Value of Honeypots, , http://secinf.net/honeypots/ Honeypots_Definitions_and_Value_of_Honeypots.html; Symantec Manuals, Symantec Decoy Server Implementation Guide, July 2003; Spitzner, L., (2003) Frequently Asked Questions, , http://www.honeynet.org/misc/faq.html, Project HoneyNet; CERT® Advisory CA-2001-19, Code Red Worm Exploiting Buffer Overflow In US Indexing Service DLL, http://www.cert.org/ advisories/CA-2001-19.html, 2001; CERT® Incident Note IN-2001-09, Code Red II: Another Worm Exploiting Buffer Overflow In IIS Indexing Service DLL, http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2001-09.html, 2001; Moore, D., Shannon, C., Brown, J., (2002) Code-Red: A case study on the spread and victims of an Internet worm, , http://citeseer.ist.psu. edu/check/2117759; (2001) Cumulative Patch for IIS, , http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-044.mspx, Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-044; (2000) Steps for Recovering from a UNIX or NT System Compromise, , http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/win-UNIX- system_compromise.html, CERT® Coordination Center","Nizamani, A.B.; College of Information Technology, , 43009 Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia; email: nizamani@uniten.edu.my",,"Institute of Business Administration IBA;Microsoft;Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, PTCL;Inbox Corp;Intel",,"1st International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICICT 2005","27 August 2005 through 28 August 2005","Karachi",69266,,0780394216; 9780780394216,,,"English","Proc. 1st Int.

This research will examine the effects of weakly chosen password-keys on the security of block ciphers. A new hybrid optimization heuristic cryptanalytic attack (Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm) is used to conduct an intelligent key-search attack on classical ciphers and modern ciphers. The algorithm chosen to represent modern block ciphers is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES is an algebraic product cipher which combines elements of substitution and transposition, Therefore, the primarily aims of this paper is to study the effects of an optimization heuristic cryptanalytic attack on block cipher. © 2005 IEEE.","Cryptanalysis; Cryptographic ciphers; Heuristic search","Algebra; Algorithms; Cryptography; Optimization; Security of data; Cryptanalysis; Cryptographic ciphers; Heuristic search; Heuristic methods",,,,,,,,,"Gründlingh, W.R., Van Vuuren, J.H., Using genetic Algorithms to Break a Simple Cryptographic Cipher, , http://www.apprendre-en- ligne.net/bibliotheque/genetic.ps; Schneier, B., (1996) Applied Cryptography- Protocols, Algorithms, and Scarce Code in C, , Second Edition.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and sift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic. © 2005 IEEE.","Alert correlation; Data quality; Intrusion detection; Security","Algorithms; Computational methods; Computer system firewalls; Reliability; Routers; Alert correlation; Data quality; Intrusion detection; Security of data",,,,,,,,,"(2005), http://www.arcsight.com/product.htm, Arcsight Enterprise Security Management, Product Information, 27 July; Feinstein, B., Matthews, G., White, J., The Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP) (2005) IETF IDWG, , http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/ draft-ietf-idwg-beepidxp07.txt, 27 July; CERT/CC Advisories, http://www.cert.org/advisories/ (27 July 2005); Kruegel, C., Robertson, W., Alert Verification - Determining the Success of Intrusion Attempts Proc.

These efforts decrease the volume of the security data, marginally reduce the false positive rate, and improve the attack-detection rate. Although the results of these efforts have been encouraging, there are still weaknesses partly due to data quality problems. This paper works on the premise that a quality input data should in theory help in producing good results. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose an intrusion alert quality framework that addresses alert preparation stage for high-level reasoning by enriching and enhancing the alerts with quality parameters, and then encoding these enriched alerts in the IDMEF format.
