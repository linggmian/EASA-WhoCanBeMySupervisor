Currently, the number of active cases in Malaysia is less than 50% of the accumulated points. This paper will present the most accurate machine learning model to predict the number of new possibilities for 01/04-15/04/2020 (15 days). Notably, four machine learning models and one traditional statistical prediction analysis ARIMA have been trained, tested and evaluated. The results are compared to the actual data. We found that the multilayer perceptron neural network has outperformed all models in estimating the number of new positive cases in a specific time range. However, the ARIMA model performs better in predicting recovered and death cases than the machine learning models. We have applied the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute predictive error (MAPE) evaluation metrics to assess the model performance. The proposed approach can be viewed as a feasible alternative to forecast the new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, where there is no constant seasonal trend and no past data sources for comparison. The proposed methodology is easily tractable and computationally efficient to demonstrate the number of new cases that are useful and beneficial in terms of control management. © 2021 IEEE.",ARIMA; Machine learning; Neural network; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Time-series prediction,Autoregressive moving average model; Forecasting; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Computationally efficient; Control management; Evaluation metrics; Feasible alternatives; Machine learning models; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Root mean square errors; Statistical prediction; Machine learning,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors appreciate all emergency services personnel, nurses, doctors, and other hospital staff for their efforts in combating the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia.

One cannot simply adopt any MBD outbreak prediction system to their study area due to specific issues such as insufficient data and the arduousness of obtaining particular datasets. Manipulating open-source data available from the Internet might be scarce, unstructured, inadequate, irrelevant, and could merely be noise. Hence, the machine learning predictive power will be affected directly.

This study proposes a data-driven approach that allows for rock mass classification. Two machine learning (ML) classification models, namely random forest (RF) and extremely randomized tree (ERT), are employed to classify the rock mass conditions encountered in the Pahang-Selangor Raw Water Tunnel in Malaysia using tunnel boring machine (TBM) operating parameters. Due to imbalance of rock classes distribution, an oversampling technique was used to obtain a balanced training dataset for unbiased learning of the ML models. A five-fold cross-validation approach was used to tune the model hyperparameters and validation-set approach was used for the model evalua-tion. ERT achieved an overall accuracy of 95%, while RF achieved 94% accuracy, in rightly classifying rock mass conditions. The result shows that the proposed approach has the potential to identify and correctly classify ground conditions of a TBM, which allows for early problem detection and on-the-fly support system selection based on the identified ground condition. This study, which is part of an ongoing effort towards developing reliable models that could be incorporated into TBMs, shows the potential of data-driven approaches for on-the-fly classification of ground conditions ahead of a TBM and could allow for the early detection of potential construction problems. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we focus on high-dimensional multi-class imbalanced problems. The high dimensional and multi-class imbalanced problem has posed acute challenges for the conventional classifiers to effectively perform classification tasks on both the minority and majority classes. Numerous efforts have been devoted to addressing either high dimensionality dataset or class imbalance problems. Nonetheless, few methods have been proposed to address the intersection of multi-class imbalanced and high-dimensional problems concurrently due to their intricate interactions. This paper presents novel hybrid algorithms for feature selection with the high dimensional multi-class imbalanced problem using multiple filter-based rankers (MFR) and hybrid Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). The Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is incorporated into GOA. SA is used to enhance the best solution found by the GOA algorithm. The aim of using the SA here is to tackle the slow convergence and improve the exploitation by searching the high-quality regions found by the GOA. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving the classification performance in terms of area under the curve (AUC) compared to other well-known methods, which guarantees the ability of the proposed methods in searching the feature space and identifying very robust and discriminative features that best predict the minority class. © 2013 IEEE.",feature selection; Grasshopper optimization algorithm; high-dimensionality; hybrid filter-wrapper; imbalanced class distribution; multiple filter-based rankers; simulated annealing; tournament selection,Simulated annealing; Area under the curves; Class imbalance problems; Classification performance; Conventional classifier; Discriminative features; High-dimensional problems; Optimization algorithms; Simulated annealing algorithms; Feature extraction,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/8014084,This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014084.,"Sharifai, A.G., Zainol, Z., The correlation-based redundancy multiple-filter approach for gene selection (2020) Int.

Watermarking techniques are used for many applications such as ownership protection, which is a popular area of research as compared to others such as authentication and local temper localization. There are many image watermarking schemes that have been recently published based on the frequency domain as it can fulfill watermarking requirements such as high robustness and imperceptibility. Singular-value decomposition (SVD) is one of them and is used in many frequency transform-based image watermarking schemes due to its stability and mathematical simplicity. However, there are many schemes that lack robustness against malicious cyberattacks, whereby the watermarks are easy to detect and destroy. Consequently, the proposed watermarking schemes became more complicated and cannot resist various geometric and non-geometric attacks. Thus, there are many existing hybrid SVD-based image watermarking schemes found be insecure. As there is also a lack of in-depth reviews in this domain, the focus of this paper is the analysis of the state-of-the-art in hybrid SVD-based image watermarking. We perform efficiency comparisons to highlight various security problems, open issues, and research gaps. Based on our findings, we additionally provide some recommendations for the development of more robust schemes in the future. This paper provides essential information for researchers and practitioners alike to advance the field of image watermarking. © 2013 IEEE.",Embedding; extraction; frequency domain; image watermarking; singular-value decomposition (SVD),,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/8014074,"This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia, and in part by the Research University Grant under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014074.","Singh, A.K., (2015) Some New Techniques of Improved Wavelet Domain Watermarking OFR Medical Images, , Ph.D. dissertation, Dept.

This paper aims to develop a predictive model for suicide attempts among patients with depression using machine learning algorithms as well as presents a comparative study on single predictive models with ensemble predictive models for differentiating depressed patients with suicide attempts from non-suicide attempters. We applied and trained eight different machine learning algorithms using a dataset that consists of 75 patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder. A recursive feature elimination was used to reduce the features via three-fold cross validation. An ensemble predictive models outperformed the single predictive models. Voting and bagging revealed the highest accuracy of 92% compared to other machine learning algorithms. Our findings indicate that history of suicide attempt, religion, race, suicide ideation and severity of clinical depression are useful factors for prediction of suicide attempts. © The Author(s) 2021.",data mining; depressive disorder; machine learning; predictive model; suicidal behaviour,,,,,,"Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, IPS: USM Bridging Grant [304.PKOM.6316284]

This requires a personalized information delivery, which will effectively fix the problem. The process of personalizing information requires several major steps: (i) determine the attributes which will be used to interpret a person, (ii) selects an algorithm which will accurately and efficiently classify the person according to the retrieved background information, and (iii) recommends the correct information to rectify the particular misunderstanding. This research paper considers the first two steps. First, data regarding the knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices are determined from the established literature where some variables give a significant impact on the predictive model. In the second step, five performed machine learning algorithms were tested for the classification task. The result indicates that the use of support vector machine and decision tree algorithms provide the best performance in classifying the person’s understanding regarding the dengue fever. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

It becomes more demanding with limited samples but with a massive number of features (high dimensionality). The high dimensional and imbalanced data set has posed severe challenges in many real-world applications, such as biomedical data sets. Numerous researchers investigated either imbalanced class or high dimensional data sets and came up with various methods. Nonetheless, few approaches reported in the literature have addressed the intersection of the high dimensional and imbalanced class problem due to their complicated interactions. Lately, feature selection has become a well-known technique that has been used to overcome this problem by selecting discriminative features that represent minority and majority class. This paper proposes a new method called Robust Correlation Based Redundancy and Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (rCBR-BGOA); rCBR-BGOA has employed an ensemble of multi-filters coupled with the Correlation-Based Redundancy method to select optimal feature subsets. A binary Grasshopper optimisation algorithm (BGOA) is used to construct the feature selection process as an optimisation problem to select the best (near-optimal) combination of features from the majority and minority class. The obtained results, supported by the proper statistical analysis, indicate that rCBR-BGOA can improve the classification performance for high dimensional and imbalanced datasets in terms of G-mean and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance metrics. © 2020 by the authors.

It becomes more demanding with limited samples but with a massive number of features (high dimensionality). The high dimensional and imbalanced data set has posed severe challenges in many real-world applications, such as biomedical data sets. Numerous researchers investigated either imbalanced class or high dimensional data sets and came up with various methods. Nonetheless, few approaches reported in the literature have addressed the intersection of the high dimensional and imbalanced class problem due to their complicated interactions. Lately, feature selection has become a well-known technique that has been used to overcome this problem by selecting discriminative features that represent minority and majority class. This paper proposes a new method called Robust Correlation Based Redundancy and Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (rCBR-BGOA); rCBR-BGOA has employed an ensemble of multi-filters coupled with the Correlation-Based Redundancy method to select optimal feature subsets. A binary Grasshopper optimisation algorithm (BGOA) is used to construct the feature selection process as an optimisation problem to select the best (near-optimal) combination of features from the majority and minority class. The obtained results, supported by the proper statistical analysis, indicate that rCBR-BGOA can improve the classification performance for high dimensional and imbalanced datasets in terms of G-mean and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance metrics.",class-imbalanced dataset; Grasshopper optimisation algorithm; high dimensionality; multi-filter,"animal; genetic database; genomics; human; machine learning; measurement accuracy; procedures; statistical analysis; Animals; Data Accuracy; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Databases, Genetic; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning",,,,,,,,,,,NLM (Medline),,,,,20734425,,,32605144,English,Genes (Basel),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087396158

However, the false positive problem (FPP) is the main drawback of SVD-based watermarking schemes. The singular value is the main cause of FPP issues because it a fixed value that does not hold structural information of an image. In this paper, a new SVD-based image watermarking scheme that uses a chaotic map is proposed to overcome this issue. The secret key is first extracted from both the host and watermark image. This key is used to generate a new chaotic matrix and chaotic multiple scaling factors (CMSF) to increase the sensitivity of the proposed scheme. The watermark image is then transformed based on the chaotic matrix before being directly embedded into the singular value of the host image by using the CMSF. The extracted secret key is unique to the host and the watermark images, which improves security and overcomes FPP issues. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme fulfils all watermarking requirements in terms of robustness, imperceptibility, security, and payload. Furthermore, it achieves high robustness with different scaling factors, and outperforms several existing schemes. © 2013 IEEE.",Chaotic map; Image watermark; Integer wavelet transform; IWT; Singular value decomposition; SVD,Chaotic systems; Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Chaotic map; High robustness; Integer wavelet transforms; Scaling factors; Singular values; Structural information; Watermark images; Watermarking schemes; Image watermarking,,,,,FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1,This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Project FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.,"Kumar, C., Singh, A.K., Kumar, P., A recent survey on image water-marking techniques and its application in e-governance (2017) Multimedia Tools Appl., 77 (3), pp. 3597-3622. , Sep; Pan, J.-S., Huang, H.-C., Jain, L.C., (2004) Intelligent Watermarking Tech-niques, 7. , Singapore: World Scientific; Huang, H.-C., (2009) Information Hiding Application, 227. , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Bal, S.N., Nayak, M.R., Sarkar, S.K., On the implementation of a secured watermarking mechanism based on cryptography and bit pairs matching J.

Various methods have been proposed for gene selection; however, most existing methods predominantly focused on selecting relevant gene subsets. However, the selected genes often comprised redundant genes in the training data, which may reduce the performance and increase the complexity of the learning algorithm. This paper proposes a Correlation-Based Redundancy Multiple Filter Approach (CBRMFA). Three filter methods are employed to select the relevant genes with diverse classification ability. The top N ranking genes with the highest-ranking scores are combined to form a new ranking list. The Correlation-Based Redundancy is utilised to eliminate redundant genes. A wrapper approach, sequential forward search approach is used to select the optimal gene subsets. Experimental results show that our proposed CBRMFA had achieved outstanding results in terms of three performance measures compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Correlation-based redundancy; Ensemble method; Gene selection; Microarray data set; Multi-filter,,,,,,,,"Alarcón-Paredes, A., Alonso, G.A., Cabrera, E., Cuevas-Valencia, R., Simultaneous gene selection and weighting in nearest neighbor classifier for gene expression data (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, pp. 372-381. , Springer; Angulo, A.P., Gene selection for microarray cancer data classification by a novel rule-based algorithm (2018) Information, 9 (1), pp. 1-15; Apolloni, J., Leguizamón, G., Alba, E., Two hybrid wrapper-filter feature selection algorithms applied to high-dimensional microarray experiments (2016) Applied Soft Computing, 38, pp. 922-932; Bolón-Canedo, V., Sánchez-Maroño, N., Alonso-Betanzos, A., An ensemble of filters and classifiers for microarray data classification (2012) Pattern Recognition, 45, pp. 531-539; Bolón-Canedo, V., Sánchez-Marono, N., Alonso-Betanzos, A., Benítez, J.M., Herrera, F., A review of microarray datasets and applied feature selection methods (2014) Information Sciences, 282, pp. 111-135; D'Agostino, M., Dardanoni, V., What's so special about Euclidean distance?

Most studies mention that a relational database cannot handle big data. This challenge has led to the presentation of the not only structured query language (NoSQL) database as a new concept of database technology. NoSQL supports large volumes of data by providing a mechanism for data storage, retrieval and more flexible than a relational database. One of the most powerful types of NoSQL database is the document-oriented database. Recently, many software developers are willing to migrate from using relational databases to NoSQL database because of scalability, availability, and performance. The document-oriented database has challenged as to how to obtain an appropriate schema for the document-oriented database. The existing approach to migrate a relational database to a document-oriented database does not consider all the properties of the former, especially on how to handle various types of relationships. This research proposed a flexible schema for a document-oriented database (SDOD). This study evaluated the development of agility based on the schema of a document-oriented database and query execution time. The evaluation verifies the reliability of the proposed schema.

The performance of processing structured data through a relational database has become incompatible with big data challenges. Nowadays, there is a need to deal with semi-structured data with a flexible schema for different applications. Not only SQL (NoSQL) has been presented to overcome the limitations of relational databases in terms of scale, performance, data model, and distribution system. Also, NoSQL supports semi-structured data and can handle a huge amount of data and provide flexibility in the data schema. But the data models of NoSQL systems are very complex, as there are no tools available to represent a scheme for NoSQL databases. In addition, there is no standard schema for data modelling of document-oriented databases. This study proposes a semi-structured data model for big data (SS-DMBD) that is compatible with a document-oriented database, and also proposes an algorithm for mapping the entity relationship (ER) model to SS-DMBD. A case study is used to evaluate the SS-DMBD and its features. The results show that this model can address most features of semi-structured data.

The proposed algorithm showed better performance in number of attempts and character comparisons compared to the original and recent and standard algorithms. E-Atheer algorithm used several types of databases, which are DNA, Protein, XML, Pitch, English, and Source. The best performancein the number of attempts is when the algorithm is executed using the pitch dataset. The worst performance is when it is used with DNA dataset.

It is possible to see application of large number of RFID readers to perform authentication process with RFID tag at the same time in RFID system. If there is an improper channel access algorithm implemented on RFID reader, it will cause readers-to-tag collision in RFID system. In order to resolve this issue, a proper timing of channel access on RFID tag should be estimated to avoid collision between RFID readers. In our proposed work, flowgraph model is recommended to be used as theoretical method for estimating over the air specific RFID protocol execution time required by different number of RFID readers and RFID tag in same zone. At the same time, we suggest that transmission channel access hold off time of each interfered RFID reader should take into consideration in order to avoid collision between RFID readers and tag. The transmission channel access hold off time of each interfered RFID reader is proportional with specific RFID protocol execution time for single authentication event involving a RFID reader and a RFID tag. With our proposed general function, it helps to provide reliability over the air specific RFID protocol execution time involving different number of RFID readers and tag in same zone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Flowgraph model; Radio frequency identification(RFID); Readers-to-tag collision; Specific RFID protocol execution time,Authentication; Collision avoidance; Graphic methods; Anti collision; Channel access; Channel access algorithms; General functions; RFID protocols; Tag collision; Theoretical methods; Transmission channels; Radio frequency identification (RFID),,,,,,,"Li, T., Chen, S., Ling, Y., Identifying the missing tags in a large rfid system (2010) Proc.

The traditional way to identify learning styles is through a questionnaire or survey. Despite being reliable these instruments have several shortcomings that hinder the learning style identification such as students are unmotivated to fill out a questionnaire and reluctant to provide information. Thus, to solve these problems, researchers have proposed several approaches to automatically detect learning styles. The automatic detection of learning styles is proven to be beneficial to students as it can supply them with learning materials according to their individual preferences. In this study we propose a hybrid approach that combines fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning method to classify students according to their learning styles and preferences. In the context of modeling the learning styles, a student model will be constructed based on the information of student's performance during the online course, personality and their gender. Within this study, we intend to outline our proposed model following the felder-silverman model of learning styles and the Big Five model of personality. © Medwell Journals, 2018.",Case-based reasoning; Classification; Fuzzy logic; Learning style; Personality; Students,,,,,,,,"Abrahamian, E., Weinberg, J., Grady, M., Stanton, C.M., The effect of personality-aware computer-human interfaces on learning (2004) J.

One of them is human senses and can be categorized by external parts and internal parts. For example external parts such as ears are used to sense audio, eyes are used to sense visual, and nose is used to sense smell. While for internal parts, emotion is used to sense feelings such as happiness and sadness. Although all of the senses that comes from the external and internal parts are important in human’s well-being, the Holy Quran has placed different emphasizes on all of these senses. This is because some of the senses are quoted more often than others. Using data extraction technology, this study finds that ears and eyes are quoted most often although ears seem to be more superior. Therefore, it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the reason why ears are quoted more often than eyes in the Holy Quran. In addressing this question, this paper applies two methods. Firstly, all verses related to sound and sight senses are gathered. Then the superiority between them are measured based on the book of exegesis (tafsir) and scientific reports. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Audio sense; Exegesis; Quranic philosophy; Science reports; Visual sense,,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: USIM/TRGS02_PROJEK)/ISI/59/50416

Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions such as in predicting movie preferences, social relationships, personality and music, and correlation between personality and job performance. Predicting personality from social media become the current trend as the information extracted can be utilized to improve the users' experiences with various computerized interfaces. Thus, many algorithms have been performed to predict personality from social media. In this paper, we compared the performance of several classifiers provided in WEKA namely Bayes, Functions, Rules, Trees, and Meta in predicting student's personality. Based on adopted framework, the profile data of undergraduate students were extracted from Twitter, analyzed, and then classified in the automatic personality prediction. Four features with significant correlation from the profile data have been selected to map into Big Five personality model. Only extraversion dimension of the Big Five was considered in this study. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the classifiers. Several parameters that were observed in the performance of the classifiers are classification accuracy, F-measure, time taken to build the model, Kappa statistic, and training errors. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that OneR algorithm is the best classifier in terms of the accuracy, F-measure, and Kappa statistic. © 2016 IEEE.",Big Five; Classification; Personality; Social media mining,Classification (of information); Control systems; Social networking (online); Students; 10-fold cross-validation; Big five; Classification accuracy; Experimental evaluation; Personality; Personality predictions; Social media minings; Undergraduate students; Forecasting,,,,,,,"Mairesse, F., Walker, M.A., Mehl, M.R., Moore, R.K., Using linguistic cues for the automation recognition of personality in conversation and text (2007) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30, pp. 457-500; Goldberg, L.R., The structure of phenotypic personality traits (1993) American Psychologist, 48, pp. 26-34; (2016) The Myers & Briggs Foundation, , http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbtipersonality-Type/mbti-basics/, MBTI® Basics.

Traditionally, self-assessment method via questionnaire is the most common means to identify personality. Since recommender systems and advertisement campaigns have evolved rapidly, personality computing has become a popular research field to provide personalisation to users. Currently, researchers have utilised social media data for automatically predicting personality. However, it is complex to mine the social media data as they are noisy, free-format, and of varying length and multimedia. This paper proposes a decision tree C4.5 algorithm to automatically predict personality based on Big Five model. The Big Five Inventory and ZeroR algorithm were included to be served as the baseline for performance evaluation. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that C4.5 performs better than ZeroR in terms of accuracy. © 2017 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.",Big Five; Decision tree; Personality; Social media,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, Z.I., (2015) Prediction Models of Extraversion and Neuroticism of Malaysian Facebook Users, , Masters Thesis, School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia; Alam, F., Stepanov, E.A., Riccardi, G., Personality Traits Recognition on Social Network – Facebook (2013) Computational Personality Recognition, pp. 6-9; Allport, G.W., Odbert, H.S., Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study (1936) Psychological Monographs, 47, pp. 1-178; Barrick, M.R., Mount, M.K., The Big Five Personality Dimensions and Job Performance: A Meta-Analysis (1991) Personnel Psychology, 44, pp. 1-26; Bishop-Clark, C., Wheeler, D.D., The Myers-Briggs Personality Type and Its Relationship to Computer Programming (1994) Journal of Research on Computing in Education, 26 (3), pp. 358-369; Cattell, R.B., The description of personality: Basic traits resolved into clusters (1943) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 38, pp. 476-506; Celli, F., Rossi, L., The Role of Emotional Stability in Twitter Conversation (2012) Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 10-17. , Avignon, France; Celli, F., Polonio, L., Relationships between Personality and Interactions in Facebook (2013) Social Networking: Recent Trends, Emerging Issues and Future Outlook, pp. 41-53; Chen, J., Haber, E., Kang, R., Hsieh, G., Mahmud, J., Making Use of Derived Personality: The Case of Social Media Ad Targeting (2015) Proceedings of the Ninth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, pp. 1-10; Fiske, D.W., Consistency of the factorial structures of personality ratings from different sources (1949) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 44, pp. 329-344; Golbeck, J., Norris, E., Personality, Movie Preferences, and Recommendations (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, Niagara, Ontario, Canada, pp. 1414-1415; Golbeck, J., Robles, C., Turner, K., Predicting personality with social media (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 Annual Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing System, pp. 253-262. , Vancouver, BC, Canada; Golbeck, J., Robles, C., Edmondson, M., Turner, K., Predicting Personality from Twitter (2011) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference of Privacy, Security, Risk, and Trust, and IEEE International Conference on Social Computing, pp. 149-156; Goldberg, L.R., Language and individual differences: The search for universals in personality lexicons (1981) Review of Personality and Social Psychology, 2, pp. 141-165. , L.

Several approaches have been proposed to help students with the process of learning programming. In this paper we proposed Mobile Agile Peer Assisted Learning (M-APAL), a mobile system designed to assist students in managing and completing programming assignments/tasks given by lecturer. Besides that, it also helps students in learning introductory programming C++ with their peers. M-APAL is designed using both peer learning concept and agile methodology approach i.e SCRUM. It is implemented on Android mobile application. The language used is HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, and JavaScript. The prototype of the application is successfully tested on first year students from the School of Computer Sciences and we found that the application helps the student to learn better with their peers using this platform. © 2016 IEEE.",Agile; Mobile; Peer Learning; SCRUM,Education; Information science; Students; Agile; Introductory programming; Learning programming; Mobile; Peer learning; Peer-assisted learning; Programming assignments; SCRUM; C++ (programming language),,,,,,,"Yacob, A., Saman, M.Y.Md., Assessing level of motivation of learning programming among engineering students (2012) Proc.

This study proposed a new hybrid string matching algorithm called AbdulRazzaq. This algorithm consisted of a combination between the new searching technique and selecting the good features from two original algorithms, namely, Smith and Karp–Rabin. The proposed algorithm showed lower number of attempts and character comparisons than those of the original algorithms and common algorithms in the string matching field. Abdul Razzaq algorithm used six types of databases, namely, DNA, Protein, XML, Pitch, English, and Source. The best database regarding the number of attempts of AbdulRazzaq algorithm was Pitch, whereas DNA was the worst. This algorithm can work with good performance in the number of character comparisons with all databases. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",AbdulRazzaq Algorithm; String Matching Algorithms; Type of Database,,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6313159",This research is partly supported by USM short term grant 304/PKOMP/6313159.,"Abdulrazzaq, A.A., Abdul Rashid, N., Hamdani, H.B.Y., Ghadban, R.M., Mahmood, A.W., Influenced Factors on Computation Among Quick Search, Two-Way and Karp-Rabin Algorithms (2009) Proceeding of the 3Rd International Conference on Informatics and Technology, 9, p. 100; Xu, D., Zhang, H., Fan, Y., The GPU-based High-performance Pattern-matching Algorithm for Intrusion Detection (2013) Journal of Computational Information System(Jcis), 9 (10), pp. 3791-3800; Bhukya, R., Somayajulu, D., Index Based Multiple Pattern Matching Algorithm Using DNA Sequence and Pattern Count (2011) International Journal of Information Technology and Knowledge Management(Ijca), 4 (2); Lu, C.W., (2008) String Matching Algorithms Based upon the Uniqueness Property and an Approximate String Matching Algorithm, , M.Sc.

Studies show that existing works handled only one or two programming languages. They are web-based platform, using marking scheme and strategy, are embedded in the learning management system and provides graphics user interface. This paper presents a proposed framework of an Automatic Assessment System for learning object oriented programming language. We initiate the research by first conducting survey, which investigates the needs of the system in the department. The survey was conducted on two main groups, which are the first year programming students and the lecturers who have experience in teaching programming. The results from the survey show that the Assessment system can help students in learning programming language as well as reduce the lecturers’ workload. We proposed a framework for Automatic Assessment system, which consists of five modules. The modules are teaching module to help students learn and submit program code; real time detector module to show existing error and supply hints to solve problem; marking module to compile, mark, execute, and pre-set evaluation criteria; analysis and reporting module to give instant feedback and social module for interactions between the users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Automatic assessment; Feedback; One-to-one tutor; Programming; Web application,Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Education; Feedback; Graphical user interfaces; Mathematical programming; Students; Surveys; Teaching; User interfaces; Automatic assessment; Evaluation criteria; First year programming; Learning management system; Learning programming; One-to-one tutor; Teaching programming; WEB application; Object oriented programming,,,,,,,"Blumenstein, M., Green, S., Nguyen, A., Muthukkumarasamy, V., GAME: A Generic automated marking environment for programming assessment (2004) Proceedings of International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing 2004, ITCC 2004, 1, 212p. , 216, 5–7 April; Douce, C., Livingstone, D., Orwell, J., Automatic test-based assessment of programming: A review (2005) J.

The existence of many Arabic language centers provides the help needed for this Muslims. However for fulltime working adults, these facilities did not cater for their unpredictable free time. This paper describes a framework for Collaborative Online Arabic Learning software towards understanding Quran (COAL-UQ). The objectives of COAL-UQ are to provide users an online tools for learning Arabic anytime and anywhere, to ease the non-Arabic speakers in understanding the messages and meanings of the Quran and to exploit existing learning tools for learning a new language. We implement the Think-Pair-Share method introduced by Lyman in 1981 in the collaborative software. The software also integrates other online learning tools and utilizes the tools to realize the Think-Pair-Share method. We provide video conferencing tools so users can have face-to-face interactions with human tutor.

In our proposed work, flowgraph model is recommended to use with saddlepoint approximation to estimate total time required by a RFID reader to complete its authentication task. In real world applications of RFID system, server is required to handle multiple RFID readers at the same time in order to have better coverage area of receiving data. Thus, each RFID reader accessed time to server should be limited to certain of time else it will cause network congestion on server. By knowing actual total time required by a single RFID reader to complete its authentication task with specific number of existence RFID tags, administrator can configure on server when it should terminate verification process and start new authentication event with other RFID readers. This will help server to automatically establish a new communication event with other RFID readers when there is no response from existing RFID reader after certain of time. The data analysis model which we have used to represent each task of authentication process in RFID system is known as semi-Markov model. Based on the flowgraph models presented on our paper, information such as moment generating function for each authentication process in RFID system and probability of transition to next authentication task in RFID system are available. © 2013 The Franklin Institute.

GN-DTD allows us to capture syntax and semantic of XML documents in a simple way but precise. Using various notations, the important features of XML documents such as elements, attributes, relationship, hierarchical structure, cardinality, sequence and disjunction between elements or attribute are visualize clearly at the schema level. We believe, by having GN-DTD as tool, helps the user to arrange the content of XML documents in order to give a better undertanding of DTD structures, to improve XML design and normalization process. In this paper we presented also the transformation rules to convert from GN-DTD to DTD. © 2010 IEEE.",XML design; XML model; XML schema,Cardinalities; Data type; Graphical approach; Graphical notation; Hierarchical structures; Normalization process; Transformation rules; XML schema; XML schemas; Markup languages; Structural design; XML,,,,,,,"Arenas, M., Libkin, L., A normal form for XML documents (2004) ACM Transaction on Database System, 29 (1), pp. 195-232; Bex, G.J., Neven, F., Bussche, J.V., DTD versus XML Schema.

More importantly, this will avoid data redundancies and update anomalies when maintaining a large quantity of XML based documents. In this paper, we propose a method to improve XML structural design by adopting graphical notations for Document Type Definitions (GN-DTD), which is used to describe the structure of an XML document at the schema level. Multiples levels of normal forms for GN-DTD are proposed on the basis of conceptual model approaches and theories of normalization.

Our main research is to develop a tool which can be used to access and manipulate protein information from difference databases. In our approach, we have integrated difference databases such as Swiss-prot, PDB, Interpro, and EMBL and transformed these databases in flat file format into relational form using XML and Bioperl. As a result, we showed this tool can search different sizes of protein information stored in relational database and the result can be retrieved faster compared to flat file database.
