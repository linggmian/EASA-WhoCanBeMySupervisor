Knowledge workers face a high mental workload in terms of planning and coordination. One solution is to predict the mental workload of knowledge workers. Some machine learning models have been implemented for mental workload prediction, but deep learning models are yet to be introduced for this purpose. Deep learning models are superior to machine learning models because of their ability to correct inaccurate predictions if they ever occur. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) by integrating particle swarm optimization into a micro-genetic algorithm to predict the mental workload of knowledge workers. Although the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) shows reasonable prediction performance, it also suffers from the curse of dimensionality and has a poor computation time. Thus, ELANFIS is introduced because its curse of dimensionality is less severe when solving problems with a high number of input dimensions. The integration of the advantages of a micro-genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization is suggested to optimize the premise parameters of ELANFIS, as this can allow better solutions to be located at a faster rate. The proposed model yields promising prediction results, with improvements of 6.0665 in the Mean Squared Error(MSE) and 1.279 in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regression; the proposed model even surpasses the prediction results of ELANFIS optimized with PSO alone, with improvements of 1.5369 in MSE and 0.4094 in RMSE for regression. The findings are expected to assist employers in determining an appropriate working lifestyle for their employees. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Behavior Recognition; Deep Learning; Genetic Algorithms; NeurofuzzyNetworks; Optimization; Particle Swarm Algorithms; Regression,Deep learning; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Human resource management; Inference engines; Knowledge management; Mean square error; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Curse of dimensionality; Knowledge workers; Machine learning models; Mean squared error; Micro genetic algorithm; Prediction performance; Root mean squared errors; Learning systems,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6315435","The authors are thankful to School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia for unlimited supports to publish this paper.

IoT-based technologies transform medical decision-making by offering various services such as transmitting medial data/biomedical signals, patient tracking and remote monitoring, reliable access to medical data, and quick emergency services. Although, there are many benefits in merging new IoT technologies with telemedicine, the role of IoT in medical and technical decision-making is not clear enough for medical professionals. Therefore, this chapter aims to perform a systematic review of the relevant literature to elucidate various IoT applications for enhanced medical and technical decision-making. Electronic database search is performed to obtain the studies from 2017 to 2021 using search strategies. IEEE Xplore and PubMed are included for database search. Around 272 papers were selected from searching strategies. While reviewing the title of those papers, filtration was applied, and some papers were removed. Among all papers, only 73 journal articles which only focus on the role of IoT for medical decision-making were included in this study. ATLAS.ti was used for coding, qualitative analysis and visualization of the included papers to extract the relevant information to this study. IoT-based techniques were highlighted and their role in the enhancement of medical and technical decision were discussed. This chapter can be useful for healthcare providers for using relevant IoT-based solutions for providing better decision-making for medical information systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Internet of things; Medical decision-making; Medical information systems; Qualitative analysis; Systematic review,,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6315435","Acknowledgements The author is thankful to School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for unlimited supports.

In order for an individual to protect their health, they are required to adopt healthy eating and practice regular exercises which also means that they have to adapt to a habit change in their daily routine. This healthy habit change does not only protect against heart diseases but also other chronic diseases such as cancer and stroke. Therefore, a habit-change support web-based system with big data analytics and decision-making features called Doctive is developed in this study to lower the risks of heart diseases. Doctive is targeted for hospital authorities to monitor patients and their habits and to prescribe medication and advice based on patients’ habits and gathered information. Furthermore, this system also provides emergency assistance for patients based on their current location. This proposed system, would also be beneficial in collecting and organizing patients’ information to ease access and speed the process of data entry and retrieval. The system was tested and evaluated by 5 people who were medically qualified or with knowledge and expertise in the field of data analytics and visualization. After gathering their opinionated responses, the results were tabulated and analyzed to be taken into consideration for improvements and to garner ideas for the future development of the system. Doctive can be useful for healthcare providers and developers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Big data analytics; Decision-making; Habit-change; Medical information system; Web-based system,Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Big data; Cardiology; Data Analytics; Data visualization; Decision making; Diseases; Hospitals; Patient monitoring; Websites; Chronic disease; Daily routines; Health care providers; Heart disease; Hospital authorities; Medical services; Mortality rate; Web-based system; Search engines,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6315435","Acknowledgment.

The risk factors of this deadly disease are due to some bad habits such as being overweight, bad eating diet, smoking, assumption of alcohol, etc. Nevertheless, patients can live a healthy lifestyle if they have the proper guidance of persuasive-emotional featured technologies. In line with this, this study focuses on developing an emotional-persuasive habit-change support mobile application called BeHabit to improve heart disease patients’ lifestyles. Persuasive-emotional features are two different features that are integrated with BeHabit to distinguish this application from the existing ones.

This empirical study aims to assess the interaction between human and iHeart. In line with this, a survey was conducted among healthcare professional in two cities of Isfahan and Penang to find how intention to “Use” of iHeart and “User satisfaction” conveys the role of effective factors [Information Quality (IQ), Service Quality (SQ), System Quality (SysQ), Trust (Tr), Anxiety (Ax), and mHealth Literacy (mHL)] to the “Success of Human Interaction (SHI)” with iHeart. The total number of 323 respondents returned the questionnaire. Using DeLone and McLean IS success model, a conceptual model was developed to identify the mediating effects of “Use” and “User satisfaction”. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied for data analysis using the statistical software AMOS. In this study, mediation effect was examined in three different methods including Baron and Kenny, Sobel test, and Bootstrapping technique. The most reliable results are from bootstrapping technique, which indicate that “Use” mediates the effects of SysQ, Tr, and mHL on SHI. In addition, “User satisfaction” is a mediator between SysQ, SQ, and mHL with SHI. Ultimately, IQ has direct effect on SHI without involvement of mediator. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Assessment; Human–computer interaction; Medical information system; mHealth; Success; Use; User satisfaction,Bioinformatics; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Information use; mHealth; Statistical methods; Surveys; Assessment; Computer interaction; Health care professionals; Information quality; Statistical software; Structural equation modelling; Success; User satisfaction; Medical information systems,,,,,"Nav6

At the same time, it plays a great role in several other domains due to the fact that anomaly may reveal rare but represent an important phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to detect anomalies and identify the possible variables that caused these anomalies on historical assembly data for two series of products. Multiple anomaly detection techniques were performed; HBOS, IForest, KNN, CBLOF, OCSVM, LOF, and ABOD. Moreover, we used AUROC and Rank Power as performance metrics, followed by Boosting ensemble learning method to ensure the best anomaly detectors robustness. The techniques that gave the highest performance are KNN, ABOD for both product series datasets with 0.95 and 0.99 AUROC respectively. Finally, we applied a statistical root cause analysis on the detected anomalies with the use of Pareto chart to visualize the frequency of the possible causes and its cumulative occurrence. The results showed that there are seven rejection causes for both product series, whereas the first three causes are responsible for 85% of the rejection rates. Besides, assembly machines engineers reported a significant reduction in the rejection rates in both assembly machines after tuning the specification limits of the rejection causes identified by this research results. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Though early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment of the disease, immediate reaction in cases of emergency is crucial significance in saving the lives of stricken. Previous studies on patient-centric healthcare indicate that both the patient's whereabouts and the locality of the healthcare centers play a vital role at moment of crisis. Not only it is important for a patient to be able to find the nearest healthcare points, it is also necessary for the emergency centers to know the exact location of the patient seeking for help. To this end, a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (iHeart) is proposed, which is a patient-centric healthcare system, to monitor and track the patient via a wearable device and their mobile phones. Therefore, this study aims to find healthcare professional's opinion and to find success factors of such a system before its full implementation. A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire in Malaysia and Iran. In order to conduct the survey, a conceptual model was proposed based on DeLone and McLean Information Success Model. A total number of 323 data was collected from both countries. The results were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software. Multi-group comparison was applied to find differences in points of view from both countries. The results of this study revealed the success factors of iHeart before the full implementation. It was found that nationality plays a moderating role between some of the success factors and success of iHeart. The success of a patient-centric healthcare system is bound to the culture of a particular nation as well as to the technological advancements, facilities, and the needs of the target users, meaning that in order for a novel healthcare system to be publicly acknowledged and utilized; target users must be classified and assessed accordingly. The findings of the present study are highly beneficial to both patients suffering from Coronary Heart Disease and the healthcare providers that seek to utilize new patient-centric healthcare systems, devices, and electronic applications to rescue patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Emergency; Location-based; Mobile healthcare; Multi-group comparison; Nationality; Patient-centric; Success model,Cardiology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Heart; Location; mHealth; Surveys; Emergency; Location based; Multi-group; Nationality; Patient-centric; Success models; Cellular telephone systems,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,"The research is done at the expense of the prestigious USM Fellowship Scheme granted in 2013 to Pantea Keikhosrokiani to pursue her Doctoral studies in Service System Engineering at School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.

A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire to Smartphone users in Penang, Malaysia for the duration of three weeks starting in September 2013. A total number of 123 valid surveys out of 150 were returned, which is equivalent to a response rate of 82%. The authors use Partial Least Squares (PLS) for analyzing the proposed measurement model. The factors that are tested are self-efficacy, anxiety, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, attitude, and behavioral intention to use. The results indicate which factors have a significant effect on Smartphone users’ behavioral intention and which factors are not significant. The results assist in assessing whether MHS is highly demanded by users or not, and will assist in development of the system in the future. © 2019 by IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned Behavior (1985) Action Control, pp. 11-39. , J.

One of the widely used assistive technologies is the tactile map that consists of Braille labeling and features annotation. The tactile map enables the visually impaired to understand the geographical information of a particular place. However, despite its wide usage, tactile map still lacks in its usability and availability especially in Malaysia. This paper aims to investigate the usability issues of tactile map, identify the requirements and proposed a conceptual prototype named TacTalk to overcome the usability issues of the existing tactile map. Interviews were conducted with the visually impaired at Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind in Penang. The results shows lack of information, misinterpretation, complexity, and hard to remember the map as the four main usability issues. Hence the proposed solution is named TacTalk, a 'talking tactile map' which consist of a tactile map with embedded buttons that will connect to TacTalk mobile application via Bluetooth to play the audio files once the button is pressed by the user. © 2017 IEEE.",assistive technology; navigation; Tactile map; visually impaired,Navigation; Usability engineering; Vision aids; Assistive technology; Audio files; Geographical information; Malaysia; Mobile applications; Tactile maps; Visually impaired; Maps,,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6313219

In the literature, low health literacy and negative health attitude are the two main causal factors for high number of lifestyle disease. Meanwhile, mobile health or better known as mHealth is found to enhance health literacy and encourage positive health attitude. This study aims to find the relationship between health literacy, health attitude and lifestyle disease for residence in Malaysia. A total of 150 responses have been collected using a questionnaire posted via social media platforms. The findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between health literacy and lifestyle disease as well as health attitude and lifestyle disease.

In this paper, a simulation on watering hole attack and spear phishing; comparison between these two APT variants, as well as the survey design based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) are presented. The result of the survey is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The result demonstrated that severity factor and vulnerability factor moderately explained the Protection Behaviour factor; and Protection Behaviour factor is a moderately strong predictor to self-efficacy, but avoidance behavior does not predict self-efficacy directly. Based on this result, a set of security policy for hindering watering hole and spear phishing attack is designed and implemented.

As the population increases, the necessity for healthcare services also increase which includes healthcare for heart patients. Heart diseases have become one of the leading causes of death. We have to take the correct precaution beforehand in order to avoid problems later on in future. Nowadays, many people are not willing to seek for medical help until their heart related conditions has worsened. Thus, Mobile Healthcare Locator System for Heart Patients (MMHLSHP) is proposed with the intention to save the patients in critical situations as w ell as m improve healthcare services for heart patients during emergency. The objective of MHLSHP is mainly tr track and show the patient's current location and to locate the nearest healthcare point, and assist in reaching to the nearest Emergency Center (EC) to seek for medical help. The location coordinates of the healthcare points can be retrieved by Global Positioning System (GPS). Using location-based services (LBS), it will provide us the exact locations of the nearest healthcare center. This paper provider the system design and architecture for MHLSHIP together with system and unit tests of the proposed system. The results indicate that MHLSHP is indeed a beneficial emergency locator system, which will enable the critical heart patients or their caregiver to locate the nearest healthcare points and inform the nearest emergency centers. The notification on emergencies will be relayed to the EC, in order for them to take immediate actions, for example, sending an ambulance to the patient's current location. The design of the proposed system can provide useful prospect for healthcare providers to enhance and develop such kind of healthcare system for heart patients. © 2016 IEEE.",Global positioning system; Heart disease; Location-based services; Smartphone; Wireless technology,Cardiology; Diseases; Global positioning system; Health care; Heart; Information science; Location; Telecommunication services; Tracking (position); Wireless telecommunication systems; Causes of death; Health care providers; Health-care system; Healthcare services; Heart disease; Heart patients; Mobile health care; Wireless technologies; Location based services,,,,,,,,"Ho, F., Healthy hearts (2013) The Star Online, , http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Health/2013/09/29/Healthy-hearts, Sept. 29, Accessed: Oct. 10, 2014; Shahar, F.M., UiTM: Malaysians at high risk of heart disease (2014) New Straits Times Online, , http://www.nst.com.my/node/39273, Oct. 2, Accessed: Oct. 10, 2014; Kappiarukudil, K.J., Ramesh, M.V., (2010) Real-time Monitoring and Detection of ""Heart Attack"" Using Wireless Sensor Networks, pp. 632-636; Fong, E.M., Chung, W.Y., (2013) Mobile Cloud-computing-based Healthcare Service by Noncontact ECG Monitoring, pp. 16451-16473. , Sensor, Dec; Keikhosrokiani, P., (2012) A Proposal to Measure Success Factors for Location-based Mobile Cardiac Telemedicine System (LMCTS), pp. 57-66; Subudhi, S.K., Sivanandam, S., (2014) Intelligent Wireless Monitoring and Tracking System, pp. 97-104; Sundaram, P., (2013) Patient Monitoring System Using Android Technology, pp. 191-201; Hande, A., Polk, T., (2006) Self-powered Wireless Sensor Networks for Remote Patient Monitoring in Hospitals, pp. 1102-1117; Trappey, C.V., (2009) Develop Patient Monitoring and Support System Using Mobile Communication and Intelligent Reasoning, pp. 1226-1231; Mercer, E., (2009) Bluetooth Technology in Health Care; (2016) Understanding Blood Pressure Readings, , http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Understanding-Blood-Pressure-Readings_UCM_301764_Article.jsp#.V0lbQjV97cs, Accessed: 29-May-2016; Keikhosrokiani, P., (2013) E-torch: A Mobile Commerce Location-based Promotion System, pp. 140-159; Mathew, G., (2013) Showing Nearby Places and Place Details Using Google Places API and Google Maps Android API V2; Danalet, A., A Bayesian approach to detect pedestrian destination-sequences from wifi signatures (2014) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; Hønsi, T., (2015) Highcharts - Create Interactive Charts Easily for Your Web Projects",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"3rd International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences, ICCOINS 2016",15 August 2016 through 17 August 2016,,125433,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Int.

A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire to Smartphone users in Penang, Malaysia for the duration of three weeks starting in September 2013. A total number of 123 valid surveys out of 150 were returned, which is equivalent to a response rate of 82%. The authors use Partial Least Squares (PLS) for analyzing the proposed measurement model. The factors that are tested are self-efficacy, anxiety, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, attitude, and behavioral intention to use. The results indicate which factors have a significant effect on Smartphone users' behavioral intention and which factors are not significant. The results assist in assessing whether MHS is highly demanded by users or not, and will assist in development of the system in the future. © 2015 by IGI Global.

With affordable cost and vast coverage, millions of users can access location co-ordinates from any part of the world due to wireless positioning techniques. In this study, we highlight different positioning methods, location-based services and vast variety of applications benefited from these methods and services. This paper covers brief mathematical models used among all the wireless positioning systems along with their comparison. In today's fast pace information era, location-based services are not only used for hotspot navigation but, also used for marketing strategy and so on. In addition, this article includes location-based services that access mobile network, and utilized the current location of the mobile device appropriately. Finally we classify the location-based solutions that have been used in variety of models such health services, marketing, tourism, entertainment and advertisement, and so forth. The study concludes that with evolution of technological advancement, wireless positioning system will be more improved and will be used in every part of our daily life in an effective manner. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht(Outside the USA).",Cellular network; Global positioning system (GPS); Location positioning methods; Location-based services; Wireless technologies,Cellular network; Positioning methods; Satellite positioning systems; Technological advancement; Wireless communication network; Wireless positioning; Wireless positioning systems; Wireless technologies; Commerce; Global positioning system; Location based services; Marketing; Mathematical models; Mobile devices; Wireless telecommunication systems; Tracking (position),,,,,,,,"Khalel, A.M.H., Position location techniques in wireless communication systems (2010) Master Electrical Engineering Emphasis on Telecommunications, , Blekinge Institute of Technology Karlskrona, Sweden; Schiller, J., Voisard, A., (2004) Location-based Services, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers-Elsevier, San Francisco; Virrantaus, K., Developing GIS-supported location-based services (2001) Web Information Systems Engineering, pp. 66-75; Espinoza, F., Persson, P., Sandin, A., Nystrom, H., Cacciatore, E., Bylund, M., GeoNotes: Social and navigational aspects of location-based information systems (2001) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, (2201), pp. 2-17. , Ubicomp 2001: Ubiquitous Computing; Willaredt, J., WiFi and cell-ID based positioning-protocols, standards and solutions (2010) 2nd International Conference on Computer and Network Technology, , Presented at the; Rappaport, T.S., Reed, J.H., Woerner, B.D., Position location using wireless communications on highways of the future (1996) IEEE Communications Magazine, 34 (10), pp. 33-41; Kayton, M., Fried, W.R., (1997) Avionics Navigation Systems, , 2nd edn.

Location-based services can be used in mobile cardiac telemedicine systems to improve efficiency, robustness and accuracy. This paper proposes a combination of mobile telemedicine systems and location-based services that will enable hospitals and emergency departments to do continuous monitoring of a patient's heart activity; such a system would decrease the probability of critical condition patients in emergency cases and increase the chance of saving lives. In order to evaluate whether this kind of health care system might work, we explore the success factors for such a system by adapting the DeLone & McLean IS success model to the context of location-based mobile system in cardiac healthcare. After reviewing previous works, we identify fourteen factors which can affect the success of a location-based mobile cardiac telemedicine system: Realization of user expectations, Portability, Accessibility, Extent of data processing, Time response, Urgency, Currency, Sufficiency, Understandability, Reliability, Extent of Mobility (spatial, temporal, contextual), System support, Responsiveness, and Assurance. We apply these factors to propose a success model for our location-based mobile cardiac telemedicine system.",Cardiac telemedicine system; DeLone & McLean IS success model; IS success; Location-based services; Mobile communication,Continuous monitoring; Critical condition; Emergency departments; Health-care system; IS success; IS success model; Location based; Medical emergency; Mobile communications; Mobile systems; Mobile telemedicine system; Patient's heart; Success factors; Success models; System supports; Telemedicine systems; Time response; Understandability; User expectations; Blood pressure; Data processing; Health care; Hospitals; Location based services; Telemedicine; Heart,,,,,,,,"Lin, C.-F., Mobile Telemedicine: A Survey Study (2010) Journal of Medical Systems, pp. 1-10; Kizhakkepurayil, S., Jeon-Yeoul, O., Lee, Y., Sobh, T., Mobile Application for Healthcare System - Location Based Innovations and Advances in Computer Sciences and Engineering, pp. 297-302. , Springer Netherlands; Fahim Sufi, Q.F., Khalil, I., Mahmoud, S.S., Novel methods of faster cardiovascular diagnosis in wireless telecardiology (2009) Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 27, pp. 537-552; (1996) Telemedicine: A Guide to Assessing Telecommunications for Health Care, , C. o.

In this paper a new parking system called Smart Parking System (SPS) is proposed to assist drivers to find vacant spaces in a car park in a shorter time. The new system uses ultrasonic (ultrasound) sensors to detect either car park occupancy or improper parking actions. Different detection technologies are reviewed and compared to determine the best technology for developing SPS. Features of SPS include vacant parking space detection, detection of improper parking, display of available parking spaces, and directional indicators toward vacant parking spaces, payment facilities and different types of parking spaces (vacant, occupied, reserved and handicapped) through the use of specific LEDs. This paper also describes the use of an SPS system from the entrance into a parking lot until the finding of a vacant parking space. The system is designed for a four-level parking lot with 100 parking spaces and five aisles on each floor. The system architecture defines the essential design features such as location of sensors, required number of sensors and LEDs for each level, and indoor and outdoor display boards.",Car park; Improper parking Directional signage; SPS; Ultrasonic sensors,,,,,,,,,"Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behaviour: An Introduction to Theory and Research; Coopers, P.W.H., (2005) From Beijing to Budapest-Winning Brands.

Multicast has the potential to optimize network performance and support scalable distributed applications without compromising performance, efficiency, and QoS but introduces new challenges to transmit multicast packet in the backbone especially when incorporated into wireless mesh network with limited bandwidth. We propose ROHC enabled tunnel for source specific multicast architecture that will compress packet header and aggregate them to together in a frame to save bandwidth and address the packet loss. Our ROHC enabled tunneling protocol will act as SSM channel (S, G) and is designed to be deployed in the backbone network. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the how to address the bandwidth efficiency and packet loss with respect to our proposed tunneling protocol. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",IPv6; ROHC; Source-specific multicast; Tunneling protocol; VOIP,IPv6; ROHC; Source specific multicast; Tunneling protocol; VOIP; Bandwidth; Engineering technology; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Materials science; MESH networking; Multicasting; Network performance; Packet loss; Video streaming; Voice/data communication systems; Network architecture,,,,,,,,"Piri, E., Pinola, J., Fitzek, F., Pentikousis, K., ROHC and aggregated VoIP over fixed WiMAX: An empirical evaluation (2008) Proc.

The Wearable Health Monitoring System (WHMS) is used to manage and monitor chronic disease in elderly people, postoperative rehabilitation patients and persons with special needs. Location-aware healthcare is achievable as positioning systems and telecommunications have been developed and have fulfilled the technology needed for this kind of healthcare system. In this paper, the researchers propose a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (LMCES) to track the patient's current location when Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has been activated as well as to locate the nearest healthcare unit for the ambulance service. The location coordinates of the patients can be retrieved by GPS and sent to the healthcare centre using GPRS. The location of the patient, cell ID information will also be transmitted to the LMCES server in order to retrieve the nearest health care unit. For the LMCES, we use Dijkstra's algorithm for selecting the shortest path between the nearest healthcare unit and the patient location in order to facilitate the ambulance's path under critical conditions. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.",Cardiac emergency services; Dijkstra's algorithm; Global positioning system; Location-based services; Mobile healthcare; Remote patient monitoring; Telemedicine,Ambulances; Emergency services; Global positioning system; Health care; Location; Medical computing; mHealth; Patient rehabilitation; Remote patient monitoring; Telemedicine; Ambulance services; Critical condition; Dijkstra's algorithms; Emergency medical services; Health-care system; Positioning system; Postoperative rehabilitations; Wearable health-monitoring systems; Location based services,,,,,,,,"Ren-Guey, L., Kuei-Chien, C., Chun-Chieh, H., Chwan-Lu, T., A mobile care system with alert mechanism (2007) Information Technology in Biomedicine, IEEE Transactions on, 11, pp. 507-517; Pattichis, C.S., Kyriacou, E., Voskarides, S., Pattichis, M.S., Istepanian, R., Schizas, C.N., Wireless telemedicine systems: An overview (2002) Antennas and Propagation Magazine, IEEE, 44, pp. 143-153; Lin, C.-F., Mobile telemedicine: A survey study (2010) Journal of Medical Systems, pp. 1-10; Espinoza, F., Persson, P., Sandin, A., Nyström, H., Cacciatore, E., Bylund, M., (2001) GeoNotes: Social and Navigational Aspects of Location-Based Information Systems; Kizhakkepurayil, S., Jeon-Yeoul, O., Lee, Y., Sobh, T., (2010) Mobile Application for Healthcare System - Location Based Innovations and Advances in Computer Sciences and Engineering, pp. 297-302. , Springer Netherlands; Lin, C.-F., Lee, H.-W., Wireless multimedia communication toward mobile telemedicine (2009) Proceedings of the 9th WSEAS International Conference on Applied Informatics and Communications, pp. 232-237. , Moscow, Russia: World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society (WSEAS); Pattichis, C.S., Kyriacou, E., Voskarides, S., Pattichis, M.S., Istepanian, R., Schizas, C.N., Wireless telemedicine systems: An overview (2002) Antennas and Propagation Magazine, IEEE, 44, pp. 143-153; Pantelopoulos, A., Bourbakis, N.G., A survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis (2010) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on, 40, pp. 1-12; Fahim Sufi, Q.F., Khalil, I., Mahmoud, S.S., Novel methods of faster cardiovascular diagnosis in wireless telecardiology (2009) Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 27, pp. 537-552; Maglogiannis, I., Hadjiefthymiades, S., EmerLoc: Location-based services for emergency medical incidents (2007) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 76, pp. 747-759; Chew, S.H., Chong, P.A., Gunawan, E., Goh, K.W., Kim, Y., Soh, C.B., A hybrid mobile-based patient location tracking system for personal healthcare applications (2006) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2006.

SPS detects occupancy of each car park and concurrently display the number of vacant spaces and directional signage to the available car parks on the display boards. In order to assess user acceptance level toward using SPS, a research model is proposed by combining three different research theories which are Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). An online survey with 150 respondents has been conducted to evaluate the user acceptance level based on perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), subjective norm (SN) and performance expectancy (PE) variables. The result of the survey verified that SPS is going to be successful project because of the high proportion of respondents accept SPS due to its ease of use and usefulness for them. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Car park; Directional signage; Multilevel parking lot; Perceived Ease of Use; Perceived Usefulness; Performance Expectancy; Subjective Norm,Car parks; Directional signage; Multilevel parking lot; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Performance Expectancy; Subjective norm; Garages (parking); Information science; Parking; Parks; Surveys; Behavioral research,,,,,,,,"Coopers, P.W.H., From Beijing to Budapest - Wining Brands (2005) Winning Formats, 126; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behaviour: An Introduction to Theory and Research; Huang, C.C., Wang, S.J., A Hierarchical Bayesian Generation Framework for Vacant Parking Space Detection (2010) IEEE Transactions Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, p. 99; Masrom, M., Hussein, R., (2008) User Acceptance of Information Technology: Understanding Theories and Models, , Venton publishing (M) Sdn.
