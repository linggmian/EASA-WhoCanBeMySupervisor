With the increasing number of DR cases, diabetic eye screening is a challenging task for experts. Adopting machine learning to create a high accuracy classifier will be able to reduce the burden of diabetic eye screening. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a high accuracy DR classifier using clinical attributes. This study was conducted using nine clinical attributes of 385 diabetic patients, who were already labelled regarding DR, where 79 patients did not suffer from DR (NODR), 161 patients had nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 145 patients had proliferative DR (PDR). The data was then used to develop a DR classifier through the hybrid of optimised Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiment results showed that the hybrid classifier had a high accuracy of 94.55. The accuracy yield was higher compared to single classifier. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification; Diabetic Retinopathy; Hybridisation; Neural Network; Support Vector Machine","Diagnosis; Eye protection; Support vector machines; Diabetic patient; Diabetic retinopathy; High-accuracy; Hybrid classifier; Hybridisation; Neural networks",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 203/PKOMP/6711802","Acknowledgement.

Two main colour transformation algorithms namely the Daltonize and RGB-HSV algorithm are compared to see the differences. The RGB-HSV algorithm was then selected to improve the colour contrast of the transformed images. The proposed algorithm from RGB colour space to HSV colour space focuses on the brightness of red and blue colours where red is modified to light red while green is modified to dark blue.

The objective of this strategy is to produce optimum maintenance times for system components. The island model is used to divide the total population into smaller sub populations, where for each island, a harmony search is used to find the optimal maintenance cost. To test the system, a data set for maintenance based on replacement policy was used. The test results from the data set were compared to those obtained from a general gradient with branch and bound (GRG with BB), simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA). From the results, it concludes that the island-HS had improved the cost compared to GA and SA and was close to the exact optimal value obtained from GRG with BB algorithm. © 2015, ICIC International.","Harmony search; Island model; Maintenance cost optimization","Algorithms; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Simulated annealing; Statistical tests; Harmony search; Harmony search algorithms; Island model; Maintenance cost optimization; Optimal maintenance; Optimization strategy; Replacement policy; System components; Maintenance",,,,,,,"Gertsbakh, I., (2005) Handbook of Reliability Engineering, , Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin; Sortrakul, N., Nachtmann, H.L., Cassady, C.R., Genetic algorithms for integrated preventive maintenance planning and production scheduling for a single machine (2005) Computers in Industry, 56 (2), pp. 161-168; Mirabedini, N., Iranmanesh, H., A scheduling model for serial jobs on parallel machines with different preventive maintenance (pm) (2014) Int.

Red-green colour deficiency is the most common category of color blindness which causes red and green to be seen as beige color. From the comparison, the RGB color space to HSV conversion technique is chosen to be modified, which only allows red and green to be specifically transformed into yellow and blue. The images are extracted from websites and passed through the colour transformation algorithm for image processing. The modified colour transformation algorithm is implemented to websites to make the websites more accessible to the colour blind to help them improving their color visibility when browsing through the websites. The outcome of the transformation leads to enhancement of website images to meet the color blinds' vision requirements in perceiving image detailed. The colour transformation algorithm is then tested on a group of 35 people who have colour vision deficiency via a designed questionnaire handed out to them.

The most common category of color blindness is red-green color blindness which is viewed as beige color. By transforming the colors of the images, the color blind can improve their color visibility. They can have a better view when browsing through the websites. To transform colors on the website images, we study on two algorithms which are the conversion techniques from RGB color space to HSV color space and self-organizing color transformation. The comparative study focuses on criteria based on the ease of use, quality, accuracy and efficiency. The outcome of the study leads to enhancement of website images to meet the color blinds' vision requirements in perceiving image detailed.","Color blind; Color transformation; HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value); RGB (Red, Green, Blue)","Color blinds; Color transformation; Comparative studies; Ease of use; Green color; HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value); HSV color spaces; RGB (Red, Green, Blue); RGB color space; Self organizing; Ease-of-use; Color vision; Eye protection; Image enhancement; Websites; Color",,,,,,,"Kim, Y.K., Kim, K.W., Yang, X., Real Time Traffic LightRecognition System for Color Vision Deficiencies (2007) Proceedings ofIEEE Xplore, pp. 76-81; Lai, C.L., Chang, S.W., An image Processing Based VisualCompensation System for Vision Defects (2008) International Symposium onIEEE Xplore, pp. 472-476; Ma, Y., Gu, X., Wang, Y., Color Discrimination Enhancement forDichromats Using Self-organizing Color Transformation (2009) Information Science, 179, pp. 830-843; Ohkubo, T., Kobayashi, K., A Color Compensation Vision Systemfor Color-blind people (2008) SICE Annual Conference, pp. 1286-1289; Yang, S., Ro, Y.M., Visual Contents Adaptation for Color VisionDeficiency (2003) ICIP Proceedings, 1, pp. 1-453","Ching, S.-L.; School of Computer Science, , 11800 Minden, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia; email: sherylching86@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,2010376X,,,,"English","World Acad.

Compared to other interest groups, technical SIG groups require more beneficial communications and materials to be shared among the members. However, they may encounter a lot of challenges to draw the interest among the members in sharing their knowledge voluntarily. A lot of knowledge sharing researches focuses on how to develop a knowledge sharing system. Hence, they overlook the need to integrate social aspects in the design of such systems. As the result, the systems face inactive participants among the members. In fact, the most crucial part of developing such online communities is on how to encourage users to contribute and share their knowledge. We must discover the underlying problems on why the users are reluctant to share their knowledge through the knowledge sharing system. This paper discusses the survey conducted in order to gain users' perspectives towards such systems for SIG. © 2009 IEEE.","Knowledge sharing; Motivation; Obstacles; Special interest group (SIG); Survey","E-community; Knowledge sharing; Knowledge sharing systems; Obstacles; Online communities; Special interest groups; Motivation; Social aspects; Surveys; User interfaces; Knowledge based systems",,,,,,,"Niwa, K., Towards successful implementation of knowledge-based systems: Expert systems vs. Knowledge sharing systems (1990) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 37 (4). , November 1990; Durrani, T.S., (2004) IEEE Engineering Management Review, 32 (3), p. 3. , Special Interest Groups for the IEEE Engineering Management Society; (2009) MySEIG, , http://www.myseig.org; Hall, H., Goody, M., KM, culture and compromise: Interventions to promote knowledge sharing supported by technology in corporate environments (2007) Journal of Information Science Archive, 33 (2), pp. 181-188. , Sage Publications, April 2007; Hall, H., Input-friendliness: Motivating knowledge sharing across intranets (2001) Journal of Information Science, 27, pp. 139-146. , Jun; Ong, C.-S., Lai, J.-Y., Wang, Y.-M., Wang, S.-W., An understanding of power issues influencing employees' acceptance of KMS: An empirical study of Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companies (2005) Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference (HICSS'05), pp. 269a-269a. , January; Huang, C.-C., Yen, C.-H., Chiu, J., Hwang, W.-J., Hsu, M.-H., Establishing knowledge sharing in virtual community through trust, self-efficacy and is success model (2005) PACIS, 2005, Proceedings Paper, 9. , http://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2005/9; Gillies, J.S., Cultural obstacles to a successful KM initiative in large law firms (2005) KMWorld & Intranets 2005 Conferences & Exposition, , San Jose, November; Skyrme, D.J., The 3Cs of knowledge sharing: Culture, coopetition and commitment (2002) I3 Update/Entovation International News, , http://www.skyrme.com/updates/u64_f1.htm, August; Chen, A.L.P., Wu, Y.-H., Chen, Y.-C., Enabling personalized recommendation on the web based on user interest and behaviors (2001) Eleventh International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering, pp. 17-24","Ismail, A.; School of Computer Sciences, , 11800, USM, Penang, Malaysia; email: aisyah@webmail.cs.usm.my",,"Int.

Hajj pilgrims must be well prepared before going to Mecca. They may face complex problems when preparing for and performing hajj. In such situations they require experts' guidance. Accessing information from explicit and tacit knowledge from hajj experts has some limitations in the aspects of availability, time and cost. Thus, it motivates us to propose a hybrid of rule and frame based knowledge representation approach to eliminate current drawbacks on using both methods separately. The main objective is to solve complex and layered problems with regards to hajj rituals. The proposed hajj knowledge base applies the hybrid approach due to several factors such as more structured, support large number of conditions and rules, support complex tasks, more flexible and easy to use. We implement the approach in a prototype. We conducted both lab experiment for comparative study and usability study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The result shows that the hybrid approach never fails to solve problems given since this approach predetermine the problems and solutions before transforming the knowledge into the hajj knowledge base. The knowledge becomes cases to be used in future reasoning. In addition, the approach reduces the time to solve a problem as compared to searching static information via the Internet. © 2009 IEEE.","Case based reasoning; Hajj; Hybrid of rule and frame based; Knowledge base; Knowledge representation","Comparative studies; Complex problems; Complex task; Explicit and tacit knowledge; Hajj; Hybrid approach; Hybrid of rule and frame based; Knowledge base; Static information; Usability studies; Case based reasoning; Knowledge based systems; Pattern recognition; Soft computing; Knowledge representation",,,,,,,"Mahantesh, N., A knowledge-based maintenance programme.

One of the main causes is the failure to manage a journey. Vehicles tend to choose the shortest paths which ended up congesting a certain area. If a journey is well managed, using alternative paths may lead to the same destination in a shorter period of time. Therefore, with the importance of sustainable environment, intelligent route planning system has become a popular research agenda among researchers and industries. In this paper, an enhanced algorithm based on A*-search algorithm is proposed. The enhanced algorithm is used to study the traffic congestion level as well as to suggest the best route to a destination. The algorithm takes the traffic congestion level into consideration, which makes choosing the best route possible in minimal travel time. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Alternative path; Research agenda; Route planning system; Search Algorithms; Shortest path; Sustainable environment; Travel time; Learning algorithms; Routing algorithms; Traffic surveys; Traffic congestion",,,,,,,"National Transportation Studies, , http://www.bts.gov/publications/national-transportation-statistics, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed August 28, 2008; Heavy Traffic Bad For Your Heart (2004) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3761012.stm, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed 21 st October; Keiichi, U., Hideki, S., Tooru, N., Genetic Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem in Delivery System (1994) Vehicle Navigation & Information Systems Conference Proceedings; Ryan, L., Sushil, J.L., Chris, M., Using A Genetic Algorithm To Explore A*-Like Path Finding Algorithms, , Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno; Traffic Congestion, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wikiTraffic-congestion, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed 28 March, 2008; Kenneth, A.B., Paul, J.L., (2005) Algorithms: Sequential, Parallel and Distributed, Thomson Course Technology; A* Search Algorithm, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*-search-algorithm, Available from World Wide Web:, Accessed September 5, 2008; A.

By incorporating the Web portal with a knowledge-based system, knowledge acquisition and sharing will be more efficient. This type of knowledge system is known as knowledge sharing system rather than expert system. Existing SIG portals provide the information by listing the names of the related people in a textual form. Some Web portals reveal the level of expertise of the members but the textual representation does not manage to highlight the different level of expertise among the community explicitly. Thus we have proposed KM-ClaVis approach that consists of a point-based semi automatic classification method to classify the users' expertise levels and the tree view method to visualize the classified expertise of a software engineering interest group (SEIG) e-community.
