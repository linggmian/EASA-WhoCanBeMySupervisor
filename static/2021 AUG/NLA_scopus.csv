Thus, it poses to the increasing number of attacks as a result of using various application and tools. Security warning conveys an alert on the potential harm users might expose such as malware and any kind of attacks on their computer. In practice, most of the end users tend to ignore the security warning as it shows the messages repeatedly, although they have been exposed to many risks. A security warning dialogue is supposed to catch the user’s attention and comprehension however, because of users’ past experiences such habituation makes them became less focus. One-to-one interview session with 60 participants was conducted in order to gain further comprehension among the end users experiencing security warning and to investigate the usability issues of current security warning implementation. It is deemed of necessity to discover these usability issues in the current context of security warning presentations. The result revealed that the problems and challenges continue to persist such as difficulties to make a decision, difficulties to comprehend technical jargons, lack of attractiveness of current security warning and issues of habituation or repeated exposures of warnings. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Human-computer interaction; Security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security","Human computer interaction; Malware; Usability engineering; Empirical investigation; Potential harm; Problems and challenges; Security; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User experience",,,,,,,"Mahajan, A., 3.6 Billion Active Internet Users Worldwide by 2018 with Nearly 50% Penetration, , https://dazeinfo.com/2014/11/26/india-overtake-us-second-largest-internet-user-base-2015-half-world-internet-access-2018-emarketer/, Accessed 31 Sept 2018; Passeri, P., Cyber Attacks Statistics, , https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018/02/22/january-2018-cyber-attacks-statistics/, Accessed 31 Sept 2018; Amran, A., Zaaba, Z., Mahinderjit Singh, M., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings (2017) 4Th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2017, pp. 635-631. , Elsevier B.V., Penang; Wogalter, M., Purposes and scope of warnings (2006) Hum.

One of the widely used assistive technologies is the tactile map that consists of Braille labeling and features annotation. The tactile map enables the visually impaired to understand the geographical information of a particular place. However, despite its wide usage, tactile map still lacks in its usability and availability especially in Malaysia. This paper aims to investigate the usability issues of tactile map, identify the requirements and proposed a conceptual prototype named TacTalk to overcome the usability issues of the existing tactile map. Interviews were conducted with the visually impaired at Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind in Penang. The results shows lack of information, misinterpretation, complexity, and hard to remember the map as the four main usability issues. Hence the proposed solution is named TacTalk, a 'talking tactile map' which consist of a tactile map with embedded buttons that will connect to TacTalk mobile application via Bluetooth to play the audio files once the button is pressed by the user. © 2017 IEEE.","assistive technology; navigation; Tactile map; visually impaired","Navigation; Usability engineering; Vision aids; Assistive technology; Audio files; Geographical information; Malaysia; Mobile applications; Tactile maps; Visually impaired; Maps",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM: 304/PKOMP/6313219

The function of SCM in an ERP is to maintain manufacturing supply chain, which starts from input of data such as bill of material (BOM), planning, and procurement, right up to manufacturing management. BOM is an important input for supply chain management including Material Requirement Planning (MRP), which is one of ERP modules. This study is done at a multi-national company that has implemented ERP but having problems in inventory management on thousands of raw material and parts in production shop floor. Poor inventory management in production floor will cause excess or shortages of raw material which indirectly impact business performance of the company.

In the literature, low health literacy and negative health attitude are the two main causal factors for high number of lifestyle disease. Meanwhile, mobile health or better known as mHealth is found to enhance health literacy and encourage positive health attitude. This study aims to find the relationship between health literacy, health attitude and lifestyle disease for residence in Malaysia. A total of 150 responses have been collected using a questionnaire posted via social media platforms. The findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between health literacy and lifestyle disease as well as health attitude and lifestyle disease. Majority of the respondents have been found to have low health literacy and negative health attitude too. A mHealth application with features of disease information, symptoms checker, calorie counter, medication information and exercise can be proposed with hope to improve health literacy and attitude of Malaysia residence. The proposed features are based on responses solicited from the questionnaire. © 2017 IEEE.","Health Attitude; Health Literacy; Lifestyle Disease; Mobile health; Penang","Health care; Information systems; Metadata; mHealth; Surveys; Health literacy; Lifestyle disease; Malaysia; Penang; Social media platforms; Health",,,,,,,"News, D., (2015) Lifestyle' Diseases Kill Millions Prematurely: WHO; Kariuki, R.M.B., Alexander, E., Lall, S., White, R., Parby, J.I., Huang, C.-Y., Wheeler, S., Shi, T., Harnessing urbanization to end poverty and boost prosperity in Africa : An action agenda for transformation (2013) The World Bank; Zhu, Y.-G., Ioannidis, J.P., Li, H., Jones, K.C., Martin, F.L., (2011) Understanding and Harnessing the Health Effects of Rapid Urbanization in China, , ed: ACS Publications; Steyn, K., Damasceno, A., Lifestyle and related risk factors for chronic diseases (2006) Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, 2, pp. 247-265; Vaartha, M., (2016) Urbanisation among Reasons for Rise in Diseases Like Cancer; Kahn, J.G., Yang, J.S., Kahn, J.S., 'Mobile'health needs and opportunities in developing countries (2010) Health Affairs, 29, pp. 252-258; Stats, I., (2009) Internet Usage Statistics, the Internet Big Picture.

A preliminary study was done to explore the state of OSS implementation among government agencies since the launch of the Malaysian Public Sector OSS Master Plan on July 16, 2004. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions were conducted with IT managers and IT officers in the Northern Region of Peninsular Malaysia. The preliminary study aimed at investigating the usage of OSS and proprietary software, the level of OSS utilisation, the level of OSS knowledge and training of ICT and non-ICT staff, software development and acquisition model, internal OSS manpower capabilities and skills, the user's perception of the advantages of OSS, the user's perception of the risks of OSS, and the problems or barriers in OSS implementation. The results of interviews show that there are many problems or barriers in OSS implementation, e.g. lack of internal OSS expertise, lack of OSS policy, and lack of top management support. Therefore, this study will test the hypotheses on the success factors to OSS implementation in the public sector and to propose a framework for successful OSS implementation in the Malaysian Public Sector. A quantitative approach using survey method via questionnaire will be performed to answer the research question where simple random sampling will be used.

In order to maintain competitiveness, companies need to learn how to manage and leverage on the increase of complexity in their operations. This study seeks to understand the relationship between operational complexity and operational performance of E and E industry in Malaysia. This survey-based study registered a response rate of 17.8% with 111 usable data. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) technique was applied to analyze the data. Operational complexity consists of two dimensions, namely, complicatedness and uncertainty. Meanwhile, operational performance has four dimensions of cost, quality, delivery and flexibility. Both variables are multi-dimensional and modeled as formative second order in PLS-SEM. Results of structural model reveal that operational complexity has a positive impact on operational performance which indicate that the higher the operational complexity, the better the performance. Based on Complex Adaptive System (CAS) in complexity science literature, the relationship between performance and complexity is an inverse U shape curve. This implies that, high operational complexity needs to be managed so as not to reach the threshold of a chaotic stage, which will affect performance. The finding provides insights for managers to cope with increasing operational complexity and to improve performance in the current fast-moving business environment. It also contributes to knowledge in complexity science. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Electrical and electronics; Manufacturing; Operational complexity; Operational performance",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank School of Computer Sciences, Univeristi Sains Malaysia for supporting the publication of this paper.","Ahmad, M.F., Yusof, S.M., Yusof, N.M., Comparative Study Of Quality Practices Between Japanese And Non-Japanese Based Electrical And Electronics Companies In Malaysia: A Survey (2012) Jurnal teknologi, 47, pp. 75-89; Arumugam, V., Ooi, K.-B., Fong, T.-C., TQM practices and quality management performance: An investigation of their relationship using data from ISO 9001:2000 firms in Malaysia (2008) The TQM Journal, 20, pp. 636-650; Bozarth, C.C., Warsing, D.P., Flynn, B.B., Flynn, E.J., The impact of supply chain complexity on manufacturing plant performance (2009) Journal of Operations Management, 27, pp. 78-93; Brown, D., Wilson, S., (2005) The Black Book of Outsourcing, , John Wiley and Sons; Calinescu, A., Efstathiou, J., Schirn, J., Bermejo, J., Applying and Assessing Two Methods for Measuring Complexity in Manufacturing (1998) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, pp. 723-733; Carlisle, Y., McMillan, E., Innovation in organizations from a complex adaptive systems perspective (2006) Emergence: Complexity and Organization, 8, pp. 2-9; Ferdows, K., De Meyers, A., Lasting Improvements in Manufacturing Performance : In Search of a New Theory (1990) Journal of Operations Management, 9, pp. 168-184; Flynn, B.B., Flynn, E.J., Information-Processing Alternatives for Coping with Manufacturing Environment Complexity (1999) Decision Sciences, 30, pp. 1021-1052; (2011) FMM Directory 2011: Malaysian Industries Malaysia, , Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers; Fotopoulos, C.V., Psomas, E.L., The structural relationships between TQM factors and organizational performance (2010) The TQM Journal, 22, pp. 539-552; Frizelle, G., Woodcock, E., Measuring complexity as an aid to developing operational strategy (1995) International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 15, pp. 26-39; Galbraith, J., (1973) Designing Complex Organizations, Reading, , Addison-Wesley Publishing Company; Hair, J., Hult, G.T.M., Ringle, C., Sarstedt, M., (2014) A Primer on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), , Los Angeles, SAGE Publications; Islam, M., Karim, A., Manufacturing practices and performance: Comparison among small-medium and large industries (2011) International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 28, pp. 43-61; MacKenzie, S.B., Podsakoff, P.M., Jarvis, C.B., The problem of measurement model misspecification in behavioral and organizational research and some recommended solutions (2005) Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, p. 710; Mahmud, N., Hilmi, M.F., TQM and Malaysian SMEs Performance: The Mediating Roles of Organization Learning (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 130, pp. 216-225; (2014) Electrical and Electronics, , http://www.matrade.gov.my/en/foriegn-buyers-section/69-industry-write-up--products/557-electrical-a-electronics, Online, Malaysia.Available, Accessed 7 Jun 2014 2014; McKelvey, B., Self-organization, complexity catastrophe, and microstate models at the edge of chaos (1999) Variations in organization science: in honor of Donald T., pp. 279-307. , Campbell; (2007) Malaysian EMS Advantage, , http://www.mida.gov.my/beta/pdf/EMS%20Bro.pdf, Online, Available, Accessed 7 August 2011; (2014) Malaysia Investment Performance Report 2013.

This paper describes the framework and operationalization of the variables before outlining the process of developing the instrument to assess the impact of operational complexity (OC) on quality management (QM) practices and operational performance (OP) relationships in Malaysia's Electrical and Electronics (E&E) manufacturing industry. It also highlights issues of common method bias, reliability and validity of the instrument, pretest method and response rate. The pretest result is then discussed. The paper concludes that personal interviews are especially effective in detecting ambiguity in the instrument. Pilot run provides insights to the challenges ahead such as low response rate, tedious data analysis procedures and enables informed decision to be made in preparation for full-scale data collection. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

However, the recent spate of recalls due to CM poor quality control have triggered the calls to include quality risks as one of the main factors in outsourcing decisions. This paper proposes a conceptual model to implement effective QM practices in the setting of CM industry in Malaysia. Operational complexity (OC) has been identified as the contextual factor in the QM practices-performance model. It is based on contingency theory that implementation of effective QM practices are contextual to organization and not universal.

The industry is lucrative yet challenging. Companies in this industry need to have strong and flexible production system as well as supply chain to cater for diverse customer requirements such as high mix low volume demand. The objective of this paper is to identify the challenges in managing quality effectively and efficiently in a contract-manufacturing environment. Observation and semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand and identify the operational problems in a local EMS company. The problems are then analyzed and generalized against existing quality theories. Interestingly, the findings showed that all the problems have been addressed in the quality theories some 30 years ago. © 2012 Penerbit UTM Press.","Challenges; Electronics manufacturing services; Quality gurus; Quality management; TQM",,,,,,,,"Mucha, S.E., Find It.

Recently, automated checkout shopping trolley technologies have taken a further step than the previous introduced self-checkout system in terms of greater convenience, ease-of-use and greater efficiency. As this technology is considerable new in the market of developing countries, hence it is vital to explore the perception of consumers toward the use of automated checkout trolley. The purpose of this paper is to understand the perceptions and expectations of both enterprise users and end users toward the new checkout system. Findings of this study indicate that both consumers and retailers from developing countries possess positive attitude toward the automated checkout trolley system, and are enthusiastic to try this emerging technology. The main concerns of the users are the secureness of payment and the variability of payment methods, which forms their core criteria in determining whether to adopt the system. The feedbacks from them are valuable in providing better automated checkout system and facilitate adoption rate of the technology.","Automated checkout; Technology management; Technology-based self-service (TBSS)","Automated checkout; Customer values; Ease-of-use; Emerging technologies; End users; Payment methods; Positive attitude; Technology managements; Technology-based; Trolley system; Developing countries; Sales; Technology; Automation",,,,,,,"Anitsal, I., Flint, D.J., Exploring customers' perceptions in creating and delivering value: Technology-based self-service as an illustration (2006) Services Marketing Quarterly, 27 (1), pp. 57-72. , DOI 10.1300/J396v27n01-04; Anitsal, I., Paige, R.C., An exploratory study on consumer perceptions of service quality in technology-based self-service (2006) Services Marketing Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 53-67. , DOI 10.1300/J396v27n03-04; Dabholkar, P.A., Bobbitt, L.M., Lee, E.-J., Understanding consumer motivation and behavior related to self-scanning in retailing implications for strategy and research on technology-based self-service (2003) International Journal of Service Industry Management, 14 (1), pp. 59-95. , DOI 10.1108/09564230310465994; Hsieh, C.-T., Implementing self-service technology to gain competitive advantage (2005) Communications of IIMA, 5, pp. 77-83; Dabholkar, P.A., Consumer evaluations of new technology-based self-service options: An investigation of alternative models of service quality (1996) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 13 (1), pp. 29-51. , DOI 10.1016/0167-8116(95)00027-5; Cho, H., Fiorito, S., Self-service technology in retailing.

Most companies focus on the efficiency of their manufacturing operation and overlooked the importance of managing the Quality Assurance (QA) operation efficiently. QA holds the key to delivery; hence an efficient and effective QA buyoff system is crucial to ensure the company delivers on time. Efficient QA operation requires accurate and reliable inspection data. Therefore, information technology (IT) has to be deployed. This paper identifies the problems in the daily operation, proposes a computerized solution and discusses the benefits of using IT to improve the efficiency of QA operation of a SME in Prai, Penang. A comparison is made for before and after implementation of the system.
