The behaviour of granting permissions requested by apps might expose the Android smartphone user to privacy risks. The existing works lack a formalized mathematical model that can quantify user and system applications risks. No multifaceted data collector tool can also be used to monitor the collection of user data and the risk posed by each application. A benchmark of the risk level that alerts the user and distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable risk levels in Android smartphone user does not exist. Hence, to address privacy risk, a formalized privacy model called PRiMo that uses a tree structure and calculus knowledge is proposed. An App-sensor Mobile Data Collector (AMoDaC) is developed and implemented in real life to analyse user data accessed by mobile applications through the permissions granted and the risks involved. A benchmark is proposed by comparing the proposed PRiMo outcome with the existing available testing metrics. The results show that Tools & Utility/Productivity applications posed the highest risk as compared to other categories of applications. Furthermore, 29 users faced low and acceptable risk, while two users faced medium risk. According to the benchmark proposed, users who faced risks below 25% are considered as safe. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed work is 96.8%. © 2021 by the authors.

Employees, however, have been exposed to different security risks because of working from home. Moreover, the rapid global spread of COVID-19 has increased the volume of data generated from various sources. Working from home depends mainly on cloud computing (CC) applications that help employees to efficiently accomplish their tasks. The cloud computing environment (CCE) is an unsung hero in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. It consists of the fast-paced practices for services that reflect the trend of rapidly deployable applications for maintaining data. Despite the increase in the use of CC applications, there is an ongoing research challenge in the domains of CCE concerning data, guaranteeing security, and the availability of CC applications. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first paper that thoroughly explains the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCE. Additionally, this paper also highlights the security risks of working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021.

The current literature lacks effective solutions for this issue. In this study, the negative impacts of SMS spam were thoroughly analysed, and the existing techniques for SMS spam detection were investigated through two experiments. The first experiment was performed to test and compare the current data mining and cost-sensitive techniques, whereas the second experiment was conducted to test the performance of the proposed technique. Based on the experimental results of the first phase, the most optimal non-cost classifier is a Bayesian network classifier, which is well behaved under the cost-sensitive classifier and obtained the lowest rate of false negative and an acceptable false positive rate. The proposed strategy achieves the best performance in terms of false negative SMS spam classification, obtaining the smallest total expenses and highest precision amongst the compared strategies. © 2020",Cost-sensitive modelling; Data mining technique; Mobile device; Spam text,Bayesian networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Bayesian network classifiers; Cost-sensitive; Effective solution; False negatives; False positive rates; Short messaging service; Spam classification; Spam detection; Data mining,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, I., Guan, D., Chung, T.C., Sms classification based on naive Bayes classifier and apriori algorithm frequent itemset (2014) Int J Mach Learn Comput, 4 (2), p. 183; Almeida, T., Hidalgo, J.M.G., Silva, T.P., Towards SMS spam filtering: results under a new dataset (2013) Int J Infor Sec.

However, female patients often feel reluctant and embarrassed about meeting physicians in person to discuss their intimate body parts, and prefer to use social media for such interactions. Indeed, the number of patients and physicians interacting and seeking information related to breast cancer on social media has been growing. However, a physician may behave inappropriately on social media by sharing a patient's personal medical data excessively with colleagues or the public. Such an act would reduce the physician's trustworthiness from the patient's perspective. The multifaceted trust model is currently most commonly used for investigating social media interactions, which facilitates its enhanced adoption in the context of breast self-examination. The characteristics of the multifaceted trust model go beyond being personalized, context-dependent, and transitive. This model is more user-centric, which allows any user to evaluate the interaction process. Thus, in this study, we explored and evaluated use of the multifaceted trust model for breast self-examination as a more suitable trust model for patient-physician social media interactions in breast cancer screening. Objective: The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify the trustworthiness indicators that are suitable for a breast self-examination system, (2) design and propose a breast self-examination system, and (3) evaluate the multifaceted trustworthiness interaction between patients and physicians. Methods: We used a qualitative study design based on open-ended interviews with 32 participants (16 outpatients and 16 physicians). The interview started with an introduction to the research objective and an explanation of the steps on how to use the proposed breast self-examination system. The breast self-examination system was then evaluated by asking the patient to rate their trustworthiness with the physician after the consultation. The evaluation was also based on monitoring the activity in the chat room (interactions between physicians and patients) during daily meetings, weekly meetings, and the articles posted by the physician in the forum. Results: Based on the interview sessions with 16 physicians and 16 patients on using the breast self-examination system, honesty had a strong positive correlation (r=0.91) with trustworthiness, followed by credibility (r=0.85), confidence (r=0.79), and faith (r=0.79). In addition, belief (r=0.75), competency (r=0.73), and reliability (r=0.73) were strongly correlated with trustworthiness, with the lowest correlation found for reputation (r=0.72). The correlation among trustworthiness indicators was significant (P<.001). Moreover, the trust level of a patient for a particular physician was found to increase after several interactions. Conclusions: Multifaceted trustworthiness has a significant impact on a breast self-examination system. Evaluation of trustworthiness indicators helps to ensure a trustworthy system and ethical interaction between a patient and physician. A new patient can obtain a consultation by referring to the best physician according to preference of other patients. Patients can also trust a physician based on another patient's recommendation regarding the physician's trust level. The correlation analysis further showed that the most preferred trustworthiness indicator is honesty. © 2020 Rajes Khana, Manmeet Mahinderjit Singh, Faten Damanhoori, Norlia Mustaffa.",Breast cancer; Breast self-examination; Health care system; Multifaceted trust; Social media; Trust; Trustworthiness,,,,,,,,,"Bray, F, Ferlay, J, Soerjomataram, I, Siegel, RL, Torre, LA, Jemal, A., Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries (2018) CA Cancer J Clin, 68 (6), pp. 394-424. , Nov; [FREE Full text] [doi] [Medline: 30207593]; (2015) Pusat Data Dan Informasi Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, , http://www.pusdatin.kemkes.go.id/resources/download/pusdatin/infodatin/infodatin-kanker.pdf, InfoDatin Stop Kanker.

As the adoption of WT accelerates and a new level of functionality is introduced, it could potentially open the door to new threats to sensitive information and activities. The study shows that both passive attacks (eavesdropping on the wireless communication) and active attacks (man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack) can be successfully launched by exploiting the security vulnerability of the wearable such as lack of user authentication. Hence, a strong user authentication is required to create trust relationships between users and services and protect users’ data. In this research, a novel authentication protocol using enhanced out-of-band (e-OOBA) two-factor biometric authentication for wearable devices is introduced. The new authentication scheme is known as out-of-band biometrics authentication (OOB-BA) is capable to provide better security and minimize information leakage. The security measurements on this scheme are evaluated and benchmarked. One main finding from security analysis demonstrate that OOB-BA is able to mitigate the security risks such as impersonation attacks leading to stand as an alternative authentication model to be used in future WT adoption. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",biometric; out-of-band; security vulnerabilities and attacks; two-factor authentication; Wearable technology,Biometrics; Network security; Risk assessment; Security systems; Wearable technology; Authentication protocols; Biometric authentication; Biometrics authentication; Man in the middle attacks; Out of band; Security vulnerabilities; Two factor authentication; Wireless communications; Authentication,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/8014003,This work was supported by University Sains Malaysia [grant number: 1001/PKOMP/8014003].,,"Tehrani, K., Michael, A., Wearable technology and wearable devices: Everything you need to know.

This paper discusses a readability issues in privacy policies and how privacy scholars approach the issue. The paper also compares and analyzes research results on readability measurement of privacy policies and divides them into two categories according to different perspective. The perspective includes readability measurement from reader's perspective and readability measurement from privacy policies text content’s perspective. Our finding shows that website providers should give consumers better control regarding their information and give them more freedom in privacy policies. Only then will consumers become liberated from the burden of choosing between 2 unspeakable options. A legally binding document on the privacy policy can be written, that will also be clear and simple to read. © 2020 SERSC.",Information privacy; Privacy; Privacy Policies; Readability; Security,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., (2006) ).

Based on the research, context-aware access control is the best technique to minimise APT instigated by social engineering attacks in smartphones. Therefore, this research proposes an access control model known as sentient-based access control model (SENSATE), which combines role- and attribute-based and multi-level security to maintain information integrity and confidentiality that can be infringed through social engineering attacks. The implementation of existing smartphone sensors in the design of SENSATE is a novel approach in the fight against smartphone cybercrimes, such as APT. © 2019",Advanced persistent threat (APT); Context aware; Role-centric access control; Sensor; Smartphone; Social engineering,Sensors; Smartphones; Access control models; Advanced persistent threat (APT); Context-Aware; Context-aware access control; Information integrity; Mitigation techniques; Multi-level security; Social engineering; Access control,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, MOHE

Physicians have the capacity to share all of their patients’ information with their colleagues without any permission or concern from the patients. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to design a breast self-examination system that can keep monthly track of self-exam data and communication between patient and physician. To develop such a system, identify the ethical values and trustworthiness as an indicator. Then, the survey will provide the details on ethical values and trustworthiness applicable in the system. Therefore, this research objective on the importance of ethical value and trustworthiness in the healthcare system. The survey on 772 respondents leading to the importance of the ethical value being used in the healthcare system is required. The ethical value of interaction, integrity, confidentiality, protection, caring, and fairness have a significant influence on the healthcare system. The path coefficients are answering Hypothesis I in presenting the positive relationship and significant effect between ethical value and BSE system (P<.001). On the other side, trustworthiness has a significant influence on the healthcare system. The path coefficients are answering Hypothesis II in presenting the positive relationship and significant effect between trustworthiness and the BSE system (P<.001). Finally, the relationship in healthcare between trustworthiness and ethical value is on integrity with honesty and belief. © 2020.

After a thorough root-cause analysis based on the Fault Tree Analysis and critical examination of the delayed functioning mechanism, the corrective actions were implemented. Further, the reliability requirements and the delay functioning requirements were met completely during developmental trials. Failures during developmental trials reveal that root cause for defects is due to human error, insufficient quality process, inadequate training and failure in addressing reliability aspects during design stage, etc. To conclude, the lesson learnt from the study was that the stringent reliability analysis of the product should be done, during initial design stage of the product, by identifying potential failure modes of the product and by addressing them prudently. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Failure; Fault tree analysis; Reliability improvement; Root-cause analysis; Single-shot device,,,,,,,,,"Bain, L.J., Engelhardt, M., (1991) Reliability Test Plans for One-Shot Devices Based on Repeated Samples.

Even though there are various cybersecurity solutions in place; the threat of cybercrime is still a hard problem. Exploration of cybercrime challenges, especially the preventions and detections of the cybercrime should be investigated by composing all the stakeholders and players of a cybercrime issue. In this paper; an exploration of several cybercrime stakeholders is done. It is argued that cybercrime is a systemic threat and cannot be tackled with cybersecurity and legal systems.

Mobile application plays a crucial role among smartphone users. It has gained enormous support from the smartphone users ranging from young to elder generations. It is very common to download and install desired mobile applications from application store to aid in completing particular tasks with ease. However, this behavior exposes user towards privacy risk as it has become a concern in smartphone usage. In this research, we propose a mathematical model named Privacy Risk Model (PRiMo) that measures the risk score of a user in smartphone usage. We are approaching the privacy issues in mobile applications from the individual's perspective. We conduct studies on different categories of mobile applications to determine the risk posed by the mobile applications. There is no standardization for residual risk. Therefore, by using the proposed model, we are exploring and creating a standardization for residual risk that becomes a benchmark for user to accept and live with that risk. © 2019 The Authors.",Mobile application; Privacy risk score; Residual risk; Sensitive data risk; Sensor,Behavioral research; Data privacy; Information systems; Information use; Mobile computing; Quality of service; Sensors; Smartphones; Standardization; Application stores; Data exposure; Mobile applications; Privacy preservation; Privacy risks; Quality of service model; Residual risk; Sensitive datas; Risk assessment,,,,,"1001/PKOMP/8014003

However, the reputations of LBS application have raised some privacy and security issues such as location tracked by third parties and creation of fake reviews and events through Sybil attack. Fake events on LBS such as congestion, accidents or police activity affect routes users and fake reviews caused nuisances and decreases trust towards this technology. The current trust model in LBS is single faceted and not personalized. The concept of both trust and distrust are essential criteria of any trust management model to measure the reliability of LBS applications. This paper explores the relationship between trust models and the distrust concept in LBS. By deriving a representation of the multi-faceted model and balance theory conceptualized in a MiniLBS prototype, trust in this technology is quantified. By adopting matrix factorization and probability algorithms on the survey results, the relationship between distrust and trust is further examined and tested. The result obtained from the experiment was nearly zero, the smallest one was 3.0253 × 10-95, and the largest value was only 4.967 × 10-43. The results show that distrust is not a negation of trust. Another crucial finding suggests that balance theory within distrust in the LBS trust model can enhance the trust management model in LBS and indirectly cater issues rise from fake event problem. © 2019 by the authors.",Internet of Things (IoT); Multi-faceted model; Security; Social network service (SNS); Trust,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PNAV/631627,"This research was supported by the Bridging Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/631627.This research received no external funding.",,"Yun, H., Dongho, H., Choong, C.L., Understanding the use of location-based service applications: Do privacy concerns matter?

This concept, when applied in mobile crowd sensing, enables transfer of sensor data from blockchain clients to edge nodes. Edge nodes perform proof-of-work on sensor data from blockchain clients and append validated data to the chain. With this approach, blockchain can be performed pervasively. However, securing sensitive sensor data in a mobile blockchain (client/edge node architecture) becomes imperative. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated framework for mobile blockchain which ensures key agreement between clients and edge nodes using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm. Also, the framework provides efficient encryption of sensor data using the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Finally, key agreement processes in the framework were analyzed and results show that key pairing between the blockchain client and the edge node is a non-trivial process. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.",Edge computing; Internet of Things; Mining; Mobile crowd sensing; Sensor data encryption; Smart contract,,,,,,,,,"Capponi, A., A cost-effective distributed framework for data collection in cloud-based mobile crowd sensing architectures (2017) IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing, 2 (1), pp. 3-16; Biswas, K., Muthukkumarasamy, V., Securing smart cities using blockchain technology. in High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City (2016) IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS), 2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on.

These attacks flood the target network with a large number of packets because of which network becomes incapable of providing the services to its legitimate users. The horrible destruction of DDoS attacks can be seen from the very first attack in 1999 to the recently publicized attack Ababil. Attackers find new ways to launch attacks irrespective of the standard DDoS defense mechanism.

Smart home normally is used to fine-tune human’s daily life. However, the main problem is when different devices such as sensors and electrical appliances produced by different manufacturers being used in a smart home. Each device produced by different manufacturer might come with their own set of communication protocol. Therefore, it is important to have a standardized communication protocol for interconnecting and remotely controlling those devices to ensure data can be transmitted to each other. This project aims to present the Smart Home using MEMS Sensor and Ambient Intelligence (SAHOMASI) where in this paper, a standardized communication protocol is proposed to overcome the above problem.

APT attack has several variants of attacks such social engineering techniques via spear phishing, watering hole and whaling. APTGuard exhibits the ability to predict spear phishing URLs accurately using ensemble learning that combines decision tree and neural network. The URL is obtained from the SMS content received on the smart phones and sent to the server for filtering, classifying, logging and finally informing the administrator of the classification outcome. APTGuard can predict and detect APT from spear phishing but it does not have the ability of automated intervention on the user receiving the spear phishing URL. As a result, APTGuard is capable to extract the features of the URL and then classify it accordingly using ensemble learner which combines decision tree and neural network accurately. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Advanced persistent Threat (APT); Data mining; Ensemble learning; Neural network; Spear-phishing,Android (operating system); Computer crime; Decision trees; Fisheries; Forecasting; Information filtering; Neural networks; Smartphones; Advanced persistent Threat (APT); Android smartphone; Apt attacks; Ensemble learning; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Data mining,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM: 304/PKOMP/650804/M151",This work is supported by USM-Maxis Grant No: 304/PKOMP/650804/M151,,"(2012) Cyber Defense: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and Insider Threat, , https://cyber-defense.sans.org/blog/2012/10/23/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-and-insider-threat, cited 2016 19 September 2016; Tankard, C., Advanced persistent threats and how to monitor and deter them (2011) Network Security, 2011 (8), pp. 16-19; (2016) Anatomy of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Attack, , https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/anatomy-of-a-cyber-attack.html, cited 2016 20 September 2016; Sood, A.K., Enbody, R.J., Targeted cyberattacks: A superset of advanced persistent threats (2013) IEEE Security & Privacy, 11 (1), pp. 54-61; Lab, K., Kaspersky Lab and Synerscope Join Forces to Battle Cyberthreats with Big Data Analytics, , http://www.kaspersky.co.in/about/news/business/2016/Kaspersky-Lab-and-SynerScope-join-forces-to-battle-cyberthreats-with-big-data-analytics, cited 2016 22 September 2016; Krebsonsecurity, , https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/03/seagate-phish-exposes-all-employee-w-2s/, cited 2017 25 April 2017; Best Defense against Spear-Phishing, , https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/best-defense-against-spear-phishing-attacks.html, cited 2017 25 April 2017; Sans-Information Security Resources, , https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what-is-a-false-positive-and-why-are-false-positives-a-problem/2/8, cited 2016 19 September 2016; Sans-Information Security Resources, , https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what-is-a-false-negative/2/9, cited 2016 19 September 2016; Lin, C.-H., (2015) Efficient Spear-Phishing Threat Detection Using Hypervisor Monitor, , Security Technology (ICCST), 2015 International Carnahan Conference on; Research, D., The Impact of Mobile Devices on Information Security: A Surveys of IT Professionals (2013) Dimensional Research; Chen, P., Desmet, L., Huygens, C., (2014) A Study on Advanced Persistent Threats. in IFIP International Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security; Mohammad, R.M., Thabtah, F., McCluskey, L., Intelligent rule-based phishing websites classification (2014) IET Information Security, 8 (3), pp. 153-160; Anatomy of an APT Attack: Step by Step Approach, , http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/anatomy-of-an-apt-attack-step-by-step-approach/, cited 2017 25 April 2017; Basnet, R.B., Sung, A.H., Liu, Q., Rule-based phishing attack detection (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Security and Management-Sam","Chuan, B.L.J.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia; email: bernard.ucom13@student.usm.my",Alfred R.Ibrahim A.A.A.Lim Y.Anthony P.,,Springer Verlag,"5th International Conference on Computational Science and Technology, ICCST 2018",29 August 2018 through 30 August 2018,,217739,18761100,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus been paid to address this issue, the main objective of this paper is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This paper presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this paper could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning,Computer science; Information science; Habituation; security; usability; Usable security; warning; Security of data,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6313287,This work was supported by the short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].,,"Ahmad, R., (2015) Improving computer security warnings, a mental model approach in higher educations, , MSc Thesis, Penang, Malaysia: Universiti Sains Malaysia; Akhawe, D., Felt, A.P., Alice in Warningland: A large-scale field study of browser security warning effectiveness (2013) Proceeding of the 22nd UNISEX Security Symposium, pp. 257-272. , August, Washington, DC: The Advanced Computing Systems Association, &; Anderson, B.B., Kirwan, C.B., Jenkins, J.L., Eargle, D., Howard, S., Vance, A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study (2015) Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2883-2892. , Seoul, Republic of Korea: ACM Digital Library, &; Anderson, B.B., Vance, A., Kirwan, B., Eargle, D., (2014) Users aren’t (necessarily) Lazy: Using NeuroIS to explain habituation to security warnings, , IS Security and Privacy; Bravo-Lillo, C., Cranor, L.F., Downs, J., Komanduri, S., Reeder, R.W., Schechter, S., Sleeper, W., Your attention please: Designing security-decision UIs to make genuine risk harder to ignore (2013) Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), , Newcastle, UK; Bravo-Lillo, C., Cranor, L.F., Downs, J.S., Komanduri, S., Bridging the gap in computer security warnings: A mental model approach. security and privacy (2011) IEEE, 9 (2), pp. 18-26; Bravo-Lillo, C., Cranor, L.F., Downs, J.S., Komanduri, S., POSTER: What is still wrong with security warnings: A mental model approach (2011) Proceeding of the Sixth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, , Redmond, WA; Bravo-Lillo, C.A., (2014) Improving computer security dialogs: An exploration of attention and habituation, , PhD Thesis, Carnegie Mellon University; Brustoloni, J.C., Villamarin-Salomon, R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs (2007) Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85. , Pittsburgh, PA:, &; Camp, J., Asgharpour, F., Liu, D., (2008) Experimental evaluations of expert and non-expert computer users mental model of security risks, , Bloomington, IN: School of Informatics, Indiana University; Craik, K.J.W., The nature of explanation, Cambridge University Press (1943) Philosophy, 19 (73), pp. 173-174; Dourish, P., Anderson, K., Privacy, security… and risk and danger and secrecy and trust and identity and morality and power: Understanding collective information practices (2004) Report No. UCI-ISR-05-1, , Irvine, Canada: UCI Institute for Software Research; Edward, W.K., Poole, S.E., Stoll, J., Security automation considered harmful?

It significantly improves users’ experience during sensing activities since their active involvement in the labeling process is reduced. An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of “non-sensitive” and “sensitive” data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Naïve Bayes classifier. With the hybridized machine learning (unsupervised and supervised) technique presented in this paper, unlabeled sensor data was automatically annotated and then classified. © 2018 by the authors.",Activity recognition; Clustering; Data security; Multivariate data; Sensitive data,Location; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Security of data; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Activity recognition; Automatic annotation; Clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Location information; Multivariate data; Sensitive datas; Clustering algorithms,,,,,,,,"Capponi, A., Fiandrino, C., Kliazovich, D., Bouvry, P., Giordano, S.A., Cost-effective distributed framework for data collection in cloud-based mobile crowd sensing architectures (2017) IEEE Trans.

This study provides an empirical model to detect individual terrorist using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiling. In the research design and analysis approach, four metric values of DNA materials guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine form a dataset were assigned to a sample of a hundred people and tested using regression analysis. The tests were conducted to generate a mathematical model that minimizes errors in the experiment. After model evaluations and validations, the result shows 99.43% detection rate accuracy. The model was used to measure the weight of individual involvement in crime such as cybercrime, and terrorism as presented by the people’s DNA test. The result from this study performs better when compared with the recent studies of other state-of-the-art techniques such as text analysis, machine learning algorithms, data mining, high efficiency video coding detection and statistical mixture models identification.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn, and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus paid to address this issue, the main objective of this article is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This article presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges, and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this article could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning,Computer science; Information science; Habituation; security; usability; Usable security; warning; Security of data,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6313287,This work was supported by a short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].,,,"Zaaba, Z.F.email: zarulfitri@usm.my",,,Taylor and Francis Inc.,,,,,19393555,,,,English,Inf.

Tor protect its user privacy against surveillance and censorship using strong encryption and obfuscation techniques which makes it extremely difficult to monitor and identify users' activity on the Tor network. It also implements strong defense to protect the users against traffic features extraction and website fingerprinting. However, the strong anonymity also became the heaven for criminal to avoid network tracing. Therefore, numerous of research has been performed on encrypted traffic analyzing and classification using machine learning techniques. This paper presents survey on existing approaches for classification of Tor and other encrypted traffic. There is preliminary discussion on machine learning approaches and Tor network. Next, there are comparison of the surveyed traffic classification and discussion on their classification properties. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.",Encrypted traffic monitoring; Machine learning; Security; Survey; Tor,,,,,,,,,"Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Syverson, P., 'Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router,' (2004) SSYM'04 Proc. 13th Conf.

For digitalisation enhancing innovations in developing countries and poverty presents unique challenges. E-commerce in layman's term refers to the activity of buying and selling over the Internet. Many young entrepreneurs and individual Islamic businesses have a website set up to catch up to technology and to advertise or promote their products. However, young entrepreneurs do not employ an e-commerce solution. This paper aims to develop simplicity to create an e-commerce store to allow and to sell products over the Internet. In addition, young entrepreneurship development from an Islamic perspective. The proposed solution includes extracting the product information available to the user and then set up a generic secure e-commerce prototype aim to store information from existing non-e-commerce website selling products. The prototype designed in this provides standard features of a common online store, shopping cart and payment solutions. A mobile version of the online store is also designed for further easing the process of purchasing products for the customer as mobile computing is on the rise and people are getting more and more reliable on their smartphone to perform various tasks. This paper emphasises the need for young entrepreneurs to understand digitalisation as an integral part of the dynamic business sustainability nexus and the new global business equation. The proposed tool is helpful for the government, policymaker, potential young entrepreneurs and others existing entrepreneurs of Muslim countries, Islamic scholars and academicians. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The utilization of NFC technology in U-Learning concept will help to improve accessibility and encourage collaborative learning methods in the education sector. In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate eleven (11) adoptions factors of U-Learning with NFC and ranking them using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. We also utilized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology Readiness (TR), and combination of TAM and TR (TRAM) as theoretical framework. We have identified TRAM as the best tool based on literature review and utilized the theory to propose an NFC-Enabled Ubiquitous Technology model. The model was utilized to design a questionnaire for survey about user acceptance. Results from the online survey were analyzed using AHP in an absolute measurement approach method. Results from AHP show that optimism is the most influencing factor in adoption of U-Learning using NFC technology followed by innovativeness and accessibility. Finally, this paper contributes in designing an NFC research model. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.",Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); Multi criteria decision making (MCDM); Ubiquitous learning (U-Learning); Virtual learning,,,,,,,,,"Ebner, M., Maierhuber, M., Near Field Communication-Which Potentials Does NFC Bring for Teaching and Learning Materials?

During mobile sensing, data mostly contain sensitive information of users such as their real-time location. When such information are not effectively secured, users’ privacy can be violated due to eavesdropping and information disclosure. In this paper, we demonstrated the possibility of unauthorized access to location information of a user during sensing due to the ineffective security mechanisms in most sensing applications. We analyzed 40 apps downloaded from Google Play Store and results showed a 100% success rate in traffic interception and disclosure of sensitive information of users. As a countermeasure, a security scheme which ensures encryption and authentication of sensed data using Advanced Encryption Standard 256-Galois Counter Mode was proposed. End-to-end security of location and motion data from smartphone sensors are ensured using the proposed security scheme. Security analysis of the proposed scheme showed it to be effective in protecting Android based sensor data against eavesdropping, information disclosure and data modification. © 2018 The Authors",Advanced encryption standard; Authentication; Dynamic analysis; Encryption; Galois counter mode; Secure socket layer,,,,,,,,,"Guo, B., Yu, Z., Zhou, X., Zhang, D., From participatory sensing to mobile crowd sensing , pp. 593-598. , Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops), 2014 IEEE International Conference on. 2014, IEEE; (2016), http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3175418, Gartner, Connected Things in Smart Cities.

The modeling method is an empirical formula for measuring individual actor's level of involvement in terrorism crime. Terrorists are gaining ground virtually in the most nation of the world. This has become a global challenge as the attacks have recorded millions of deaths of innocent people, incapacitated people, and destroyed properties. In addition, the attacks rendered most communities and countries economically dormant and create a complex crisis among the people. In the research approach, the mathematical model developed is used to detect person's involvement in terrorism. Furthermore, the mathematical model result can be used to predict or calculate the outcome of the dependent parameter from the varying independents. In conclusion, the research objectives were achieved as there was a record of 0.26495 or 26.495% prediction on the overall test which determined the levels of optimization and improvement. Thus, we recommend that people's profiling analysis has a significant contribution to terrorist detecting if integrated into the system as a solution to terrorist attacks. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

Many of these devices rely on personal identification numbers (PIN) as a form of user authentication. One of the main concerns in the use of mobile devices is the possibility of a breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. Threats can possibly come from friends as well as strangers. Smart devices can be easily lost due to their small size, thereby exposing details of users’ private lives. User behavior authentication is designed to overcome this problem by utilizing user behavioral techniques to continuously assess user identity. This study proposed a behavioral data profiling technique that utilizes data collected from the user behavior application to verify the identity of the user in a continuous manner. By utilizing a combination of analytical hierarchy process and correlation coefficient method, the best experimental results were obtained by verifying the identity of six types of user behaviors to determine the different behaviors. Based on the results, this study proposes a new authentication technique that enables verification of a user’s identity through their application usage in a transparent manner. Behavioral data profiling is designed in a modular manner that will not reject user access based on a single application activity but on several consecutive abnormal application usages to balance the trade-off between security and usability. The proposed framework is evaluated using a PIN-based technique and achieved an overall 95% confidence level. Behavioral data profiling provides a significant improvement in the security afforded to the device and user convenience. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Correlation coefficient; Decision-making; Security of smartphone; User behavior,Authentication; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Abnormal applications; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Authentication techniques; Correlation coefficient; Correlation coefficient method; Personal identification number; Security and usabilities; User behaviors; Behavioral research,,,,,,,,"Guo, C., Wang, H.J., Zhu, W., Smart-phone attacks and defenses (2004) Hotnets, p.

The existing OPAC platform acts as a search engine for reading materials in the library is commonly complicated and not user friendly. The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is introduced in this project as part of a mobile application. NFC is a set of protocols on portable devices which perform wireless and contact-less short range, two-way communication between compatible devices. Transmission of data between devices is completed over radio waves and magnetic induction with passive NFC devices. As mobile devices, especially smartphones are more commonly utilized by users all around the world including university students, the proposed system would be able to enhance the performance of a library to be more convenient, secure, and more user friendly. Indirectly, the development of this mobile application can improve the visitation rates of students to the library by simplifying the searching, tracking reading materials and borrowing activities. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.",Android-based application; Library system; Mobile application; NFC technology; Smart university,Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio transmission; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Library systems; Mobile applications; Nfc technologies; Smart universities; The near field communication (NFC); Transmission of data; Two way communications; University students; Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Villen-Rueda, L., Senso, J.A., De Moya-Anegón, F., The use of OPAC in a large academic library: A transactional log analysis study of subject searching (2007) J Acad Librarianship, 33 (3), pp. 327-337; Arshad, A., Shafique, F., What do users prefer, card catalogue or OPAC?

The challenge of the growing ageing population is health and social care services. As the population lives longer, the costs of institutional care rises and elderly who not able live independently in their own homes without caregivers. Moreover, it restricted their activity area, safety and freedom in their daily life. Hence, a tracking system is worthy for their caregivers to track their real-time location with efficient. Currently tracking and monitoring systems are unable to satisfy the needs of the community. Hence, Indoor-Outdoor Elderly Secure and Tracking care system (IOET) proposed to track and monitor elderly. This Mobile Crowdsensing type of system is using indoor and outdoor positioning system to locate elder which utilizes the RFID, NFC, biometric system and GPS aim to secure the safety of elderly within indoors and outdoors environment. A mobile application and web-based application to be designed for this system. This system able to real-time tracking by combining GPS and NFC for outdoor coverage where ideally in smart city. In indoor coverage, the system utilizes active RFID tracking elderly movement. The system will prompt caregiver wherever elderly movement or request by using the notification service which provided the real-time notify.

E-learning is known as a learning tool which based on technology to deliver learning material electronically through computer network. The involvement of the students and the lecturers in the existing learning system is not interactive as they use it as a medium to deliver notes and receive notes only. The traditional attendance system which passes the attendance sheet around the class or by calling names is also not productive and time consuming to process the data into attendance statistics. Therefore, an interactive learning system embedded with NFC attendance system using NFC enabled smartphone known as NFC Interactive LEarning System (NILES) is proposed to take attendances and lecturers can conduct their classes in a more interactive way in school, college or university through the usage of social media and blended learning tools. The proposed solution can provide a convenient and portable classroom learning system to the universities and colleges to improve the interaction learning process among students and reduce the workload of lecturers in processing the attendance statistics.

It provide significant preliminary insights and evidences on what elements that end-users able to comprehend and not. The results indicated that technical terminology became the main issues that made end-users in baffle. Most of them agreed that signal icons should be remained in the warning as risk indicator for them before making security decision. It is expected the results can be useful for the research community and developers in the security warnings domain. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Human computer interaction; Security warnings; Usability; Usable security; User study,,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,"I would like to thank to all who involves in this study especially to School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.",,"http://www.internetlivestats.com/internetusers/#sources; Zaaba, Z.F., (2014) Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (ASIA), , Ph.D. Thesis, University of Plymouth; Bravo-Lillo, C., Cranor, L.F., Downs, J.S., Komanduri, S., POSTER: What is still wrong with security warnings: A mental models approach (2010) Proceedings of the Sixth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, Redmond, WA; Bravo-Lillo, C., Cranor, L.F., Downs, J.S., Komanduri, S., Bridging the gap in computer security warnings: A mental model approach (2011) Security and Privacy, IEEE, 9, pp. 18-26; Bravo-Lillo, C., Cranor, L.F., Downs, J.S., Komanduri, S., Sleeper, M., Improving computer security dialogs (2011) Human-Computer Interaction— INTERACT 2011, 6949, pp. 18-35; Furnell, S.M., Jusoh, A., Katsabas, D., Dowland, P.S., Considering the usability of end-user security software (2006) Proceedings of 21St IFIP International Information Security Conference (IFIP SEC 2006), pp. 307-316. , Karlstad, Sweden; Wogalter, M.S., (2006) Purposes and Scope of Warnings, Handbook of Warnings, Lawrence Erlbaum Associate, USA, pp. 3-9. , ISBN 0-8058-4724-3; Wu, M., Miller, R.C., Garfinkel, S.L., Do security toolbars actually prevent phishing attacks?

Breast cancer cannot be detected easily in the early stage of the tumor development. This is one of the reasons why patient only seeks help from the doctor when the tumor is already in a critical stage. This research proposes to diagnose the type of lump of breast lump among woman by using data mining algorithm which could help the medical practitioner to diagnose breast lumps without the intervention of surgical biopsy. The dataset used for the research are obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison in the United States of America (USA) which was collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg. Five different algorithms are used to analyze the breast cancer data set is applied to determine the level of accuracy for each algorithm in detecting whether the patient’s breast lump is cancerous or non-cancerous. Overall, ADTree has higher accuracy with missing values and Random Forest has highest ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) of 99.3% without missing values. ROC is the value under curve that use binary classification between true positive rate and false positive rate and examine the output of the classifier. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Breast cancer; Classifier; Data mining,,,,,,,,,"Ma, J., Ahmedin, J., (2013) Breast Cancer Metastasis and Drug Resistance, , http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5647-6_1; Komen, S.G., (2014) Facts for Life: What is Breast Cancer?, , http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedfiles/Content_Binaries/806-368a.pdf; (2014), http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/document/acspc-042725.pdfK, American Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Facts and Figures 2013-2014, American Cancer Society, Inc., Atlanta, Elissa, “Title of paper if known,” unpublished; Ann Clark, R., (1997) The Biology of Breast Cancer, Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in New York State; Kharya, S., (2012) Using Data Mining Techniques for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Cancer Disease, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1205, 1923; Ahmad, L.G., Eshlaghy, A.T., Poorebrahimi, A., Ebrahimi, M., Razavi, A.R., (2013) J.

These technologies are a portion of wireless communication technology. Even though NFC technologies benefit in various field, but it’s still exposed to multiple type of privacy attacks and threat as well since the communication occur in an open environment. The filtering technique been perform on the tag in order to get access to the embedded information. As solution based on tag filtering techniques, existing NFC filtering, Intent filtering has merged together with Bloom filtering from RFID technology. This help in term of elimination the duplicate tag and verify the receiving tag. Meanwhile, as a content protection to NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) message been transmitted through the communication channel, Advance Encryption Standard (AES) 128bit has been implemented on the NDEF message. AES provide solution to encrypt the NDEF message which has been communicated. Bloom filtering performed the hashing operation using MD5 technique as a verification of registered user to the NFC system. While the default Intent filtering direct the user to the selected invocation as registered on the tag after the Bloom filtering verification. Besides that, implementation of AES cryptographic in NDEF message, took approximately about 80 trillion years++ to crack the key using brute force attack. Communication of two legitimate entities is secured with AES encryption. Hence, secured user validation or filtering with encrypted message, prevent the possibility for MITM attacker to retrieve sensitive or personal information. The overall framework provide a better security solution compare to the existing framework. © 2017 ASTES Publishers.

Through these functionalities, Smartphone owner can exchange information to each other by sharing links or even files. However, an attacker see these as an advantage to perform an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT is an attack which incorporates both social engineering attack and malware. In this paper, the authors will shed light on how APT attack through spear phishing can occur in Smartphone and how to detect it. First, the authors will examine the tactics that can be used by the attacker to perform a successful social engineering attack. Then, based on the discussion that has been made, the authors have used a machine learning algorithm to classify whether a certain URL is a phish or not. Lastly, the authors have evaluated the propose technique using machine learning and obtained more than 90% accuracy. This proves, that the proposed technique would able to help mitigating APT attack through spear phishing in the Smartphone. © 2018 The Authors.",Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Cyber Crime; Decision Tree; Smart Phone; Typosquat,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Decision trees; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Smartphones; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Attack detection; Cyber-crimes; Multi-purpose; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Typosquat; Malware,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.,,"APT Research Team TrendLab, Spear-phishing email: Most favored apt attack bait (research paper), Report (2012); Baumgartner, K., Raiu, C., Maslennikov, D., (2013) Android Trojan Found in Targeted Attack, , https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/35552/android-trojan-found-in-targeted-attack-58/, [Online].

Security warning is designed to warn the users such as notify, inform and advice users about the consequence effect of an action. However, computer user s tend to ignore security warning due to the lack of attentions, did not understand the meaning of the warnings, difficulties on the technical jargon used, lack of motivation and users become habituated to security warning. Therefore, a survey was mounted online utilising 156 participants to investigate and to understand further general understanding of user's perceptions on security warnings. This paper describes two main findings utilising Chi-Square and Cramer's V test. The findings suggested that in all three scenarios, the results were not statistically significant. However, results portrayed in Cramer's V test were in a better outlook. The result indicates on the need to look closely on each variable involves within the study sampling to improve the security warnings. © 2018 The Authors.",Chi Square; Cramer's V Test; Human Computer Interaction; Security Warning; Usability; Usable Security,Information systems; Surveys; Chi Square; Computer users; End users; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User's perceptions; Human computer interaction,,,,,,,,"Zaaba, Z.F., (2014) Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (Asia), , PhD Thesis, University of Plymouth; Bravo-Lillo, C.A., (2014) Improving Computer Security Dialogs: An Exploration of Attention and Habituation, , PhD Thesis, Carnegie Mellon University; (2015) Microsoft,Warning Messages, , https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn742473.aspx, [Online] Available at: [Accessed: 20 September 2016]; Wu, M., Miller, C.R., Garfinkel, S.L., (2006) Do Security Toolbars Actually Prevent Phishing Attacks, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference of Human Factors in Computing System, pp. 601-610. , ISB 1-59593-372-7; Seifert, C., Welch, I., Komisarczuk, P., (2006) Effectiveness of Security by Admonition: A Case Study of Security Warnings in A W Eb Browser Setting, , School of Mathematics, Statistic and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington; Sharek, D., Swofford, C., Wogalter, M., (2008) Failure to Recognize Fake Internet Pop Up Warning Message, Proceeding of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 52nd Annual Meeting, pp. 557-580; Sunshine, J., Egelmen, S., Almuhimedi, H., Atri, N., Cranor, L.F., Crying Wolf: An empirical study of ssl warning effectiveness (2009) Proceedings of the 18th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 229-416. , Montreal Canada; Egelmen, S., (2009) Trust Me: Design Patterns for Constructions Trustworthy Trust Indicators, , PhD Thesis, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University; Furnell, S.M., Jusoh, A., Katsabas, A., The challenge of understanding and using security: A survey of end -users (2006) Computer and Security, the International Source of Innovation for the Innovation Security and IT Audit Pr Ofessional; Zaaba, Z.F., Teo, K.B., Examination on usability issues of security warning dialogs (2015) Journal of Multidisciplinary Engineering Science and Technology, 2 (6), pp. 1337-1345; Raja, F., Hawkey, K., Hsu, S., Wang, K.L.C., Beznosov, K., A brick wall, a lock door and a bandit: A physical metaphor for firewall warnings (2011) Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 1-20. , Pittsburg, USA; Brusoloni, J.C., Villamarin-Salomon, R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs (2007) Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85. , Pittsburg, USA; Anderson, B.B., Kirwan, C.B., Jenkins, J.L., Eargle, D., Howard, S., Vance, A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study Processing of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, p. 2883. , 2892; Krol, K., Moroz, M., Sasse, M.A., Don't work.

Higher education institutions also faced the same threat since BYOD has been adopted into their institution. In this paper, a simulation on watering hole attack and spear phishing; comparison between these two APT variants, as well as the survey design based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) are presented. The result of the survey is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The result demonstrated that severity factor and vulnerability factor moderately explained the Protection Behaviour factor; and Protection Behaviour factor is a moderately strong predictor to self-efficacy, but avoidance behavior does not predict self-efficacy directly. Based on this result, a set of security policy for hindering watering hole and spear phishing attack is designed and implemented. The new policy will then be adapted to the university e-learning portal. © 2018 The Authors.",Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD); Cyber Crime; Smartphone; Watering Hole,Crime; Education; Information systems; Surveys; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Cyber-crimes; Higher education institutions; Protection motivation theory; Security strategies; Vulnerability factors; Watering Hole; Computer crime,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.,,"Bichsel, J., Dahlstrom, E., (2014) Ecar Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, , Educause, Louisville; Bann, L.L., Singh, M.M., Samsudin, A., Trusted security policies for tackling advanced persistent threat via spear phishing in byod environment (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 72, pp. 129-136. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915035747; Zulkei, Z., Mahinderjit-Singh, M., Malim, N., AdvancedPersistentThreatMitigationUsingMultiLevelSecurity AccessControlFramework, Vol. 9158 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 90-105. , Springer International Publishing, 2015, book section 7; Herath, T., Rao, H.R., Protection motivation and deterrence: A framework for security policy compliance in organisations (2009) European Journal of Information Systems, 18 (2), pp. 106-125; Dang-Pham, D., Pittayachawan, S., Comparing intention to avoid malware across contexts in a byod-enabled Australian university: A protection motivation theory approach (2015) Computers & Security, 48, pp. 281-297; Vance, A., Siponen, M., Pahnila, S., Motivating is security compliance: Insights from habit and protection motivation theory (2012) Information & Management, 49 (3), pp. 190-198; Pillay, A., Diaki, H., Nham, E., Senanayake, S., Tan, G., Deshpande, S., Does Byod Increase Risks or Drive Benefits?; La Polla, M., Martinelli, F., Sgandurra, D., A survey on security for mobile devices (2013) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15 (1), pp. 446-471; Krombholz, K., Hobel, H., Huber, M., Weippl, E., Advanced social engineering attacks (2015) Journal of Information Security and Applications, 22, pp. 113-122; (2012) Spear-phishing Email: Most Favored Apt Attack Bait (Research Paper), , A.

A prototype home control and monitoring system is being proposed to have their safety taken over, allowing the elderly to live independently as well as lessening the burden of caregivers. Caregivers will be able to monitor the daily lives of elderly citizens under their care effectively and in a noninvasive manner. In this work, we will be using Arduino and several other sensors, in an effort to provide around the clock monitoring of the elderly people.

However, issue arises when cyberbullies are able to reach their victims through these social media platforms. There are different types of cyberbullying and like traditional bullying; it causes victims to feel overly selfconscious, increases their tendency to self-harm and generally affects their mental state negatively. Such situations occur due to security issues such as user anonymity and the lack of content restrictions in some social networks or web forums. In this paper, we highlight the existing solutions, which are Intrusion Prevention System and Intrusion Detection System from a number of researchers. However, even with such solutions, cyberbullying acts still occurs at an alarming rate. As such, we proposed an alternative solution that aims to prevent cyberbullying activities at a younger age, e.g., young children. The application would provide an alternative method to preventing cyberbullying activities among the younger generations in the future. © 2017 KIPS.",Cyberbullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion detection system; Mobile application; Social network,Computer crime; Mercury (metal); Social networking (online); Alternative solutions; Cyber bullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion prevention systems; Mobile applications; Social media platforms; Younger generations; Intrusion detection,,,,,,,,"Hanna, R., Rohm, A., Crittenden, V.L., ""We're all connected: the power of the social media ecosystem,"" (2011) Business Horizons, 54 (3), pp. 265-273; Wall, D.S., (2007) Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, , Cambridge, MA: Polity Press; Hinduja, S., Patchin, J.W., ""Bullying, cyberbullying, and suicide,"" (2010) Archives of Suicide Research, 14 (3), pp. 206-221; Patchin, J.W., Hinduja, S., (2012) Cyberbullying Prevention and Response: Expert Perspectives, , New York, NY: Routledge; Ribble, M., (2011) Digital Citizenship in Schools, , 2nd ed.

However, WID still faces several challenges and issues while implementing and evaluating in Supply Chain Management technologies. Due to security concern, the SCM data are exposed to active and passive attacks that lead to counterfeiting attacks: fraud and cloned attacks. For an organization data most treasured assets, information sharing between different companies become an issue. This is because different organizations have dfferent role and responsibilities in data management and security policies in their environment. We propose testing and evaluating techniques for access control model policies. Based on findings, we have chosen Role Base Access Control (RBAC) most suitable canddate for an access control model.

Six-Sigma is a quality improvement approach that aims to reduce the number of defects up to 3.4 parts per million. In the last three decades, it helped several companies to enhance the capability of their processes and to increase the level of quality of their product or service. This case study based research deals with application of DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) methodology of Six-Sigma to reduce the machine downtime for process improvement. The tools and techniques used during the analysis are Process Mapping (SIPOC Diagram), Process Flow Chart, Process Capability Analysis, Histogram, Pareto Chart, Pie Chart, Cause and Effect Diagram, Brainstorming, Affinity Diagram and ANOVA. The results of this study show that sigma value has improved from 2.79-2.85 Sigma. This study also highlighted the five critical problems (reasons) of downtime which are, i.e., electricity problem, shortage of material, quality issues, machine fault and reactive maintenance. The valuable principles and practices of Six-Sigma will do well by continuously refining the organizational culture. Time and commitment both are required and compulsory to bring change in cultural before they are strongly implanted into the organization. I do assure that this research study will provide opportunities to the organizations for the better implementation of Six-Sigma projects. © Medwell Journals, 2016.",Organizational culture; Process improvement; Project management; Quality; Six-Sigma,,,,,,,,,"Al-Sagheer, A., Applying Six-Sigma to achieve enterprise sustainability: preparations and aftermath of Six-Sigma projects (2011) J.

Age society often suffers from common problems such as Alzheimer's disease that disrupts their daily life. Moreover, it restricted their activity area, safety and freedom in their daily life. Hence, a tracking system is good for their relatives or guardian to track their location and path. When the population of aged society increases and the number of elders being lost increases, current tracking and monitoring systems are unable to satisfy the needs of the community. Hence, a smart tracking and monitoring system that automatically tracks and monitor these elderly person is required. INdoor-OuTdoor Elderly CAring SystEm (NOTECASE) is a real-time tracking and monitoring system that utilizes the RFID, Wi-Fi, and Global Location Positioning System (GPS) aim to track and monitor the aged society, both within indoors and outdoors environment.

Existing researches have shown that new systems require novice users to spend an amount of time to get to know the technology. Near Field Communication (NFC) is an emerging technology, which offers an enhanced interaction for users by simplifying data transfers, secured payment transaction access and many more. In this paper, we looked into a number of widely used acceptance models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory Planned Behavior (TPB) and, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to identify the theory that is best suited as an assessment tool of the user acceptance to the NFC technology. We have identified UTAUT as the best tool based on literature and utilized the theory to develop a questionnaire for the user acceptance survey. Our results indicates, factors such as social influence and facilitating condition affected the users' technology acceptance for NFC where most respondents are willing to use the technology if they had the chance to do so. © 2015 IEEE.",Near Field Communication; Technology Acceptance Model; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology,Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Industrial management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Surveys; Emerging technologies; Facilitating conditions; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; The near field communication (NFC); The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Theory of reasoned action; Unified theory; Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Steffen, R., Preiinger, J., Schöllermann, T., Müller, A., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an automative environent (2010) Second International Workshop on Near Field Communication, pp. 15-20. , April; Dillon, A., Morris, M., User acceptance of information and technology: Theories and models (1996) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 31, pp. 3-32; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340; Venkatesh, V., Davis, F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) Management Science, 2, pp. 186-204. , February; Venkatesh, V., Creation of favorable user perceptions: Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation (1999) MIS Quarterly, 2, pp. 239-260. , June; Venkatesh, V., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 425-478. , September; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Believe, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior:An Introduction to Theory and Research, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Au, S., Parameswaran, N., Problem solving with attitude and the theory of reasoned action (2003) IEEE/WIC International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology IEEE, pp. 1-4. , October; Teh, P., Ahmed, P.K., MOA and TRA in social Commerce: An intergrated model (2011) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management Singapore IEEE, pp. 1375-1378. , December; Sogani, S., Muduganti, R., Hexmoor, H., Davis, F., Introducing agent based implementation of the theory of reasoned action: A case study in user acceptance of computer technology (2005) KIMAS International Conference IEEE, pp. 507-510. , April; Ajzen, I., (2006) Constructing A Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire, pp. 1-12. , http://people.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.measurement.pdf; Lin, T.C., Hsu, M.H., Kuo, F.Y., Sun, P.C., An intention Model-based study of software piracy (1999) 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences IEEE, , January; Lu, Y., Zhou, T., Wang, B., Exploring Chinese user' acceptance of instant messaging using the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, and the flow theory (2009) Computer in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 29-39. , January; Lin, J., Chan, H.C., Wei, K.K., Understanding competing web application platforms : An extended theory of planned behavior and its relative model (2011) Engineering Management, 58. , February; Wu, Y., Tao, Y., Yang, P., Using UTAUT to explore the behavior of3G mobile communication users (2007) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) Singapore IEEE, pp. 209-212. , December; Gao, T., Deng, Y., A study on users' acceptance behavior to mobile E-books application based on UTAUT model (2012) ICSESS3rd International Conference Beijing IEEE, p. 376. , June",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2nd International Symposium on Technology Management and Emerging Technologies, ISTMET 2015",25 August 2015 through 27 August 2015,,118506,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Int.

Trust concerns have been raised and the trustworthiness of social networking sites has been questioned. Currently, the trust in social networks is using the single- faceted approach, which is not well personalized, and doesn't account for the subjective views of trust according to each user, but only the general trust believes of a group of population. From our initial survey, we had found that most people can share their information without any doubts on OSN but they normally do not trust all their friends equally and think there is a need of trust management. By adopting the idea of multi-faceted trust model, a user-centric model that can personalize the comments/photos in social network with user's customized traits of trust is proposed.

It is important that health care organizations are equipped with reliable software and statistical tools to analyze the vast amount of available data that can aid in the early detection of breast cancer. This paper demonstrates how the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) Methodology can be enlisted to filter such data in order to select the major attributes identified as significant factors in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Following this methodology, five classifiers will be tested out by using the WEKA software and the accuracy rate of each classifier applied to the dataset of breast cancer will be observed. These are Naive Bayes, random forest, decision tree, ZeroR and OneR. The accuracy rate of each as applied to the dataset of breast cancer markers was observed. Based on these trials, the Naive Bayes classifier has been selected as the best data mining method.",Attributes; Breast cancer; Naive Bayes classifier; WEKA,Algorithms; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Competition; Decision trees; Diseases; Filtration; Information management; Innovation; Learning systems; Regional planning; Software testing; Statistical mechanics; Attributes; Breast Cancer; Classification algorithm; Early detection of breast cancer; Healthcare organizations; Knowledge discovery in database; Naive Bayes classifiers; WEKA; Data mining,,,,,,,,"Abdullah, N.A., Wan Mahiyuddin, W., Muhammad, N.A., Ali, Z.M., Ibrahim, L., Ibrahim Tamim, N., Survival rate of breast cancer patients in Malaysia: A population-based study (2013) Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 14, pp. 4591-4594; Americancancersociety, Cancer Facts & Figures 2015 (2015) IJIKM, p. 9. , Atlanta.

However, Salsa20/7 is broken and Salsa20/12 is not as safe as before. Therefore, Salsa20 must completely perform all of the four rounds of encryption to achieve a good diffusion in order to resist the known attacks. In this paper, a new variant of Salsa20 that uses the chaos theory and that can achieve diffusion faster than the original Salsa20 is presented. The method has been tested and benchmarked with the original Salsa20 with a series of tests. Most of the tests show that the proposed chaotic Salsa of two rounds is faster than the original four rounds of Salsa20/4, but it offers the same diffusion level. © 2015 KIPS.",Chaos theory; Cryptography; Differential attacks; Hash function; Logistic map; Salsa20; Stream cipher,Chaos theory; Diffusion; Hash functions; Chaotic logistic maps; Differential attacks; Logistic maps; Salsa20; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,,,,,,,,"De Canniere, C., Preneel, B., (2008) Trivium,"" in New Stream Cipher Designs, pp. 244-266. , Heidelberg: Springer; Bernstein, D.J., The Salsa20 family of stream ciphers (2008) New Stream Cipher Designs, pp. 84-97. , Heidelberg: Springer; Mukherjee, P., An overview of eSTREAM ciphers (2013) Centre of Excellence in Cryptology, , Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India; Crowley, P., Truncated differential cryptanalysis of five rounds of Salsa20 (2005) The eSTREAM Project, , Technical Report 2005/073; Aumasson, J.P., Fischer, S., Khazaei, S., Meier, W., Rechberger, C., New features of Latin dances: analysis of Salsa, ChaCha, and Rumba (2008) Fast Software Encryption, pp. 470-488. , Heidelberg: Springer; Fischer, S., Meier, W., Berbain, C., Biasse, J.F., Robshaw, M.J., Non-randomness in eSTREAM candidates Salsa20 and TSC-4 (2006) Progress in Cryptology-INDOCRYPT 2006, pp. 2-16. , Heidelberg: Springer; Stewart, I., Does God Play Dice?

However, there are several drawbacks to this approach, one of which is the risks resulted from the occurrence of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The goal of APT is to exfiltrate and leak important and sensitive corporate information through exploitation of vulnerabilities within BYOD environment. This paper addresses the APT issue via spear phishing attacks within BYOD environment, through the mediation provided by security policies. The devising of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security policies using ACPT includes the implementation of environment attributes along with the specification of proposed policy rules for organizations is proven to be the most suitable policy mechanism for BYOD environment.

The mobile device flexibility has encouraged users to turn their mobile devices into primary hubs for storing information. This paper adopts the classical CW-Lite security models as the framework and the human behavioral patterns as the context. The selected behavioral aspects refer to mobile application and mobility, deployed as major characteristics that determine security control decisions. This proposed paper requires the application of human behavioral context on mobile phones. The solution involves the novel use of behavioral aspects to improve the security of mobile phones. Two important scenarios are incorporated: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mobile application and AHP mobility. The proposed methodology is superior because it can detect the change in the user behavior in comparison with an intruder. The applied intelligent human behavioral context on the CW-Lite model shows the advantages of AHP in detecting the changes in the user behavior and in authenticating the identity of the main user. These advantages ensure reliability and security of the phone. © 2015 The Authors.",Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision making; CW-Lite security model; User authentication,Analytic hierarchy process; Authentication; Cellular telephones; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Information systems; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Social sciences; Telephone sets; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Behavioral patterns; Mobile app; Mobile applications; Security controls; Security model; User authentication; User behaviors; Behavioral research,,,,,,,,"Liu, Z., Hong, Y., Pi, D., A large-scale study of web password habits of chinese network users (2014) Journal of Software, 9 (2), pp. 293-297; Liu, T., Bahl, P., Chlamtac, I., Mobility modeling, location tracking, and trajectory prediction in wireless atm networks, Selected Areas in Communications (1998) IEEE Journal on, 16 (6), pp. 922-936; Bajaj, R., Ranaweera, S.L., Agrawal, D.P., Gps: Location-tracking technology (2002) Computer, 35 (4), pp. 92-94; Song, C., Qu, Z., Blumm, N., Barabási, A.-L., Limits of predictability in human mobility (2010) Science, 327 (5968), pp. 1018-1021; Phithakkitnukoon, S., Horanont, T., Di Lorenzo, G., Shibasaki, R., Ratti, C., Activity-aware map: Identifying human daily activity pattern using mobile phone data (2010) Human Behavior Understanding, Springer, pp. 14-25; Bigun, J., Fiérrez-Aguilar, J., Ortega-Garcia, J., Gonzalez-Rodriguez, J., Combining biometric evidence for person authentication (2005) Advanced Studies in Biometrics, Springer, pp. 1-18; Dinh, H.T., Lee, C., Niyato, D., Wang, P., A survey of mobile cloud computing: Architecture, applications, and approaches (2013) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 13 (18), pp. 1587-1611; Brosso, I., La Neve, A., (2012) Adaptive Security Policy Using User Behavior Analysis and Human Elements of Information Security, , INTECH Open Access Publisher; Barnes-Holmes, D., Barnes-Holmes, Y., Cullinan, V., Relational frame theory and skinner's verbal behavior: A possible synthesis (2000) The Behavior Analyst, 23 (1), p. 69; Shankar, U., Jaeger, T., Sailer, R., Toward automated information-flow integrity verification for security-critical applications (2006) NDSS; Muthukumaran, D., Schiffman, J., Hassan, M., Sawani, A., Rao, V., Jaeger, T., Protecting the integrity of trusted applications in mobile phone systems (2011) Security and Communication Networks, 4 (6), pp. 633-650; Saaty, T., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) for Decision Making, , Kobe, Japan; Jusoh, Y.Y., Chamili, K., Pa, N.C., Yahaya, J.H., Open source software selection using an analytical hierarchy process (ahp) (2014) American Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 3 (6), pp. 83-89; Sharma, M.J., Moon, I., Bae, H., Analytic hierarchy process to assess and optimize distribution network (2008) Applied Mathematics and Computation, 202 (1), pp. 256-265",,Bordea G.,"Intelligent Control Technology Association;Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (SIAT-CAS);The Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communications (SDIWC)",Elsevier,"3rd Information Systems International Conference, 2015",16 April 2015 through 18 April 2015,,123178,18770509,,,,English,Procedia Comput.

However, due to its portability and information available through social network, BYOD has become susceptible to information stealing attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT attack uses tricky methods in getting access into the target’s machine and mostly motives and stand as a threat to politics, corporate, academic and even military. Various mitigation techniques have been proposed in tackling this attack but, most of them are relying on available information of the attacks and does not provide data protection. Hence, it is challenging in providing protection against APT attack. In this paper, we will investigate on the available mitigation techniques and its problems in tackling APT attack by looking on the root cause of the attack inside BYOD environment. Lastly, based on the information obtained we will propose a new framework in reducing APT attack. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Access control; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model; Framework; MLS,Security of data; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Control framework; Framework; Mitigation techniques; MLS; Multi-level security; Threat mitigation; Access control,,,,,,,,"Fischer, N., Smolnik, S., The impact of mobile computing on individuals, organizations, and society - synthesis of existing literature and directions for future research (2013) IEEE 2013 46Th Hawaii International Conference System Sciences (HICSS), pp. 1082-1091; Dover, S., CBS News, Study: Number of Smartphone Users Tops 1 Billion, , http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57534583/; La Polla, M., Martinelli, F., Sgandurra, D., A Survey on Security for Mobile Devices (2013) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15 (1), pp. 446-471; Fossi, M., Egan, G.Y., Haley, K., Johnson, E., Mack, T., Adams, T., Blackbird, J., Wood, P., (2011) Symantec Internet Security Threat Report – Trends for 2010, 16. , Technical Report Volume, Symantec; Mobile Security Reference Architecture, Federal CIO Council and Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Program Directorate Office of Cybersecurity and Communications Federal Network Resilience (2013); Schmidt, A., Schmidt, H., Batyuk, L., Clausen, J.H., Camtepe, S.A., Albayrak, A., Smartphone malware evolution revisited: Android next target?

To date, there are various types of attendance systems that are applying different technologies such as biometrics, tokens and sensors such as RFID. The latest is by applying near-field communication (NFC), a sensor within the smartphone has been used as a mean for recording attendances. The aim of this paper is to list out the possible security attacks against NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled systems by focusing on a student-based attendance system. A brief overview over NFC technology and discussion on various security attacks against NFC in different media is presented. Overall, an attendance system is compromised mainly by tag swapping, tag cloning and manipulation of data occurring on the NFC device and operational server. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Attendance system; Mitigations; Near Field Communication (NFC); Security attack,Artificial intelligence; Mobile telecommunication systems; Students; Attendance systems; Mitigations; Nfc technologies; Security attacks; Security challenges; Student-based; Tag swapping; The near field communication (NFC); Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Özdenizci, B., Aydin, M., Coskun, V., Kerem, O.K., NFC Research Framework: A Literature Review and Future Research Directions, , Information Technologies Department, ISIK University, Istanbul; Madlmayr, G., Langer, J., Scharinger, J., Kantner, C., NFC Devices: Security and Privacy The Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security; Francis, L., Hancke, G., Mayes, K., Markantonakis, K., Practical NFC peer-to-peer relay attack using mobile phones (2010) Rfidsec 2010.

The implementation of ICT application can help to cope with this phenomenon and improve the quality of life of the elderly. This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis on the field of ageing and ICT to reveal the trend of research and technologies related in the recent years. Bibliometric information such as keywords and number of publication is extracted from the search result of online publication databases and then further analyzed using computational technique such as growth rate analysis and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to identify the relationship and the growth of the information extracted. The outcome is a set of terms that are grouped and ranked according to their relevance and growth in the recent year. This result can then provide a brief understanding on the trend of ageing and ICT for the researchers that wish to research on this field. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

Most of the current research on mobile organizers highlights that most users rely on the application as an effective tool to manage their daily activities especially among university students. A mobile organizer application is software that acts as a personal assistant for users to help them manage their time and activities. From a Malaysian context, the usage of these applications among university students has not been explored in-depth. The aim of this paper is to initially explore the current usage of mobile organizers within a Malaysian university specifically Universiti Sains Malaysia. There are a number of requirements that a mobile organizer application should fulfil, in order to be effective for users. In order to identify these requirements, an initial survey was conducted in order to identify these requirements, which, would then be incorporated into the development of a mobile organizer suitable for Malaysian university students. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Applications; Mobile organizers; Software,,,,,,,,,"Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013-2018 (2014), Cisco VNI Forecast, White paper edn.

However, even with the simplicity and security that the technology provide, the adoption of this technology is not widespread. In this paper, we describe the user-friendliness criteria essential for NFC technology through a proposed library system. To determine the criteria of user-friendliness for the technology, we conducted a survey on the understanding and usage of different users that would be exposed to a library system. The survey included questions about the existing library system (OPAC) and their perception of the NFC technology. Based on the results, we managed to identify that the OPAC system is not a userfriendly library system. Further, we have also identified that there are three main user-friendliness criteria deemed necessary by users for an NFC-enabled library system to be more effective than the OPAC system: usability, security and efficiency. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Near-field communication; OPAC system; Radio frequency identification (RFID),,,,,,,,,"Steffen, R., Preibinger, J., Schollermann, T., Muller, A., Schnabel, I., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an Automotive Environment: Use Cases, Architecture and Realization.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transmits the data without line of sight. RFID tags are small, wireless devices that help identify item automatically and indicating unique serial number for each item. However, counterfeiting in supply chain management likes cloned and fraud RFID tag bring the impact to the organization and social when attackers want to gain illegal benefits.Organizationsarelosing a lot of money and trust from userswhen counterfeiting occurred. Furthermore, RFID data nature characteristics faces the issues likes RFID just carry simple information, in-flood of data, inaccuracy data from RFID readers and difficulties to track spatial and place. We propose to use clustering algorithms in order to detect counterfeit in supply chain management. We will apply various clustering algorithms to analyzed and determine every attribute in the dataset structure pattern. Based on evaluation that have done, we found that Farthest First is the best algorithm for 1000 (small data) and 10000 (bigger data). However, the values of false negative in data still quite high and it is dangerous if RFID scanner misread the cloned or fraud tags become genuine tags. Hence, we applied cost algorithms to reduce false negative values.",Clustering algorithms; Counterfeiting; Radio Frequency Identification (RFID); Supply Chain Management (SCM); Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA),Algorithms; Chains; Cloning; Crime; Electromagnetic waves; Information management; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio waves; Supply chain management; Counterfeiting; False negatives; Knowledge analysis; Radio frequencies; RFID-enabled supply chains; Simple informations; Supply chain managements (SCM); Wireless devices; Clustering algorithms,,,,,,,,"Mahinderjit-Singh, M., Li, X., Li, Z., A cost-based model for risk management in rfid-enabled supply chain applications (2011) Supply Chain Management, pp. 201-236; Singh, M.M., Li, X., Li, Z., Security and privacy protection in RFID-enabled supply chain management (2011) International Journal of Radio Frequency Identification Technology and Applications, 3-4, pp. 294-318; Mahinderjit-Singh, M., Li, X., Trust in RFID-enabled supply-chain management (2010) International Journal of Security and Networks, 5 (2), pp. 96-105; Derakhshan, R., Orlowska, M.E., Li, X., (2007) RFID Data Management: Challenges and Opportunities, , Citeseer, City; Gao, X., Xiang, Z., Wang, H., Shen, J., Huang, J., Song, S., (2004) An Approach to Security and Privacy of RFID System for Supply Chain, , IEEE, City; Chao, C.-C., Yang, J.-M., Jen, W.-Y., Determining technology trends and forecasts of RFID by a historical review and bibliometric analysis from 1991 to 2005 (2007) Technovation, 27 (5), pp. 268-279; Mehrjerdi, Y.Z., RFID-enabled supply chain systems with computer simulation (2009) Assembly Automation, 29 (2), pp. 174-183; Michael, K., McCathie, L., (2005) The Pros and Cons of RFID in Supply Chain Management, , IEEE, City; Han, J., Gonzalez, H., Li, X., Klabjan, D., (2006) Warehousing and Mining Massive RFID Data Sets, , Springer, City; Mirowski, L., Hartnett, J., Deckard: A system to detect change of RFID tag ownership (2007) International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 7 (7), pp. 89-98; Lehtonen, M., Michahelles, F., Fleisch, E., (2007) Probabilistic Approach for Location-based Authentication, , City; Bagirov, A., Rubinov, A., Soukhoroukova, N., Yearwood, J., Unsupervised and supervised data classification via nonsmooth and global optimization (2003) Top, 11 (1), pp. 1-75; Singh, M.M., Teen, L.M., (2014) RFID-enabled Supply Chain Simulator for Counterfeiting Attack Detection; Sikander, J., (2007) RFID Enabled Retail Supply Chain, , Retrieved March; Moon, T.K., The expectation-maximization algorithm.

The drawback of this conventional method is the loss of time in jotting down the attendance, leading to human error and cheating issues and the inability of capturing and storing the attendance record for other essential university activities. In this project, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-enabled Smart Attendance Management System (RFID-SAMS) will be designed to cater to the limitation of the conventional attendance system. The RFIDSAMS system function to enrolled students and staff data and course related information, record and monitor students’ attendance and their movement during any courses attended. Its ability to uniquely identify each person based on their RFID tag type of ID card make the process of taking the attendance easier, faster and secure as compared to conventional method. The uniqueness of RFID-SAMS is the capability to detect any duplication RFID event readings and miss readings. In addition, this system has been enhanced to cater the latest ubiquitous technology such as the mobile devices, which are Window Phone and Windows Surface RT. The overall system provides an efficient, accurate and portability solution and work well for the real-life attendance environment within the university. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",Attendance system; RFID; Smartphone; Tablet; Web page; Windows phone; Windows surface,Education; Mobile devices; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Students; Telephone sets; Websites; Attendance management systems; Attendance records; Attendance systems; Conventional methods; System functions; Tablet; Ubiquitous technology; Windows phones; Cellular telephone systems,,,,,,,,"Abd Wahab, M.H., Abdul Kadir, H., Mohd Yusof, M.N., Sanudin, R., Tomari, M.R., Class attendance system using active RFID: A review (2009) Compilation of Papers, 2, pp. 9-21; Arulogun, O.T., Olatunbosun, A., Fakolujo, O.A., Olaniyi, O.M., RFID-based students attendance management system (2013) Int J Sci Eng Res 4(2):1-9.

Decrement in security within clouds contributes to a loss of clients-confidence, lack of control and loss of trustworthiness in cloud service providers. Loss of control occurs when clients lose their control over their own resources in the hand of service provider. As lack of authentication and access control placed by providers, loss of control contributes to greater security concern. In this research, a novel trust framework is proposed which focus on tackling the loss of central concern by granting back control to the cloud clients in ensuring their service provider environments fully secure and trustworthy. Secondly, the trust model also functions in ensuring that both client and service providers transaction follows set of security mechanism in place. The results proved that both trust need to be enforced is any cloud. Thus the proposed trust model contributes as a mean to solve the security challenges known as loss of control. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Access control; Authentication; Cloud computing; Loss of Control; Trust,Access control; Authentication; Computer science; Network security; Cloud service providers; Loss of control; Security and privacy; Security challenges; Security mechanism; Service provider; Trust; Trust frameworks; Cloud computing,,,,,,,,"Dillon, T., Cloud computing issues and challenges (2010) 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, Perth, WA; Wang, Z., Security and privacy issues within the cloud computing (2011) International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences, Chengdu, China; Lar, S.-U., Cloud computing privacy &Security global issues, challenges, &Mechanisms (2011) 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM 2011), Harbin; Ko, R.K.L., TrustCloud a framework for accountability and trust in cloud computing (2011) World Congress on Services 2011, pp. 584-588. , Washington, DC; Winkler, V., Data Security in Cloud Computing-Part 3: Cloud Data Protection Methods, , http://www.eetimes.com/design/embedded-internet-design/4218591/ Data-security-in-cloud-computing-Part-3-Cloud-dataprotection-methods?pageNumber= 0, (accessed August 8, 2011); http://clean-clouds.com/2012/04/25/federated-identity-management-in- cloud-computing-2/, Re-Searcher.

Available literature suggests that bridging these high risk patients with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (g2b3a) inhibitors could be efficacious in preventing stent thrombosis (Ben Morrison et al., Catheter Cardiovasc Interv 2012;79;575-582). However, this still remains to be proven in larger prospective studies.

RFID supply chain performance can be enhanced by integrating RFID functions into the web service paradigm. However, the use of RFID involves growing privacy and security concerns, in part because the lack of RFID tag capacity places the whole supply-chain loop at risk of security such as product counterfeiting. In this paper, we tackle the security and privacy challenges in RFID by using context-aware web service technology. By employing a seven-layer trust framework, we design the functionalities to comply with web service architecture. In order to address the security and privacy problems, we also use the context parameters such as location and time to model the situations of RFID tags. A complete case of RFID-enabled supply chain in an EPCglobal network using context-aware web services is provided to tackle the RFID security and privacy challenges.

This supply-chain environment can only be effective if the partners can trust each other and be collaborative. However, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) involves growing privacy and security concerns in part because humans cannot sense the radio frequency radiation used to read tags and the tags themselves maintain no history of past readings. Counterfeiting in the form of cloned or fraudulent RFID tags is a consequence of a lack of security measures and trust among the partners when RFID technology is used to automate their business transactions. This paper discusses the ways in which privacy and security protection can be maintained in an open-loop RFID supply chain. A cost-based detection of counterfeit tags using different classifiers is presented. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Cloning; Privacy; SCM; Security; Supply chain management,Clone cells; Cloning; Data privacy; Radio waves; Supply chain management; Business transaction; Privacy and security; Radio frequency radiation; RFID-enabled supply chains; Security; Security and privacy protection; Supply chain systems; System environment; Radio frequency identification (RFID),,,,,,,,"Ayoade, J., Roadmap to solving security and privacy concerns in RFID systems (2007) Computer Law and Security Report, 23 (6), pp. 555-561. , DOI 10.1016/j.clsr.2007.09.005, PII S026736490700091X; Choi, S.H., Poon, C.H., An RFID-based anti-counterfeiting system, IAENG (2008) International Journal of Computer Science (IJCS), 35 (1), pp. 1-12; Devadas, S., Suh, E., Paral, S., Sowell, R., Ziola, T., Khandelwal, V., Design and implementation of PUF based ""Unclonable"" RFID ICs for anti-counterfeiting and security applications (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE International Conference on RFID, pp. 58-64; Domingos, P., MetaCost: A general method for making classifiers cost-sensitive (1999) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 155-164. , ACM Press, New York; Drummond, C., Holte, R., Exploiting the cost (in)sensitivity of decision tree splitting criteria (2000) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 239-246; Gao, X., Xiang, Z., Wang, H., Shen, J., Huang, J., Song, S., An approach to security and privacy of RFID system for supply chain (2004) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology for Dynamic E-Business, CEC-East 2004, pp. 164-168. , Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology for Dynamic E-Business, CEC-East 2004; Garfinkel, S.L., Juels, A., Pappu, R., RFID privacy: An overview of problems and proposed solutions (2005) IEEE Security and Privacy, 3 (3), pp. 34-43. , DOI 10.1109/MSP.2005.78; Hargraves, K., Shafer, S., (2004) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Privacy: The Microsoft Perspective, , http://www.microsoft.com/twc; Henrici, D., Muller, P., Hash-based enhancement of location privacy for radiofrequency identification devices using varying identifiers (2004) International Workshop on Pervasive Computing and Communication Security - PerSec, pp. 149-153. , Sandhu, R. and Thomas, R.

Open RFID systems can only be effective if the systems can trust each other and be collaborative. The open system environment is also constantly evolving. So the trust and the collaborations need to be constantly maintained to cope with changes. RFID is becoming a ubiquitous computing technology imposing security and privacy threats. Counterfeiting in supply chain management is an attack with cloned andfraud RFID tags in order to gain illegal benefits. In this paper we will extend our previous work on a trust framework and construct a computational model for the trust management. The trust evaluation is built into the process of transactions of the data exchange and authorization in order to facilitate a better data sharing and access control. An example of wine counterfeiting will be presented and we will show how our computational trust model helps in reducingfraud brand of wines in supply chain management (SCM). ©2009 IEEE.",Computational Trust Management (CTM); RFID; Supply Chain Management (SCM); Trust Management (TM),Business workflows; Computational model; Computational trust; Computational trust model; Data exchange; Data Sharing; RF-ID tags; RFID systems; Security and privacy; Trust evaluation; Trust frameworks; Trust management; Ubiquitous computing technology; Access control; Logistics; Open systems; Radio navigation; Sensors; Supply chains; Ubiquitous computing; Wine; Wireless networks; Supply chain management,,,,,,,,"Z.
