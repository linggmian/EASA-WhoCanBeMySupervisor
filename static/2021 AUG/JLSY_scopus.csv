We experimented with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn sentiment polarity (positive or negative) from labeled data available in many different source domains and test its performance on a target domain that it is not trained on. Extensive experiments were conducted on 14 different domains using Amazon product reviews. Our preliminary findings show that cross-domain CNN models trained with multiple source domains achieved accuracy of above 80% across all the domains and outperform the in-domain models trained using limited labeled data from the same domain. In fact, the cross-domain CNN models demonstrated better performance when a larger number of source domains are used for training. Therefore, going deep and big is a promising direction to explore for cross-domain sentiment classification. © 2020 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; cross-domain sentiment classification; deep learning; product reviews; sentiment analysis","Convolution; Labeled data; Sentiment analysis; Different domains; Multiple domains; Multiple source; Number of sources; Product reviews; Sentiment classification; Target domain; Training data; Convolutional neural networks",,,,,"203/PKOMP/67711796

While distant supervision provides a viable alternative, the self-labeled emotion corpus is susceptible to a high level of noise. This paper introduces a text augmentation method that can be used to efficiently expand the size of positive examples for the purpose of training by harnessing tweets collected from distant supervision (DS) that are similar to a small set of gold standard seed tweets. Tweets labeled with happiness in EmoTweet-28 (ET) are used as gold standard seeds to augment the training data to include similar DS tweets containing the happiness hashtags. Three pre-trained sentence encoders are used to encode the tweets into multidimensional vectors for similarity scoring between each DS:ET-seed pair. DS tweets with similarity scores exceeding a predefined threshold are added into an augmented set that is subsequently used to train a linear SVM classifier to distinguish between happiness and non-happiness. Our proposed text augmentation method proved to be a more effective approach that can leverage quality training data in larger quantities contributed by both carefully curated and distant supervision emotion corpora. © 2020 IEEE.","distant supervision; emotion classification; machine learning; microblog; sentence embeddings; similarity measures; text augmentation","Support vector machines; Text processing; Augmentation methods; Effective approaches; Emotion classification; Machine learning models; Multi-dimensional vectors; Positive examples; Similarity measure; Similarity scores; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315171","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315171).

This paper introduces an alternative approach in applying machine learning to block cipher cryptanalysis. Rather than trying to extract secret keys, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict a cipher's security margin with respect to the number of active s-boxes. Prediction is based on cipher features such as the number of rounds, permutation pattern, and truncated differences. Experiments are performed on a simplified generalised Feistel structure (GFS) block cipher. Prediction accuracy is optimised by refining how cipher features are represented as training data, and tuning hyperparameters. Results show that the machine learning classifiers are able formulate a relationship between the cipher features and security. When used to predict an unseen cipher (a cipher whose data was not used for training), an accuracy of up to 62% was obtained, depicting the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 ACM.","Active s-box; Block cipher; Differential cryptanalysis; Linear classifier; Machine learning; Security","Forecasting; Machine learning; Security of data; Turing machines; Block ciphers; Feistel structures; Hyperparameters; Machine learning approaches; Permutation patterns; Prediction accuracy; Security margins; Training data; Cryptography",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1 and by the Uniten BOLD research grant under Grant No. 10463494/B/2019117.","Alallayah, K., Amin, M., AbdElwahed, W., Alhamamii, A., Applying neural networks for simplified data encryption standard (SDES) cipher system cryptanalysis (2012) The International Arab Journal of Information Technology, pp. 163-169. , Zarqa University, Jordan; Alani, M.M., Neuro-cryptanalysis of DES and triple-DES (2012) Neural Information Processing, pp. 637-646. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Albassal, A., Wahdan, A.-M., Neural network based cryptanalysis of a feistel type block cipher (2004) International Conference on Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, 2004.

Using four different sampling strategies (random sampling, sampling by topic and two variations of sampling by user), we found the class distribution of28 emotion categories to differ across the samples produced by each sampling strategy. However, combining different sampling strategies is complementary in generating sufficiently diverse training examples for the emotion classifiers. Based on support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian network learning algorithms, our findings show that a classifier trained on combined data from the four sampling strategies performs better and is more generalizable than a classifier trained only on data from a single sampling strategy. Demonstrating how the diversity of the training samples affect the performance of emotion classifiers is the main contribution of this study. © 2019 IEEE.","Fine-grained emotion classification; Machine learning; Microblog text; Sample diversity; Sampling strategies","Bayesian networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sampling; Support vector machines; Text processing; Bayesian network learning; Class distributions; Emotion classification; Micro-blog; Random sampling; Sampling strategies; Training example; Training sample; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6315171","This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315171).

The corpus contains annotations for four facets of emotion: valence, arousal, emotion category and emotion cues. We first used small-scale content analysis to inductively identify a set of emotion categories that characterize the emotions expressed in microblog text. We then expanded the size of the corpus using crowdsourcing. The corpus encompasses a variety of examples including explicit and implicit expressions of emotions as well as tweets containing multiple emotions.

This paper first presents a set of 48 emotion categories discovered inductively from 5,553 annotated tweets through a small-scale content analysis by trained or expert annotators. We then refine the emotion categories to a set of 28 and test how representative they are on a larger set of 10,000 tweets through crowdsourcing. We describe the two-phase methodology used to expose and refine the set of fine-grained emotion categories from tweets, compare the inter-annotator agreement between annotations generated by expert and novice annotators (crowdsourcing) and show that it is feasible to perform fine-grained emotion classification using gold standard data generated from these two phases. Our main goal is to offer a more representative and finer-grained framework of emotions expressed in microblog text, thus allowing study of emotions that are currently underexplored in sentiment analysis. © 2016 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.",,"Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Social networking (online); Content analysis; Emotion classification; Expert and novices; Fine grained; Gold standards; Micro-blog; Sentiment analysis; Small scale; Data mining",,,,,,,"Abelson, R., Sermat, V., Multidimensional scaling of facial expressions (1962) Journal of Experimental Psychology, 63 (6), pp. 546-554. , [Abelson and Sermat, 1962]; Alm, C., Roth, D., Sproat, R., Emotions from text: Machine learning for text-based emotion prediction (2005) Proceedings of the Conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 579-586. , [Alm et al., 2005], Stroudsburg, PA, USA; Aman, S., Szpakowicz, S., Identifying expressions of emotion in text (2007) Text, Speech and Dialogue, pp. 196-205. , [Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007]; Averill, J.R., A constructivist view of emotion (1980) Emotion: Theory, Research, and Experience, 1, pp. 305-339. , [Averill, 1980] Academic Press, New York; Besnier, N., Language and affect (1990) Annual Review of Anthropology, 19, pp. 419-451. , [Besnier, 1990]; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8. , [Bollen et al., 2011a]; Bollen, J., Pepe, A., Mao, H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena (2011) Proceedings of the 5th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 450-453. , [Bollen et al., 2011b]; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Measuring emotion: The self-Assessment manikin and the semantic differential (1994) Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 25 (1), pp. 49-59. , [Bradley et al., 1994]; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., (1999) Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW): Instruction Manual and Affective Ratings, , [Bradley and Lang, 1999].

Although there are various conceptualizations of the IField, to date, in-depth studies based on empirical evidence are scarce. This article reports a study that fills this gap. We focus on the first five ISchools in the ICaucus as a proxy to represent the IField. The intellectual characteristics are depicted by two independent sets of data on tenure track faculty as knowledge contributors: their intellectual heritages and the intellectual substance in their journal publications. We use a critical analysis method to examine doctoral training areas and 3 years of journal publications. Our results indicate that (a) the IField can be better conceptualized with empirical support by a four-component model that includes People, Information, Technology, and Management, as predicted by the I-Model (Zhang & Benjamin, 2007); (b) the ISchools' faculty members are diverse, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary as shown by their intellectual heritages, by their research foci, by journals in which they publish, by the contexts within which they conduct research, and by the levels of analysis in research investigations; (c) the five ISchools share similarities while evincing differences in both faculty heritages and intellectual substances; (d) ISchool tenure track faculty members do not collaborate much with each other within or across schools although there is great potential; and (e) intellectual heritages are not good predictors of scholars' intellectual substance. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings on IField identity, IField development, new ISchool formation and existing ISchool evolution, faculty career development, and collaboration within the IField. © 2013 ASIS&T.",,"Career development; Critical analysis; Education and researches; Faculty members; In-depth study; Independent set; Journal publication; Levels of analysis; Employment; Research; Teaching",,,,,,,"Babbie, E.R., (2010) The Practice of Social Research, , (12th ed.).

Klout, a company that measures influence on the social web, recently ranked Syracuse University (SU) as the No. 2 ""Most Influential College on Twitter"". While at first glance, Klout's ranking presents a flattering portrayal of SU's adept use of social media, we question if the Klout score has real substance, and actually reflects the effectiveness of SU's social media strategy. This paper explores the issue of how one assigns value to a tweet in the context of an academic institution from a survey of SU students on their motivation of Twitter use, behavior, and perception of value associated with a tweet. As users primarily read tweets to obtain interesting information, preliminary findings indicate that users in academic institutions are more concerned with the quality of tweet contents as opposed to how influential the institution is on Twittersphere. © 2012 Authors.","measurement; social media; Tweet; twitter; value","Academic institutions; Appropriate metrics; Interesting information; Social media; Syracuse University; Tweet; twitter; value; Industry; Measurements; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,"(2011) Klout: The Standard for Influence, , http://klout.com/, Retrieved from; Morrow, K., (2011) Syracuse University Is Second Most Influential College on Twitter, , http://insidesu.syr.edu/2011/01/18/klout/, Retrieved from; Hoffman, D.L., Fodor, M., Can You Measure the ROI of Your Social Media Marketing?

Developed using a combination of image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, CDES possesses the capability to count the number of people in moderately high crowds from a flexibly selected region of interest (ROI). Background removal and edge detection are first applied to the image for crowd feature extraction. Then, the extracted crowd foreground blob pixels are scaled accordingly to correct perspective distortion. Finally, the corrected pixel blobs act as input for the backpropagation (BP) neural network to estimate the number of people within the blob. Using the area of the selected ROI, the crowd density is calculated and classified into five ranges from very low to very high. The experimental results are presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","BP neural network; Crowd density estimation; Hajj; Masjid al-Haram; People counting; Perspective distortion correction; Pixel-based feature extraction","BP neural networks; Crowd density estimation; Hajj; Masjid al-Haram; People counting; Perspective distortion correction; Aluminum; Edge detection; Estimation; Feature extraction; Image processing; Pixels; Neural networks; accuracy; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; back propagation; computer analysis; crowd density estimation system; digital imaging; image processing; priority journal",,,,,"University of Southern Maine, USM

The socially-interactive dressing room allows shoppers to talk to their friends in real time for opinions on their garment purchasing decisions. Our work is motivated by the observation that shoppers who lack fashion sense often rely on their friends' opinions when making garment purchasing decisions. Using the iterative user interface design methodology, we conducted a mini focus group and interviews among male and female shoppers to refine the user interface design. Our findings suggest that an iterative approach proves to be useful in uncovering and addressing usability, aesthetics, and trust issues that arise from incorporating a socially interactive system within a dressing room context.","Formative evaluation; Interactive user interface; Iterative design; Shopping behavior; Social network; Socially-interactive dressing room","Formative evaluation; Interactive user interface; Iterative design; Shopping behavior; Social Networks; Socially-interactive dressing room; Design; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; User interfaces",,,,,,,"Annett, J., Duncan, K.D., Task analysis and training design (1967) Occupational Psychology, 41, pp. 211-221; Koolhaas, R., Bertelli, P., Hommert, J., Kubo, M., Prada, M., (2002) Projects for Prada: Part 1, , Fondazione Prada; Nanda, S., (2007) Virtual Mirrors, , Reuters; Nielsen, J., Iterative user-interface design (2002) Computer, 26 (11), pp. 32-4. , Nolan, K.
