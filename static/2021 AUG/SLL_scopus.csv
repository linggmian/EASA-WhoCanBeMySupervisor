In times of pandemics such as COVID-19, vulnerable people need help to survive. This help includes the distribution of relief packages and materials by the government with the primary objective of lessening the economic and psychological effects on the citizens affected by disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has not been an efficient way to monitor public funds’ accountability and transparency, especially in developing countries such as Nigeria. The understanding of public emotions by the government on distributed palliatives is important as it would indicate the reach and impact of the distribution exercise. Although several studies on English emotion classification have been conducted, these studies are not portable to a wider inclusive Nigerian case. This is because Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin), which Nigerians widely speak, has quite a different vocabulary from Standard English, thus limiting the applicability of the emotion classification of Standard English machine learning models. An Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin English) emotions dataset is constructed, pre-processed, and annotated. The dataset is then used to classify five emotion classes (anger, sadness, joy, fear, and disgust) on the COVID-19 palliatives and relief aid distribution in Nigeria using standard machine learning (ML) algorithms. Six ML algorithms are used in this study, and a comparative analysis of their performance is conducted. The algorithms are Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistics Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). The conducted experiments reveal that Support Vector Machine outperforms the remaining classifiers with the highest accuracy of 88%. The “disgust” emotion class surpassed other emotion classes, i.e., sadness, joy, fear, and anger, with the highest number of counts from the classification conducted on the constructed dataset. Additionally, the conducted correlation analysis shows a significant relationship between the emotion classes of “Joy” and “Fear”, which implies that the public is excited about the palliatives’ distribution but afraid of inequality and transparency in the distribution process due to reasons such as corruption. Conclusively, the results from this experiment clearly show that the public emotions on COVID-19 support and relief aid packages’ distribution in Nigeria were not satisfactory, considering that the negative emotions from the public outnumbered the public happiness. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, studies have increasingly used the thermal imaging as a potential and supplemental solution to overcome the challenges of visual (RGB) imaging, such as the variation of light conditions and revealing original human affect. Moreover, the thermal-based imaging has shown promising results in the detection of psychophysiological signals, such as pulse rate and respiration rate in a contactless and noninvasive way. This paper presents a brief review on human affects and focuses on the advantages and challenges of the thermal imaging technique. In addition, this paper discusses the stages of thermal-based human affective state recognition, such as dataset type, preprocessing stage, region of interest (ROI), feature descriptors, and classification approaches with a brief performance analysis based on a number of works in the literature. This analysis could help beginners in the thermal imaging and affective recognition domain to explore numerous approaches used by researchers to construct an affective state system based on thermal imaging. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

Trustworthiness is measured via the effectiveness of the relationships involving human perception. The decision to trust others is often made quickly (even at zero acquaintance). Previous research has shown the significance of voice in perceived trustworthiness. However, the listeners' characteristics were not considered. A system has yet to be produced that can quantitatively predict the degree of trustworthiness in a voice. This research aims to investigate the relationship between trustworthiness and different vocal features while considering the listener's physical characteristics, towards modelling a computational trust model. This study attempts to predict the degree of trustworthiness in voice by using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. A set of 30 audio clips of white males were obtained, acoustically analyzed and then distributed to a large group of untrained Malaysian respondents who rated their degree of trust in the speakers of each audio clip on a scale of 0 to 10. The ANOVA test showed a statistically significant difference of trust ratings across different types and intensities of emotion, duration of audio clip, average fundamental frequencies, speech rates, articulation rates, average loudness, ethnicity of listener and ages of listener (p <.01). The findings conclude that Malaysians tend to trust white males who talk faster and longer, speak louder, have an f0 between 132.03Hz & 149.52Hz, and show a neutral emotion or rather stoic (arousal<.325). Results suggest that Indians are the most trusting Malaysian ethnic group, followed by Bumiputera from East Malaysia and then followed by Malays. Chinese are the least trusting Malaysian ethnic group. The data was fed into an ANN model to be evaluated, which yielded a perfect percentage accuracy (100%) in degree of trustworthiness 39.70% of the time. Given a threshold of two-point deviation, the ANN had a prediction accuracy of 76.86%. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The three most important challenges are facial occlusion, the problem of dealing with a single sample per subject (SSPS) and facial expression. This paper describes and analyzes various strategies that have been developed recently for overcoming these three major challenges that seriously affect the performance of real face recognition systems. This survey is organized in three parts. In the first part, approaches to tackle the challenge of facial occlusion are classified, illustrated and compared. The second part briefly describes the SSPS problem and the associated solutions. In the third part, facial expression challenge is illustrated. In addition, pros and cons of each technique are stated. Finally, several improvements for future research are suggested, providing a useful perspective for addressing new research in face recognition. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Expression; Face recognition; Facial occlusion challenge; Single sample per subject (SSPS) problem,Surveys; Expression; Face recognition systems; Facial Expressions; Facial occlusions; Real applications; Single sample; Unconstrained environments; Face recognition,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6312153,Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the funding of this work from the Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6312153.

Recently, large efforts have been devoted to devise objective QoE metrics that correlate with perceived subjective measurements. Despite recent progress, limited success has been attained. In this paper, we provide some insights on why QoE assessment is so difficult by presenting few major issues as well as a general summary of quality/QoE formation and conception including human auditory and vision systems. Also, potential future research directions are described to discern the path forward. This is an academic and perspective article, which is hoped to complement existing studies and prompt interdisciplinary research. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group.

In this study, a cross-cultural perception experiment of Spanish Synthetic Expressive Voices (SEV) was conducted to investigate the perception rate among different groups of Asians towards the SEV. Ten (10) subjects from each ethnic group namely Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysians participated in this test. The subjects were required to listen to and categorize the SEV corpus which contains 260 utterances with 4 emotions (anger, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and the neutral speech in different intensities and durations. Overall, the results indicate that duration and intensity of speech plays a significant role in perception. This paper concludes that listeners' perceptions are influenced by a speaker's nonverbal expression and it is important that these features (duration and intensity of speech) are considered when modelling synthetic speech for artificial agents in real-time applications in a cross-cultural user environment. © 2018 by the authors.",Artificial agents; Cross-cultural effects; Nonverbal; Perception; Prosody; Spanish,,,,,,"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST

Telecomunicación (ETSIT) Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain","In this paper, we propose a memetic based framework called Optimized Symmetric Partial Facegraphs (OSPF) to recognize faces prone to adverse conditions such as facial occlusions, expression and illumination variations. Faces are initially segmented into facial components and optimal landmarks are automatically generated by exploiting the bilateral symmetrical property of human faces. The proposed approach combines an improved harmony search algorithm and an intelligent single particle optimizer to take advantage of their global and local search capabilities. Basically, the hybridization version aids to compute the optimal landmarks. These landmarks further serve as the building blocks to intuitively construct the partial facegraphs. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been investigated in addressing the facial occlusion problem when only one exemplar face image per subject is available using comprehensive experimental validations. The proposed approach yields improved recognition rates when compared to recent state-of-the-art techniques. © 2017",Face recognition; Facial occlusion; Harmony search algorithm; Intelligent single particle optimizer; Symmetric partial facegraphs,Learning algorithms; Optimization; Automatically generated; Experimental validations; Facial occlusions; Harmony search algorithms; Illumination variation; Improved harmony search algorithms; Intelligent single particle optimizer; Symmetric partial facegraphs; Face recognition,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/ 6312153,The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the partial funding of this work from the grant no. 304/PKOMP/ 6312153 .,,"Abual-Rub, M.S., Al-Betar, M.A., Abdullah, R., Khader, A.T., A hybrid harmony search algorithm for ab initio protein tertiary structure prediction (2012) Netw.

The linguistic were obtained from 160 Malaysian Facebook users with an extracted textual data derived from 12573 wall-posted statuses. The jury method is used to assign each word to its correct category by comparing the direct translation of the word in Malay versus the English word in the English psychometric dictionary. LIWC classifies words by categories thus assigning the correct ones to the most precise translations and usage are essential. The work successfully categorized 2820 Malay words from the Malaysian Facebook statuses. This methodological note declares the creation of the Malay language version of the LIWC and the exemplary application of the dictionary in classifying personality of extraversion of the Malaysian Facebook users. The constructed Malay LIWC dictionary can be applied to any natural language processing framework or machine learning area that focuses on mining the Malay text language. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

Users freely share their public information on social media. Apart from that, their usage behaviour also provide a rich source of data for prediction. Automatic prediction of personality trait is vital to improve the user experience and to tailor social media services to users’ needs and preferences. The study in APP based on social media data has thus far focused on Western countries such as the United States and Europe and there is little to no work done in South East Asia, much less in Malaysia. Hence, this paper aims to predict user traits based on social media by gathering certain information pertaining social network usage behaviour based on features such as likes, number of comments, number of friends, etc. A person’s personality is described by the characteristics of extraversion and neuroticism main features that can be seen as an echo of communications behaviour. Personality traits of extraversion, neuroticism and shyness will be the focus, as Malaysians are known to be shy and passive. Therefore, the above mentioned features will not only be explored in a more detailed scope, but also focused on other factors or behaviours that constitute shyness. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

This approach includes two variability compensation strategies (Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) and Probabilistic LDA) for dealing with the gait variability due to different recording sessions or different activities carried out by the user. This study uses a public available dataset that includes recordings from 30 users performing three different activities: walking, walking-upstairs and walking-downstairs. The i-vector approach is compared to a Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) system, providing significant performance improvements when incorporating the PLDA compensation strategy: the best result reports a User Recognition Error Rate (URER) of 17.7%, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 6.1% and an F1-score of 82.7% with 30 enrolled users. For less than six enrolled users, the URER error decreases to 5%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Gait recognition; I-vector analysis; Person identification; PLDA compensation; Smartphone inertial signals,Gaussian distribution; Object recognition; Smartphones; Speech recognition; Vectors; Compensation strategy; Gait recognition; Gaussian mixture model-universal background models; I vectors; Linear discrimination analysis; Performance improvements; Person identification; Variability compensation; Error compensation,,,,,"TIN2014-54288-C4-1-R

Although FACS has been used to categorize facial uncertainty, very few studies have worked in this field. Most studies rather focus on uncertainty detection using voice, even though uncertainty is more apparent through facial cues compared to vocal cues, and this warrants for the collection and analysis of a facial corpus. Hence, an effort to collect a facial corpus of uncertainty were made and the corpus is then analyzed. Data was collected through an experiment that entailed using stimuli to induce the uncertainty of the subject. The data was annotated in order to verify the images before proceeding to preprocessing and feature extraction techniques. The feature extraction of the images was carried out using Gabor Wavelets and classification to train the data is used Support Vector Machine (SVM). © 2016 IEEE.",emotion detection; facial action coding system (FACS); Gabor wavelets; image processing; support vector machine (SVM); uncertainty,Extraction; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Gabor filters; Image coding; Image processing; Signal encoding; Support vector machines; Uncertainty analysis; Emotion detection; Facial Action Coding System; Facial Expressions; Feature extraction techniques; Gabor wavelets; Learning context; uncertainty; Computer keyboards,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6312153,The authors thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the funding of this work from the grant no. 304/PKOMP/6312153.,,"(2015), http//www.gartner.com/it-glossary/emotion-detection, Gartner.com,www.gartner.com,[Accessed 30th September 2015]; Lutfi, S.L., Fernández-Martínez, F., Lucas-Cuesta, J.M., Lopez-Lebon, L., Montero, J.M., A satisfaction-based model for affect recognition from conversational features in spoken dialog systems (2013) Speech Communication, 55 (7), pp. 825-840; Forbes-Riley, K., Litman, D., Rotaru, M., Responding to student uncertainty during computer tutoring: An experimental evaluation (2008) International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 60-69. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Baker, R.S., D'Mello, S.K., Rodrigo, M.M.T., Graesser, A.C., Better to be frustrated than bored: The incidence, persistence, and impact of learners' cognitive-affective states during interactions with three different computer-based learning environments (2010) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 68 (4), pp. 223-241; Forbes-Riley, K., Litman, D., Benefits and challenges of real-time uncertainty detection and adaptation in a spoken dialogue computer tutor (2011) Speech Communication, 53 (9), pp. 1115-1136; Mokhtar, N.S., Lutfi, S.L., Identifying significant predictors of emotion in learning (2015) International Workshop on Empathetic Computing, PRIMA 2015, , Bertirono, Italy; Bettadapura, V., (2012) Face Expression Recognition and Analysis: State of the Art, pp. 1203-6722. , http//arxiv.org, ArXiv e-print archive, Cornell University Library; Ekman, P., Friesen, W.V., Measuring facial movement (1976) Environmental Psychology and Nonverbal Behavior, 1 (1), pp. 56-75; Abdullah, A.A., Automatic and person-independent detection of 3d facial expressions using enhanced support vector machine with probability estimation (2015) IEEE Digital Library; Song, K.T., Chien, S.C., Facial expression recognition based on mixture of basic expressions and intensities (2012) IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics; Su, M.C., Hsieh, Y., Huang, D.Y., A simple approach to facial expression recognition (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 WSEAS International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications, 456-461; Schrank, T., Schuppler, B., Automatic detection of uncertainty in spontaneous German dialogue (2015) Sixteenth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association; Sebe, N., Lew, M.S., Sun, Y., Cohen, I., Gevers, T., Huang, T.S., Authentic facial expression analysis (2007) Image and Vision Computing, 25, pp. 1856-1863; Kotsia, I., Pitas, I., Facial expression recognition in image sequences using geometric deformation features and support vector machines (2007) IEEE Trans.

In the proposed HSO-EBGM, a recent evolutionary approach called harmony search optimization is tailored to automatically determine optimal facial landmarks. A novel notion of face subgraphs have been formulated with the aid of these automated landmarks that maximizes the similarity entailed by the subgraphs. For experimental evaluation, two sets of de facto databases (i.e., AR and Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) ver2.0) are used to validate and analyze the behavior of the proposed HSO-EBGM in terms of number of subgraphs, varying occlusion sizes, face images under controlled/ideal conditions, realistic partial occlusions, expression variations and varying illumination conditions. For a number of experiments, results justify that the HSO-EBGM shows improved recognition performance when compared to recent state-of-the-art face recognition approaches. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Face recognition; Graphical model; Harmony search; Occlusion; Optimization,Computer graphics; Graphic methods; Optimization; Elastic bunch graph matching; Experimental evaluation; Face recognition grand challenges; GraphicaL model; Harmony search; Harmony search optimizations; Illumination conditions; Occlusion; Face recognition,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,This research is supported by the RUI Grant: RUI#1001/pkomp/811290 awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia.,,"Abdullah, M.F.A., Sayeed, M.S., Muthu, K.S., Bashier, H.K., Azman, A., Ibrahim, S.Z., Face recognition with symmetric local graph structure (slgs) (2014) Expert Syst.

However, in order to do so, the system must first identify the state of the user. Studies in computer-based tutoring are increasingly investigating ways to incorporate synthetic tutors that are equipped with computational models of empathy – in which these agents are trained to understand learners’ emotions and respond based on the detected learner state. However, cultural differences affect the way people express and detect emotions. This paper attempts to identify the task-based features that could discriminate the learner’s emotions in a Malaysian context. By studying several existing task-based features from literature, and combining them with new features, this study attempts to detect four frequent emotions that accompanies learning, namely, frustration, boredom, uncertainty and neutral. A user study is conducted with 33 students and results revealed that certain features can be used as predictors for the abovementioned emotions. Interestingly, results also showed that there is a tendency for students to choose synthetic tutors of the same race. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Emotions; Empathy; Intelligent tutoring system; Task-based features,Computation theory; Computational methods; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Intelligent agents; Computational model; Cultural difference; Emotions; Empathy; Intelligent tutoring system; Malaysians; Task-based; User study; Multi agent systems,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6312153,The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the funding of this work from the grant no. 304/PKOMP/6312153.,,"Davis, M.H., (1994) Empathy: A Social Psychological Approach, , Westview Press, Boulder; Sabourin, J., Mott, B., Lester, J., Computational models of affect and empathy for pedagogical virtual agents Standards in Emotion Modeling, Lorentz Center International Center for Workshops in the Sciences; Aquino, R.J., Battad, J., Ngo, C.F., Uy, G., Trogo, R., Suarez, M., Towards empathic support provision for computer users (2012) Theory and Practice of Computation, 5, pp. 15-27. , Nishizaki, S.-H., Numao, M., Caro, J., Suarez, M.T.

Compared to 2D face images, 3D face images offer more granular cues that are not available in the 2D images. However, one major setback of 3D faces is that they impose a higher dimensionality than 2D faces. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem by proposing a fully automatic 3D facial expression recognition model that tackles the high dimensionality problem in a twofold solution. First, we transform the 3D faces into the 2D plane using conformal mapping. Second, we propose a Differential Evolution (DE) based optimization algorithm to select the optimal facial feature set and the classifier parameters simultaneously. The optimal features are selected from a pool of Speed Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptors of all the prospective facial points. The proposed model yielded an average recognition accuracy of 79% using the Bosphorus database and 79.36% using the BU-3DFE database. In addition, we exploit the facial muscular movements to enhance the probability estimation (PE) of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Joint application of feature selection with the proposed enhanced PE (EPE) yielded an average recognition accuracy of 84% using the Bosphorus database and 85.81% using the BU-3DFE database, which is statistically significantly better (at p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) if compared to the individual exploit of the optimal features only. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the visual human emotional cues, facial expressions are the most commonly used and understandable cues. Different machine learning techniques have been utilized to solve the expression recognition problem; however, their performance is still disputed. In this paper, we investigate the capability of several classification techniques to discriminate between the six universal facial expressions using Speed Up Robust Features (SURF). The evaluation were conducted using the BU-3DFE database with four classifiers, namely, Support Vector machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). Experimental results show that the SVM was successful in discriminating between the six universal facial expressions with an overall recognition accuracy of 79.36%, which is significantly better than the nearest accuracy achieved by Naïve Bayes at significance level p < 0.05. © 2014 IEEE.",3D Facial Expression Recognition; Human-computer interaction; k-nearest neighbors; Naïve Bayes; Neural Network; Support Vector machine,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Sodium; Support vector machines; 3-D facial expression recognition; Analysis and evaluation; Classification technique; Expression recognition; Human computer interaction (HCI); K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning techniques; Universal facial expressions; Face recognition,,,,,,,,"Segal, J., Jaffe, J., (2008) The Language of Emotional Intelligence, , McGraw-Hill Contemporary Learning; Bahreini, K., Nadolski, R., Westera, W., Towards multimodal emotion recognition in e-learning environments (2014) Interactive Learning Environments,no.

Motivated by this special characteristic, facial expression recognition rapidly gains attention in social computing fields, especially in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Identifying the optimal set of facial emotion markers is an important technique that not only reduces the feature vector dimensionality, but also impacts the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new emotion marker identification algorithm for automatic and person-independent 3D facial expression recognition system. First, we mapped the 3D face images into the 2D plane via conformal geometry to reduce the dimensionality. Then, the identification algorithm is designed to seek the best discriminative markers and the classifier parameters simultaneously by integrating three techniques viz., Differential Evolution (DE), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF). The proposed system yielded an average recognition rate of 79% and outperformed the previous studies using the Bosphorus database. © 2014 IEEE.",3D facial expression recognition; DE; Emotion marker identification; HCI; SURF; SVM,Algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Human computer interaction; Image retrieval; Information science; Optimization; Support vector machines; 3-D facial expression recognition; DE; Marker identifications; SURF; SVM; Face recognition,,,,,,,,"Ekman, P., Friesen, W.V., Measuring facial movement (1976) Environmental Psychology and Nonverbal Behavior, 1 (1), pp. 56-75; Pantic, M., Rothkrantz, L.J.M., Automatic analysis of facial expressions: The state of the art (2000) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22 (12), pp. 1424-1445; Sandbach, G., Zafeiriou, S., Pantic, M., Yin, L., Static and dynamic 3D facial expression recognition: A comprehensive survey (2012) Image and Vision Computing; Valstar, M.F., Mehu, M., Jiang, B., Pantic, M., Scherer, K., Metaanalysis of the first facial expression recognition challenge (2012) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42 (4), pp. 966-979; Storn, R., Price, K., Differential evolution-a simple and efficient heuristic for global optimization over continuous spaces (1997) Jornal of Global Optimization, 11 (4), pp. 341-359; Deb, K., Multi-objective optimization (2001) Multi-objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, pp. 13-46; Mishra, S., (2006) Global Optimization by Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Methods: Evaluation on Some Benchmark Functions, , 933827; Rosato, M., Chen, X., Yin, L., Automatic registration of vertex correspondences for 3D facial expression analysis (2008) 2nd IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems.

In the conventional EBGM approach, facial landmarks need to be chosen manually in the initial stage and a single graph per face had been modeled. Our proposed approach intuitively fuses a Harmony search based optimization algorithm over the EBGM approach to automatically choose optimal land marks for a given face. Further, instead of using a single graph, we deploy component level sub-graphs and locate optimal landmarks by maximizing the similarity between each of the sub-graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed automatic method achieves an improved recognition rate when compared to the conventional EBGM approach. © 2014 IEEE.",Elastic bunch graph maching; Face recognition; Facial occlusion; Harmony search; Similarity measure,Algorithms; Information science; Optimization; Pattern matching; Automatic method; Component levels; Elastic bunch graph matching; Elastic bunch graphs; Facial landmark; Facial occlusions; Harmony search; Similarity measure; Face recognition,,,,,,,,"Min, R., Hadid, A., Dugelay, J., (2011) Improving the Recognition of Faces Occluded by Facial Accessories, pp. 442-447. , March; Ekenel, H.M., Stiefelhagen, R., (2009) Why is Facial Occlusion A Challenging Problem, 5558, pp. 299-308; Martinez, A.M., Recognizing imprecisely localized, partially occluded, and expression variant faces from a single sample per class (2002) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 24 (6), pp. 748-763. , Jun; Wright, J., Yang, A., Ganesh, A., Sastry, S., Ma, Y., Robust face recognition via sparse representation (2009) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 31 (2), pp. 210-227. , Feb; Venkat, I., Khader, A.T., Subramanian, K., Wilde, P.D., Recognizing occluded faces by exploiting psychophysically inspired similarity maps (2013) Pattern Recognition Letters, 34 (8), pp. 903-911; Wiskott, L., Fellous, J.-M., Kuiger, N., Malsburg Der C.Von, Face recognition by elastic bunch graph matching (1997) Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 19 (7), pp. 775-779. , Jul; Bolme, D.S., (2003) Thesis on Elastic Bunch Graph Matching, , Ph.

A pairwise comparison between the baseline (non-adaptive) and NEMO-HIFI showed that the latter was not only statistically substantially preferred by users to the former, but they are also significantly more satisfied with it than the former. © 2013 Authors.","affective agent; affective hifi, spoken conversational agent; nemo; nemohifi; speech technology",Conversational agents; Emotional models; End users; Expressive speech; nemo; nemohifi; Pair-wise comparison; Speech technology; Interactive computer systems,,,,,,,,"Fernández-Martínez, F., Ferreiros, J., Lucas-Cuesta, J.M., Echeverry, J.D., San-Segundo, R., Córdoba, R., Flexible, Robust and Dynamic Dialogue Modeling with a Speech Dialogue Interface for Controlling a Hi-Fi Audio System Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2010), Springer, 2010; Fernández-Martínez, F., Ferreiros, J., Lucas-Cuesta, J.M., Montero, J.M., San-Segundo, R., Córdoba, R., Towards building intelligent speech interfaces through the use of more flexible, robust and natural dialogue management solutions (2012) Interacting with Computers, 24, pp. 82-498; Lorenzo-Trueba, J., Watts, O., Barra-Chicote, R., Yamagishi, J., King, S., Montero, J.M., Simple4All proposals for the Albayzin Evaluations in Speech Synthesis (2012) VII Jornadas de Tecnología del Habla (Iberspeech2012); Ekman, P., Friesen, W., (1978) The Facial Action Coding System: A Technique for the Measurement of Facial Movement, , Consulting Psychologists Press; Lutfi, S., Fernández-Martínez, F., Lucas-Cuesta, J., López-Lebón, L., A Satisfaction-based Model for Affect Recognition from Conversational Features in Spoken Dialog Systems (2013) Speech Communication, , Accepted for publication; Lutfi, S., User-centric Need-driven Affective Model for Spoken Conversational Agents: Design and Evaluation, , Unpublished Thesis.

In order to demonstrate the generation of affect through the use of the model, we describe the work of integrating it with a natural-language mixed-initiative HiFi-control spoken conversational agent (SCA). NEMO and the host system communicate externally, removing the need for the Dialog Manager to be modified, as is done in most existing dialog systems, in order to be adaptive. The first part of the paper concerns the integration between NEMO and the host agent. The second part summarizes the work on automatic affect prediction, namely, frustration and contentment, from dialog features, a non-conventional source, in the attempt of moving towards a more user-centric approach. The final part reports the evaluation results obtained from a user study, in which both versions of the agent (non-adaptive and emotionally-adaptive) were compared. The results provide substantial evidences with respect to the benefits of adding emotion in a spoken conversational agent, especially in mitigating users’ frustrations and, ultimately, improving their satisfaction. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Affect prediction; Affective agents; Contentment; Conversational features; Domotic applications; Emotion design and evaluation; Emotion model; Frustration; Spoken conversational agents; User satisfaction,Contentment; Conversational agents; Conversational features; Design and evaluations; Emotion modeling; Frustration; User satisfaction; Autonomous agents,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 248765, 287678",,,"Lutfi, S., Barra-Chicote, R., Lucas-Cuesta, J., Montero, J., NEMO: Need-Inspired Emotional Expressions within a Task-Independent Framework (2010) Proceedings of Brain Inspired Cognitive Systems (BICS), , Madrid, Spain, 14–16 July; Lucas-Cuesta, J., Ferreiros, J., Fernández-Martínez, F., Echeverry, J., Lutfi, S.L., On the dynamic adaptation of language models based on dialogue information (2012) Expect Syst.

In recent years, studies on affect detection from voice have moved on to using realistic, non-acted data, which is subtler. However, it is more challenging to perceive subtler emotions and this is demonstrated in tasks such as labeling and machine prediction. This paper attempts to address part of this challenge by considering the role of user satisfaction ratings and also conversational/dialog features in discriminating contentment and frustration, two types of emotions that are known to be prevalent within spoken human-computer interaction. However, given the laboratory constraints, users might be positively biased when rating the system, indirectly making the reliability of the satisfaction data questionable. Machine learning experiments were conducted on two datasets, users and annotators, which were then compared in order to assess the reliability of these datasets. Our results indicated that standard classifiers were significantly more successful in discriminating the abovementioned emotions and their intensities (reflected by user satisfaction ratings) from annotator data than from user data. These results corroborated that: first, satisfaction data could be used directly as an alternative target variable to model affect, and that they could be predicted exclusively by dialog features. Second, these were only true when trying to predict the abovementioned emotions using annotator's data, suggesting that user bias does exist in a laboratory-led evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We have developed a grammar generation strategy that automatically adapts the LMs using the semantic information that the user provides (represented as dialogue concepts), together with the information regarding the intentions of the speaker (inferred by the dialogue manager, and represented as dialogue goals). We carry out the adaptation as a linear interpolation between a background LM, and one or more of the LMs associated to the dialogue elements (concepts or goals) addressed by the user. The interpolation weights between those models are automatically estimated on each dialogue turn, using measures such as the posterior probabilities of concepts and goals, estimated as part of the inference procedure to determine the actions to be carried out. We propose two approaches to handle the LMs related to concepts and goals. Whereas in the first one we estimate a LM for each one of them, in the second one we apply several clustering strategies to group together those elements that share some common properties, and estimate a LM for each cluster. Our evaluation shows how the system can estimate a dynamic model adapted to each dialogue turn, which helps to significantly improve the performance of the speech recognition, which leads to an improvement in both the language understanding and the dialogue management tasks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This system integrates two main tools: a sign language into speech translation system and an SMS (Short Message Service) into speech translation system. The first tool is made up of three modules: an advanced visual interface (where a deaf person can specify a sequence of signs), a language translator (for generating the sequence of words in Spanish), and finally, an emotional text to speech (TTS) converter to generate spoken Spanish. The visual interface allows a sign sequence to be defined using several utilities. The emotional TTS converter is based on Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMMs) permitting voice gender, type of emotion, and emotional strength to be controlled. The second tool is made up of an SMS message editor, a language translator and the same emotional text to speech converter. Both translation tools use a phrase-based translation strategy where translation and target language models are trained from parallel corpora. In the experiments carried out to evaluate the translation performance, the sign language-speech translation system reported a 96.45 BLEU and the SMS-speech system a 44.36 BLEU in a specific domain: the renewal of the Identity Document and Driving License. In the evaluation of the emotional TTS, it is important to highlight the improvement in the naturalness thanks to the morpho-syntactic features, and the high flexibility provided by HSMMs when generating different emotional strengths. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we addressed user bias in their satisfaction judgements. We question the reliability of this data for modeling user emotion, focusing on contentment and frustration in a spoken dialog system. This bias is detected through machine learning experiments that were conducted on two datasets, users and annotators, which were then compared in order to assess the reliability of these datasets. The target used was the satisfaction rating and the predictors were conversational/dialog features. Our results indicated that standard classifiers were significantly more successful in discriminating frustration and contentment and the intensities of these emotions (reflected by user satisfaction ratings) from annotator data than from user data. Indirectly, the results showed that conversational features are reliable predictors of the two abovementioned emotions. © 2012 IEEE.",Affect detection; Contentment; conversational features; Frustration; Spoken Conversational Agent,Affect detection; Contentment; Conversational agents; conversational features; Frustration; Human computer interaction,,,,,,,,"Ai, H., Raux, A., Bohus, D., Eskenazi, M., Litman, D., Comparing spoken dialog corpora collected with recruited subjects versus real users (2007) 8th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue; Bailey, J.E., Pearson, S.W., Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction (1983) Management Science, 24, pp. 530-545; Callejas, Z., López-Cózar, R., Influence of contextual information in emotion annotation for spoken dialogue systems (2008) Speech Commun., 50 (5), pp. 416-433; Callejas, Z., López-Cózar, R., Relations between de-facto criteria in the evaluation of a spoken dialogue system (2008) Speech Commun., 50, pp. 646-665; Callejas, Z., López-Cózar, R., On the use of kappa coefficients to measure the reliability of the annotation of nonacted emotions (2008) Proceedings of the 4th IEEE Tutorial and Research Workshop on Perception and Interactive Technologies for Speech-Based Systems: Perception in Multimodal Dialogue Systems, PIT '08, pp. 221-232. , Berlin, Heidelberg.

The flexibility of our dialogue management approach, based on Bayesian Networks (BN), together with a contextual information module, which performs different strategies for handling such information, allows us to include user information as a new level into the Context Manager hierarchy. We propose a set of objective and subjective metrics to measure the relevance of the different contextual information sources. The analysis of our evaluation scenarios shows that the relevance of the short-term information (i.e. the system status) remains pretty stable throughout the dialogue, whereas the dialogue history and the user profile (i.e. the middle-term and the long-term information, respectively) play a complementary role, evolving their usefulness as the dialogue evolves.",Contextual information; Natural language processing; Real-user evaluation; Spoken language dialogue systems; User interfaces; User profiles,Contextual information; NAtural language processing; Real-user evaluation; Spoken language dialogue system; User profile; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Computational linguistics; Inference engines; Natural language processing systems; Speech processing; User interfaces; Information management,,,,,,,,"Callejas, Z., López-Cózar, R., Relations between de-facto criteria in the evaluation of a spoken dialogue system (2008) Speech Communication, 50, pp. 646-665; Chin, D., Empirical Evaluation of User Models and User-Adapted Systems (2001) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 11, pp. 181-194; Dybkjaer, L., Bernsen, N., Minker, W., Evaluation and usability of multimodal spoken language dialogue systems (2004) Speech Communication, 43, pp. 33-54; Fernández, F., Blázquez, J., Ferreiros, J., Barra, R., Macías-Guarasa, J., Lucas-Cuesta, J., Evaluation of a Spoken Dialogue System for Controlling a Hifi Audio System (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT08), pp. 137-140; Fernández, R., Ferreiros, J., Sama, V., Montero, J., San-Segundo, R., Macías-Guarasa, J., Speech Interface for Controlling a Hi-Fi Audio System Based on a Bayesian Belief Networks Approach for Dialog Modeling (2005) Proceedings of the 9th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (INTERSPEECH05), pp. 3421-3424; Gena, C., Methods and Techniques for the Evaluation of User-Adaptive Systems (2005) The Knowledge Engineering Review, 20 (1), pp. 1-37; Litman, D.J., Pan, S., Designing and evaluating an adaptive spoken dialogue system (2002) User Modelling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12 (2-3), pp. 111-137. , DOI 10.1023/A:1015036910358, Empirical Evaluation of User Models and User Modeling Systems; Lucas-Cuesta, J., Fernández, F., Salazar, J., Ferreiros, J., San-Segundo, R., Managing Speaker Identity and User Profiles in a Spoken Dialogue System (2009) Sociedad Espanola de Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural (SEPLN), 43, pp. 77-84. , ISSN: 1135-5948; Möller, S., Smeele, P., Boland, H., Krebber, J., Evaluating Spoken Dialogue Systems According to De-Facto Standards: A Case Study (2007) Computer, Speech and Language, 21, pp. 26-53; Walker, M., Litman, D., Kamm, C., Abella, A., PARADISE: A Framework for Evaluating Spoken Dialogue Agents (1997) Proceedings ACL/EACL, pp. 271-280; Zukerman, I., Litman, D., Natural language processing and user modeling: Synergies and limitations (2001) User Modelling and User-Adapted Interaction, 11 (1-2), pp. 129-158. , DOI 10.1023/A:1011174108613","Lucas-Cuesta, J.

Our proposal is based on the use of a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to deal with the temporal modelling of the emotional speech information. The selected features (MFCC, F0, Energy and their variants) are modelled as different streams, and the F0 related ones are integrated under a Multi Space Distribution (MSD) framework, to properly model its dual nature (voiced/unvoiced). Experimental evaluation on the challenge test set, show a 67.06% and 38.24% of unweighted recall for the 2 and 5-classes tasks respectively. In the 2-class case, we achieve similar results compared with the baseline, with a considerable less number of features. In the 5-class case, we achieve a statistically significant 6.5% relative improvement.

Previous studies on emotion theories were examined to draw up assumptions about emotions. These studies also include the findings from observations by anthropologists and researchers on culturalspecific emotions, particularly, the Malay culture. These findings were used to elicit the requirements for modeling affect in the TTS that conforms to the people of the Malay culture in Malaysia. The goal is to introduce a novel method for generating Malay expressive speech by embedding a localized'emotion layer'called eXpressive Text Reader Automation Layer, abbreviated as eXTRA. In a pilot project, the prototype is used with Fasih, the first Malay Text-to-Speech system developed by MIMOS Berhad, which can read unrestricted Malay text in four emotions: anger, sadness, happiness and fear. In this paper however, concentration is given to the first two emotions. eXTRA is evaluated through open perception tests by both native and non-native listeners. The results show more than sixty percent of recognition rate, which confirmed the satisfactory performance of the approaches.",,Emotion theories; Expressive speech; Malaysia; Non-native listeners; Pilot projects; Recognition rates; Text-readers; Text-to-speech system; Speech communication,,,,,,,,"Nass, C., Isbister, K., Lee, E., Truth is beauty: Researching embodied conversational agents (2000) Embodied Conversational Agents, pp. 374-402. , J.
