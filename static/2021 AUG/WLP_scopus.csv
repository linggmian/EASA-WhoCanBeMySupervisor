In order to enhance the performance of BCO, local optimisation can be integrated. However, local optimisation incurs high processing overhead especially when all solutions are allowed to undergo the local optimisation. This paper proposes a pruning strategy based on the top-k sequential patterns (TKS) mining algorithm. Specifically, TKS is employed to identify the frequent building blocks along the optimisation process. A total of 19 TSP benchmark problem instances ranging from 318 cities to 1,291 cities were used as the test bed. The proposed pruning strategy shows a significant reduction in terms of the computational time to yield TSP solutions with similar tour length as compared with two state-of-the-art approaches.

This neighbourhood search mechanism could not be directly applied to combinatorial discrete optimisation problems. In order to tackle combinatorial discrete optimisation problems, the employed and onlooker bees need to be equipped with problem-specific perturbative heuristics. However, a large variety of problem-specific heuristics are available, and it is not an easy task to select an appropriate heuristic for a specific problem. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic method, namely a Modified Choice Function (MCF), is applied such that it can regulate the selection of the neighbourhood search heuristics adopted by the employed and onlooker bees automatically. The Lin-Kernighan (LK) local search strategy is integrated to improve the performance of the proposed model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, 64 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances available in TSPLIB are evaluated. On average, the proposed model solves the 64 instances to 0.055% from the known optimum within approximately 2.7 min. A performance comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms further indicates the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bee algorithm; Combinatorial optimisation problem; Hyper-heuristic; Lin-Kernighan; Metaheuristic; Neighbourhood search","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Functions; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Traveling salesman problem; Bee Algorithm; Hyperheuristic; Lin-Kernighan; Metaheuristic; Neighbourhood search; Optimization",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE

Through these informative waggle dances, more bees are recruited toward exploring more profitable search regions. In the BCO-Linear algorithm, a fitter bee is allowed to dance longer, and the dance duration is determined by a linear function with a scaling parameter that requires manual tuning. This article presents a dynamic fuzzy-based dance mechanism, ie, the BCO-Fuzzy algorithm, to solve the manual tuning problem. A fuzzy-based approach is applied to regulate the duration of waggle dances instead of regulating the dance duration using a linear function. The proposed BCO-Fuzzy algorithm comprises parameters that are dynamically controlled based on the feedback of the search process, therefore overcoming the limitation of manual parameter tuning of the BCO-Linear algorithm. The BCO-Fuzzy algorithm is evaluated comprehensively using a set of benchmark traveling salesman problems. The experimental results show that the performance of the BCO-Fuzzy algorithm is comparable with that of the BCO-Linear algorithm. Specifically, the dynamic fuzzy-based dance mechanism improves the BCO algorithm in terms of rewarding dance instances near the inflection point. Performance comparison with other nature-inspired algorithms proves the effectiveness of the proposed BCO-Fuzzy algorithm. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bee colony optimization; dynamic parameter control; fuzzy logic; traveling salesman problem; waggle dance","Dynamics; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Traveling salesman problem; Bee colony optimization (BCO); Bee colony optimizations; Communication medium; Dynamic parameter control; Foraging behaviors; Nature inspired algorithms; Performance comparison; waggle dance; Parameter estimation",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE

A traditional hyper-heuristic model achieves this through a high-level heuristic that consists of two key components, namely a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance method. The effectiveness of the high-level heuristic is highly problem dependent due to the landscape properties of different problems. Most of the current hyper-heuristic models formulate a high-level heuristic by matching different combinations of components manually. This article proposes a method to automatically design the high-level heuristic of a hyper-heuristic model by utilizing a reinforcement learning technique. More specifically, Q-learning is applied to guide the hyper-heuristic model in selecting the proper components during different stages of the optimization process. The proposed method is evaluated comprehensively using benchmark instances from six problem domains in the Hyper-heuristic Flexible Framework. The experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable with most of the top-performing hyper-heuristic models in the current literature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Automatic design; Cross-domain heuristic search; Hyper-heuristic; Q-learning","Benchmarking; Design; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Problem solving; Reinforcement learning; Automatic design; Cross-domain heuristic searches; Heuristic selections; Hyperheuristic; Landscape properties; Optimization problems; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning techniques; Heuristic methods",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE

However, this neighbourhood search mechanism could not be directly applied to combinatorial discrete optimization problems. The employed and onlooker bees need to be equipped with problem-specific perturbative heuristics in order to tackle combinatorial discrete optimization problems. However, there is a large variety of available problem-specific heuristics. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic method, namely a Modified Choice Function (MCF), is applied such that it can regulate the selection of the neighbourhood search heuristics adopted by the employed and onlooker bees automatically. The proposed MCF-based ABC model is implemented using the Hyper-heuristic Flexible Framework (HyFlex). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, ten Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances available in HyFlex have been evaluated. The empirical results show that the proposed model is able to statistically outperform four out of five ABC variants throughout the optimization process. © 2017 IEEE.","Choice Function; Hyper-heuristic; Low level heuristics; Neighbourhood search heuristics","Cybernetics; Evolutionary algorithms; Functions; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Traveling salesman problem; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Choice function; Discrete optimization problems; Flexible framework; Hyperheuristic; Low level heuristics; Neighbourhood search; Optimization",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia

The provision of timely arrival time information is thus vital for passengers to minimize their waiting time and improve riders' confidence in the public transportation system, directly promoting more ridership. Multiple buses are commonly observed to arrive at a bus stop every hour. In this research, the prediction of estimated time of arrival (ETA) of buses is translated into a multi-label classification problem. Using buses historical global positioning system (GPS) arrival time, neural network models (ANN) are shown to be reliable solutions for the problem, and ensemble of neural networks are explored for more relevant output. The experimental results demonstrate that 77-78% of the time, ANN models are able to accurately predict arrival time of buses. The neural network models are able to outperform the other algorithms (i.e. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes) in the classification of multi-label arrival times by up to 8% based on performance metrics such as hamming loss, accuracy, and F1 scores.

However, during the discretization of firefly algorithm, one of the FA’s characteristics, i.e. the movement of a dimmer firefly towards a brighter firefly is unapparent as the movement are random. Thus, in this paper, the usage of swap operation as the movement strategy is proposed. The proposed algorithm, Swap-based Discrete Firefly Algorithm (SDFA), is then integrated with Nearest-Neighborhood initialization, reset strategy and Fixed Radius Near Neighbor 2-opt operator (FRNN 2-opt). The proposed algorithm is tested on 45 TSP instances and is compared with several states-of-the-art algorithm. The findings of this research show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively compared to the Discrete Firefly Algorithm, the Discrete Cuckoo Search, the Discrete Bat Algorithm, the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and the Discrete Bacterial Memetic Evolutionary Algorithm. On average, SDFA reports a percentage deviation of 0.02% from known optimum for TSP instances with dimension range from 14 to 318 cities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Combinatorial Optimization; Discrete optimization; Local search; Nature-inspired algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Bioluminescence; Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Problem solving; Traveling salesman problem; Discrete optimization; Discrete optimization problems; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Local search; Memetic evolutionary algorithms; Nature inspired algorithms; Nearest neighborhood; Percentage deviation; Optimization",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia","Acknowledgement.

This unique foraging behaviour has been computationally realized as an algorithmic tool named the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm to solve different types of Combinatorial Optimization Problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In order to enhance the performance of the BCO algorithm, it is integrated with a local optimization approach and a pruning strategy named as the Frequency-based Pruning Strategy (FBPS), which allows a subset of bees to undergo the local optimization and hence reduces the high processing overhead of the local optimization. Although the local optimization and the FBPS enhance the performance of the BCO algorithm, the FBPS becomes not scalable when building blocks in various sizes are considered in its pruning operation. This paper proposes a pruning strategy which employs the bi-directional extension (BIDE) based frequent closed pattern mining algorithm. It is named as the Frequent-closed-pattern-based Pruning Strategy (FCPBPS). The FCPBPS consists of two major operations: solutions accumulation and pruning operation. Solutions generated by bees are accumulated throughout the BCO algorithm execution. Based on the accumulated solutions, a set of frequent closed patterns in various sizes is mined using the BIDE algorithm. This set of frequent closed patterns is used in the FCPBPS pruning operation such that only relatively better bees (i.e. bees that produce solution which contains many of these frequent closed patterns) are allowed to undergo the local optimization. A total of 18 selected symmetric TSP benchmark problems range from 318 cities to 1291 cities are used as the testbed of this research. On average, the experimental results show that the FCPBPS requires 20.2% lesser computational time compared to the FBPS, to yield similar best-so-far TSP tour lengths. © 2015 IEEE.","combinatorial optimization problem; frequency-based pruning strategy; local search; meta-heuristic","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Traveling salesman problem; Bee colony optimizations; Combinatorial optimization problems; Foraging behaviours; Frequent closed pattern mining; Local optimizations; Local search; Metaheuristic; Pruning strategy; Optimization",,,,,,,,"Garey, M.R., Johnson, D.S., (1979) Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the T Heory of'Np-Completeness, , San Francisco: W.

This paper presents a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm with a local search named the modified two-enhancement scheme with neighbourhood N5 perturbation (BCO+mTESN5) to solve the JSSP. In previous research, the BCO algorithm with TESN5 local search (BCO+TESN5) is applied to solve the JSSP. The BCO+TESN5 algorithm uses a brute force strategy in performing the N5 neighbourhood local search. However, the brute force local search strategy incurs expensive overhead. To address the high overhead issue, the BCO+mTESN5 algorithm is proposed where the local search is performed on a targeted bottleneck machine within the N5 neighbourhood structure. The selection of the targeted bottleneck machine is done based on a list of bottleneck machines identified by the shifting bottleneck heuristic (SBH). Two selection strategies are tested to select the targeted bottleneck machine, namely: the greedy selection and the linear ranking selection. The proposed algorithms are examined using a set of benchmark problems obtained from the OR-library. The results show that the proposed BCO+mTESN5 with linear ranking selection successfully solves 54% of the 82 OR-library benchmark dataset to ≤ 1% from known optimum and it is comparable to the BCO+TESN5 algorithm.

Box 50, Al-Huson, Irbid, Jordan","The Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) algorithm is a recent stochastic swarm-based method that is useful for solving combinatorial and function optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an IWD ensemble known as the Master-River, Multiple-Creek IWD (MRMC-IWD) model, which serves as an extension of the modified IWD algorithm. The MRMC-IWD model aims to improve the exploration capability of the modified IWD algorithm. It comprises a master river which cooperates with multiple independent creeks to undertake optimization problems based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. A technique to decompose the original problem into a number of sub-problems is first devised. Each sub-problem is then assigned to a creek, while the overall solution is handled by the master river. To empower the exploitation capability, a hybrid MRMC-IWD model is introduced. It integrates the iterative improvement local search method with the MRMC-IWD model to allow a local search to be conducted, therefore enhancing the quality of solutions provided by the master river. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models, a series of experiments pertaining to two combinatorial problems, i.e., the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and rough set feature subset selection (RSFS), are conducted. The results indicate that the MRMC-IWD model can satisfactorily solve optimization problems using the divide-and-conquer strategy. By incorporating a local search method, the resulting hybrid MRMC-IWD model not only is able to balance exploration and exploitation, but also to enable convergence towards the optimal solutions, by employing a local search method. In all seven selected TSPLIB problems, the hybrid MRMC-IWD model achieves good results, with an average deviation of 0.021% from the best known optimal tour lengths. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the hybrid MRMC-IWD model produces the best results (i.e. the shortest and uniform reducts of 20 runs) for all13 selected RSFS problems.

Manual news transcription is too expensive and takes a long time. Hence, without an ASR system, access to audio archives and searches within them would be restricted to the limited number of textual documents that have been manually transcribed by humans or indexed with keywords. Multiple hypotheses are useful because the single best recognition output still has numerous errors, even for state-of-The-Art systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the word error rate (WER) in an ASR hypothesis. This approach is known as the three-pass combination method using parallel ASR systems. The three-pass combination system based on grapheme rescoring and phone rescoring re-evaluates all of the hypotheses produced by the ASR systems to produce a more accurate hypothesis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, Malay broadcast news contains speech from newscaster, reporter and interviewers in noisy environments recorded from Malaysia local news channels are employed. This approach reduced the WER by 4.4% from 34.5% to 30.1%. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with six approaches that are frequently used for ASR rescoring and combination. © 2015 IEEE.","ASR Combination; Automatic Speech Recognition; Broadcast News;

This approach combines the hypotheses produced by parallel automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Each ASR system uses different language models, one which is generic domain model and another is domain specific model. The main idea is to take advantage of different ASR knowledge to improve ASR decoding result. It uses the language score and time information to produce a 1-best lattice, and then rescore the 1-best lattice to get the most likely word sequence as the final output. The proposed approach was compared with conventional combination approach, the recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER). Our proposed approach improved the word error rate (WER) from 33.9% to 30.6% with an average relative WER improvement of 9.74%, and it is better than the conventional ROVER approach. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the selection method in the solution construction phase of the IWD algorithm. Instead of the fitness proportionate selection method in the original IWD algorithm, two ranking-based selection methods, namely linear ranking and exponential ranking, are proposed. Both ranking-based selection methods aim to solve the identified limitations of the fitness proportionate selection method as well as to enable the IWD algorithm to escape from local optima and ensure its search diversity. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed ranking-based selection methods, a series of experiments pertaining to three combinatorial optimization problems, i.e., rough set feature subset selection, multiple knapsack and travelling salesman problems, is conducted. The results demonstrate that the exponential ranking selection method is able to preserve the search diversity, therefore improving the performance of the IWD algorithm. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Solving ATSP is NP-hard and it is harder if the problem is with large scale data. This paper intends to address the ATSP using an hybrid approach which integrates the generic Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) framework and an insertion-based local search procedure. The generic BCO framework computationally realizes the bee foraging behaviour in a typical bee colony where bees travel across different locations to discover new food sources and perform waggle dances to recruit more bees towards newly discovered food sources. Besides the bee foraging behaviour, the generic BCO framework is enriched with an initialization engine, a fragmented solution construction mechanism, a local search and a pruning strategy. When the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of 27 ATSP benchmark problem instances, 37% of the benchmark instances are constantly solved to optimum. 89% of the problem instances are optimally solved for at least once. On average, the proposed BCO algorithm is able to obtain 0.140% deviation from known optimum for all the 27 instances. In terms of the average computational time, the proposed algorithm requires 48.955s (< 1 minutes) to obtain the best tour length for each instance. © 2013 IEEE.","bee foraging behaviour; generic framework; insertion; local search; metaheuristic","Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Local search (optimization); Operations research; Systems analysis; Foraging behaviours; Generic frameworks; insertion; Local search; Metaheuristic; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,,,,"Wong, L.P., Low, M.Y.H., Chong, C.S., A generic bee colony optimization framework for combinatorial optimization problems (2010) Proceedings or the 4th Asia International Conference on Mathematical/ Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation.

Solving SOP requires finding a feasible Hamiltonian path with minimum cost without violating the precedence constraints. SOP models myriad of real world industrial applications, particularly in the fields of transportation, vehicle routing and production planning. The main objective of this research is to propose an idea of solving SOP using the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm. The underlying mechanism of the BCO algorithm is the bee foraging behavior in a typical bee colony. Throughout the research, the SOP benchmark problems from TSPLIB will be chosen as the testbed to evaluate the performance of the BCO algorithm in terms of the solution cost and the computational time needed to obtain an optimum solution. Moreover, efforts are taken to investigate the feasibility of using the Genetic Algorithm to optimally tune the parameters equipped in the existing BCO model. On average, over the selected 40 benchmark problems, the proposed method has successfully solved 9 (22.5%) benchmark problems to optimum, 17 (42.5%) benchmark problems ≤ 1% of deviation from the known optimum, and 37 (85%) benchmark problems ≤ 5% of deviation from the known optimum. Overall, the 40 benchmark problems are solved to 2.19% from the known optimum on average. © 2014 IEEE.","combinatorial optimization problem; genetic algorithm; local search; metaheuristic; path repairing procedure","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Production control; Repair; Bee colony optimizations; Combinatorial optimization problems; Local search; Metaheuristic; Precedence constraints; Production Planning; Repairing procedures; Sequential ordering problems; Optimization",,,,,,,,"Montemanni, R., Smith, D.H., Rizzoli, A.E., Gambardella, L.M., Sequential ordering problems for crane scheduling in port terminals (2009) International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling, 5 (4), pp. 348-361; Spieckermann, S., Gutenschwager, K., Vob, S., A sequential ordering problem in automotive paint shops (2004) International Journal of Production Research, 42 (9), pp. 1865-1878; Wong, L.P., Low, M.Y.H., Chong, C.S., A generic bee colony optimization framework for combinatorial optimization problems (2010) Proceedings of the 4th Asia International Conference on Mathematical/ Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation.

It is a NP-hard problem [1]. This paper intends to find the shortest Hamiltonian circuit of the selected 68 towns/cities in Penang state, Malaysia using the generic Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) framework [2]. The proposed BCO framework realizes computationally the foraging process and waggle dance performed by bees and it is enriched with elitism, local optimization and adaptive pruning. A modification has been applied to the framework whereby a past solutions reinforcement policy is integrated. Also, the local optimization method is enhanced with the utilization of a Tabu list. The results from this study serve as an significant input to the preparation of logistics plan when a natural disaster occurs. Aiding resources can be delivered to affected areas, one after another, in a more appropriate and systematic manner and thus leads to cost and time saving. The results show that proposed BCO framework is able to produce a circuit (based on great-circle distance) with length of 263.332016km within 1.32s. The performance of the proposed BCO framework is comparable to the Genetic Algorithm and Lin-Ker heuristic. © 2011 IEEE.","Bee colony optimization; Generic framework; Hamiltonian circuit; Metaheuristic; Penang","Colony optimization; Generic frameworks; Hamiltonian circuit; Metaheuristic; Penang; Computational complexity; Optimization; Hamiltonians",,,,,,,,"Garey, M.R., Johnson, D.S., (1979) Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, , San Francisco: W.

Finding an optimum solution for COPs with large scale of data, constraints and variables is NP-hard. This paper proposed a generic Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) framework for COPs that mimics the foraging process and waggle dance performed by bees. The framework is designed and organized such that it is able to deal with different COPs and any enhancement on the framework will be applicable across all COPs. Besides mimicking the natural metaphor in a bee colony, the framework is enriched with elitism, local optimization and adaptive pruning. The BCO framework is tested on benchmark problems from Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). The results show that out of 229 benchmark problem instances, 203 or 88.65% of them record an average of deviation percentage from known optimum with less then 1%. © 2010 IEEE.","Adaptive pruning; Bee Colony Optimization; Combinatorial Optimization Problems; Framework; Metaheuristic","Bench-mark problems; Benchmark-problem instances; Colony optimization; Combinatorial optimization problems; Local optimizations; Metaheuristic; NP-hard; Optimum solution; Quadratic assignment problems; Combinatorial optimization; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Heuristic methods; Industrial applications; Mathematical models; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,,,,"Von Frisch, K., Decoding the language of the bee (1974) Science, 185 (4152), pp. 663-668; Garey, M.R., Johnson, D.S., (1979) Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, , San Francisco: W.

Examples of problems that belong to this category are transportation routing problem, scan chain optimization and drilling problem in integrated circuit testing and production. This paper presents a Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm for symmetrical TSP. The BCO model is constructed algorithmically based on the collective intelligence shown in bee foraging behaviour. The algorithm is integrated with a fixed-radius near neighbour 2-opt (FRNN 2-opt) heuristic to further improve prior solutions generated by the BCO model. To limit the overhead incurred by the FRNN 2-opt, a frequency-based pruning strategy is proposed. The pruning strategy allows only a subset of the promising solutions to undergo local optimization. Experimental results comparing the proposed BCO algorithm with existing approaches on a set of benchmark problems are presented. For 84 benchmark problems, the BCO algorithm is able to obtain an overall average solution quality of 0.31% from known optimum. The results also show that it is comparable to other algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Bee colony optimization; combinatorial optimization; local search; metaheuristic; traveling salesman problem","Ant-colony optimization; Bee colony optimization; Bench-mark problems; Collective intelligences; Colony optimization; Drilling problems; Hamiltonian path; Local optimizations; Local search; Metaheuristic; Minimum cost; Other algorithms; Pruning strategy; Routing problems; Scan chain; Solution quality; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic methods; Industrial applications; Integrated circuit testing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Problem solving; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,,"The authors wish to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia and the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia for the scholarship awarded to Li-Pei Wong to pursue his Ph.D. in the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.",,"Von Frisch, K., Decoding the language of the bee (1974) Science, 185 (4152), pp. 663-668; Dorigo, M., Stützle, T., The ant colony optimization metaheuristic: Algorithms, applications, and advances (2002) Handbook of Metaheuristics, International Series in Operations Research & Management Science, pp. 250-285. , Springer, New York; Kocay, W., Kreher, D.L., Hamilton cycles, in Graph, Algorithms and Optimization (2005) Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, 9, pp. 187-221. , Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, New York; Garey, M.R., Johnson, D.S., (1979) Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, , W.

This paper presents an improved bee colony optimisation algorithm with Big Valley landscape exploitation (BCBV) as a biologically inspired algorithm to solve the JSSP problem. The BCBV algorithm mimics the bee foraging behaviour where information of newly discovered food source is communicated via waggle dances. In the algorithm, the dances are treated as clusters of solutions to the JSSP. These clusters of solutions are distributed as a Big Valley landscape structure. Via a dance accumulation strategy as well as an effective search in multiple clusters in the entire landscape, the proposed algorithm is able to generate relatively good solutions for the JSSP. Experimental results comparing our proposed algorithm with the shifting bottleneck heuristic (SBP), the tabu search algorithm (TS) and the parameter-free genetic algorithm (PfGA) on the Taillard JSSP benchmark show that it is comparable to these approaches.

This foraging behaviour has been adapted in a Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm together with 2-opt local search to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) [1]. To reduce the high overhead incurred by 2-opt in the BCO algorithm proposed previously, two mechanisms named frequency-based pruning strategy (FBPS) and fixed-radius near neighbour (FRNN) 2-opt are presented. FBPS suggests that only a subset of promising solutions are allowed to perform 2-opt based on the accumulated frequency of its building blocks recorded in a matrix. FRNN 2-opt is an efficient implementation of 2-opt which exploits the geometric structure in a permutation of TSP sequence. Both mechanisms are tested on a set of TSP benchmark problems and the results show that they are able to achieve a 58.42% improvement while maintaining the solution quality at 0.02% from known optimal. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Bench-mark problems; Building blockes; Colony optimization; Efficient implementation; Food sources; Geometric structure; Local search; matrix; Pruning strategy; Solution quality; Benchmarking; Problem solving; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,,,,"Wong, L.P., Low, M.H.Y., Chong, C.S., Bee colony optimization with local search for traveling salesman problem (2008) Proc. of 6th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN 2008), pp. 1019-1025. , IEEE; Von Frisch, K., Decoding the language of the bee (1974) Science, 185 (4152), pp. 663-668; Biesmeijer, J.C., Seeley, T.D., The use of waggle dance information by honey bees throughout their foraging careers (2005) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 59 (1), pp. 133-142; Dyer, F.C., The biology of the dance language (2002) Annual Review of Entomology, 47, pp. 917-949; Nakrani, S., Tovey, C., On honey bees and dynamic server allocation in internet hosting centers (2004) Adaptive Behavior, 12 (3-4), pp. 223-240; Karaboga, D., Basturk, B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm (2007) Journal of Global Optimization, 39 (3), pp. 459-471. , DOI 10.1007/s10898-007-9149-x; On the performance of artificial bee colony (abc) algorithm (2008) Applied Soft Computing, 8 (1), pp. 687-697; Wedde, F.H., Farooq, M., Zhang, Y., Beehive: An efficient faulttolerant routing algorithm inspired by honey bee behavior (2004) Ant Colony, Optimization and Swarm Intelligence, pp. 83-94. , ser Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
