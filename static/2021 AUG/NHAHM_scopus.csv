Traditional drug discovery including in-vitro and in-vivo methods is a challenging, costly and time-consuming process. Thus, in-silico method was introduced where the Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) is predicted using computation methods. A reliable DTI prediction model would save a lot of time and costs for drug discovery since not all drug candidates but only the actives candidates would be further tested in the wet labs. In this paper, various binary classifier models have been developed to predict the activeness or inactiveness of compounds (drugs) from ChEMBL database against 11 activity classes (targets). The prediction methods used in this study are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Feed-forward Sequential Model (SEQ) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The molecular descriptors used to convert the SMILES chemical notation into binary fingerprint are Extended Connectivity Fingerprints 4 (ECFP4) and Maccs Key (MACCS). The results shows that the 11 predictive models have potential to be applied in real-world situation to predict the interaction of compounds against 11 target proteins as it is found that most machine learning and deep learning methods works better with data represented in ECFP4 compared to MACCS molecular descriptor. © 2021 IEEE.",ECFP4; MACCS; Naïve Bayes; Neural Networks; SMILES; SVM,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Drug interactions; Forecasting; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Support vector machines; Tensors; Binary classifiers; Binary fingerprints; Comparative studies; Computation methods; Drug-target interactions; Molecular descriptors; Prediction methods; Real world situations; Deep learning,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia via the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) – 203.PKOMP.6711800.",,"Pliakos, K., Vens, C., Drug-target interaction prediction with tree-ensemble learning and output space reconstruction (2020) BMC Bioinformatics, 21 (1), p. 1V; Sachdev, K., Gupta, M.K., A comprehensive review of feature based methods for drug target interaction prediction (2019) J.

In times of pandemics such as COVID-19, vulnerable people need help to survive. This help includes the distribution of relief packages and materials by the government with the primary objective of lessening the economic and psychological effects on the citizens affected by disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has not been an efficient way to monitor public funds’ accountability and transparency, especially in developing countries such as Nigeria. The understanding of public emotions by the government on distributed palliatives is important as it would indicate the reach and impact of the distribution exercise. Although several studies on English emotion classification have been conducted, these studies are not portable to a wider inclusive Nigerian case. This is because Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin), which Nigerians widely speak, has quite a different vocabulary from Standard English, thus limiting the applicability of the emotion classification of Standard English machine learning models. An Informal Nigerian English (Pidgin English) emotions dataset is constructed, pre-processed, and annotated. The dataset is then used to classify five emotion classes (anger, sadness, joy, fear, and disgust) on the COVID-19 palliatives and relief aid distribution in Nigeria using standard machine learning (ML) algorithms. Six ML algorithms are used in this study, and a comparative analysis of their performance is conducted. The algorithms are Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistics Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). The conducted experiments reveal that Support Vector Machine outperforms the remaining classifiers with the highest accuracy of 88%. The “disgust” emotion class surpassed other emotion classes, i.e., sadness, joy, fear, and anger, with the highest number of counts from the classification conducted on the constructed dataset. Additionally, the conducted correlation analysis shows a significant relationship between the emotion classes of “Joy” and “Fear”, which implies that the public is excited about the palliatives’ distribution but afraid of inequality and transparency in the distribution process due to reasons such as corruption. Conclusively, the results from this experiment clearly show that the public emotions on COVID-19 support and relief aid packages’ distribution in Nigeria were not satisfactory, considering that the negative emotions from the public outnumbered the public happiness. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, scientists and researchers dedicated tremendous time and efforts to prevent the growth of algal by monitoring and profiling the water quality index. However, provided that the expensive cost of the commercialised sensor, including the dynamic and causality of algae, complicated the process, this article discusses on the progress of a low-priced realtime monitoring system for water quality through the solar panel to perform preliminary studies on the water quality data. Profiling environmental readings is a crucial step in gaining an insight into the algal bloom growth. Furthermore, the real-time data collection from the system was continuously performed at the sea, leading to consistent data transfer to the server through a 3G network despite the remote monitoring. Notably, the two benefits of this system included the solution to the laborious process, which was based on manual sample collections. The second benefit was the database, which provided information on safe WQI for the fish farm and insight about algae growth, which could be used in the predictive modelling phase. © 2020 ACM.",Algae Bloom; Big Data; Dissolve Oxygen; Monitoring System; pH; Real-Time; Salinity; Temperature; Total Dissolved Solid (TDS); Turbidity; Water Quality; Water Quality Index (WQI),Algae; Aquaculture; Big data; Costs; Data transfer; Predictive analytics; Water quality; Harmful algal blooms; Predictive modelling; Real time data collections; Real-time monitoring systems; Remote monitoring; Water quality data; Water quality indexes; Water quality monitoring systems; Monitoring,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: TRGS/1/2018/USM/01/5/4-203

In this study, the influence of microclimate due to height variations and air infiltration were investigated for a building's energy and long-term thermal comfort performances. A 20-storey high-rise office building with full glass fa°ade in a hot and humid climate of Malaysia was studied using EnergyPlus to simulate the energy performance and RStudio programme for thermal comfort performance analysis. It was found that the building energy consumption reduced up to 2% when the air infiltration was removed from the building. However, the effect of microclimate showed insignificant reduction in energy consumption, but it had a significant difference in discomfort hours up to 17%. Air infiltration had less effect on thermal comfort with only 3 % reduction in discomfort hours. Microclimate should be considered to accurately evaluate the building performances in the densely built with high-rise buildings area. Removal of air infiltration from space helped in providing comfort and at the same time reduced the building energy consumption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Energy utilization; Office buildings; Tall buildings; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Building energy consumption; Building performance; Comfort performance; Energy performance; High rise building; High-rise office buildings; Hot and humid climate; Reduction in energy consumption; Energy conservation,,,,,"Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, UTHM

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) use single-locus analysis where each SNP is independently tested for association with phenotypes. The limitation with this approach, however, is its inability to explain genetic variation in complex diseases. Alternative approaches are required to model the intricate relationships between SNPs. Our proposed approach extends GWAS by combining deep learning stacked autoencoders (SAEs) and association rule mining (ARM) to identify epistatic interactions between SNPs. Following traditional GWAS quality control and association analysis, the most significant SNPs are selected and used in the subsequent analysis to investigate epistasis. SAERMA controls the classification results produced in the final fully connected multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) by manipulating the interestingness measures, support and confidence, in the rule generation process. The best classification results were achieved with 204 SNPs compressed to 100 units (77% AUC, 77% SE, 68% SP, 53% Gini, logloss = 0.58, and MSE = 0.20), although it was possible to achieve 73% AUC (77% SE, 63% SP, 45% Gini, logloss = 0.62, and MSE = 0.21) with 50 hidden units - both supported by close model interpretation. © 2013 IEEE.",Association rules; autoencoders; deep learning; epistasis; genome-wide association studies (GWAS); obesity,Association reactions; Association rules; Data mining; Deep learning; Genes; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Association rule minings (ARM); Classification results; Epistatic interactions; Genome-wide association studies; Interestingness measures; Multi layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN); Rule mining algorithms; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Quality control,,,,,,Samples and data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCoderProject.

Market segmentation is a widely used approach in investigating the heterogeneity of customer buying behavior and profitability. It is important to note that conventional market segmentation models in the retail industry are predominantly descriptive methods, lack sufficient market insights, and often fail to identify sufficiently small segments. This study also takes advantage of the dynamics involved in the Hadoop distributed file system for its ability to process vast dataset. Three different market segmentation experiments using modified best fit regression, i.e., Expectation-Maximization (EM) and K-Means++ clustering algorithms were conducted and subsequently assessed using cluster quality assessment. The results of this research are twofold: i) The insight on customer purchase behavior revealed for each Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) segment; ii) performance of the clustering algorithm for producing accurate market segments. The analysis indicated that the average lifetime of the customer was only two years, and the churn rate was 52%. Consequently, a marketing strategy was devised based on these results and implemented on the departmental store sales. It was revealed in the marketing record that the sales growth rate up increased from 5% to 9%. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Recent efforts have shown that topic modelling is vigorously used for this task. In this paper, we integrated word embedding into collapsed Gibbs sampling in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Specifically, the conditional distribution in the topic model is improved using the word embedding model that was trained against (customer review) training dataset. Semantic similarity (cosine measure) was leveraged to distribute the aspect-terms to their related aspect-category cognitively. The experiment was conducted to extract and categorize the aspect terms from SemEval 2014 dataset. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Aspect category; Aspect-based; LDA; Word embedding; Word-to-topic distribution,Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Statistics; Aspect category; Aspect-based; Conditional distribution; Latent dirichlet allocations; Semantic similarity; Topic distributions; Training dataset; Word embedding; Embeddings,,,,,"1001/PKOMP/8014002

Nevertheless, only a handful of machine learning (ML) studies have applied the personality model to assess criminality behaviour, particularly within the context of Malay social network messages. Based on the concept of sentiment valence, this study annotated a list of Malay Tweets that might be subjected to crime or illicit messages from the stance of Psychoticism trait. Consequently, the supervised-based text classification method was conducted by using Naïve Bayes (NB), Sequential Minimal Optimisation (SMO), and Decision Tree (DT) on Tweets using several features determined via Chi Square (x2). The analyses outcomes signified that SMO outperformed other classifiers insignificantly by achieving 92.85% of accuracy. Based on x2, several swear terms, such as bontot, melancap, and kote, displayed significant correlation with Psychoticism Tweets due to the nature of the trait that has been subjected to criminality behaviour, for instance, aggressive and antisocial attributes. The findings illustrate the possibilities to adapt several personality aspects in order to enhance the effectiveness in detecting illicit social network messages. © 2019, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Fragmenting SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size called LINGO Profiles avoids the otherwise time-consuming conversion process. One drawback of this process is the generation of numerous identical LINGO Profiles. Introduced by Kristensen et al, the inverted indexing approach represents a modification intended to deal with the large number of molecules residing in the database. Implementing this technique effectively reduced the storage space requirement of the dataset by half, while also achieving significant speedup and a favourable accuracy value when performing similarity searching.

In order to gain comprehension of the Quran in detail, it is vital for a Muslim to refer to Al-Hadith in clarifying ambiguities from the Quran. Al-Hadith offers explanations and lends certainties to the abstract concepts depicted in the Quran. With that, this research proposes a method using text categorisation to classify selected categories by determining the interrelation between the resources. Several interrelated cases were simulated by using a combination of different Islamic resources datasets comprising Quran and Hadiths. The selected three categories; Hajj, Prayer, and Zakat, were compared using three classification methods (Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)) via term weighting; Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). As a result, the SVM, regardless of being used alone or with term weighting, successfully addressed the interrelationship for single- and multi-label classifications. Additionally, SVM attained better accuracy with 10%–20% improvement, when compared to the other methods that had managed to exhibit slight improvement accuracy wise. © 2019 The Authors",KNN; Machine learning; NB; SVM; Text categorisation; TF-IDF,,,,,,,,,"Adeleke, A., Tun, U., Onn, H., (2017), Samsudin Comparative Analysis of Text Classification Algorithms for Automated Labelling of Quranic Verses (August); Aghahadi, Z., Word Embedding In Small Corpora : A Case Study in Quran.

These opinions serve as an important piece of knowledge for other reviewers. To figure out what the opinions is all about, an automatic system of analysis is needed. Aspect-based sentiment analysis is the most important research topic conducted to extract reviewers-opinions about certain attribute, for instance opinion-target (aspect). In aspect-based tasks, the identification of the implicit aspect such as aspects implicitly implied in a review, is the most challenging task to accomplish. However, this paper strives to identify the implicit aspects based on hierarchical algorithm incorporated with common-sense knowledge by means of dimensionality reduction. © 2018 IEEE.",analogy-based; aspect aggregation; HDP; implicit aspect extraction; online reviews; topic modeling,Data mining; Dimensionality reduction; Sentiment analysis; analogy-based; Automatic systems; Commonsense knowledge; Hierarchical algorithm; Online reviews; Opinion targets; Research topics; Topic Modeling; Image processing,,,,,,,,"Liu, B., (2017) Many Facets of Sentiment Analysis, pp. 11-39. , Springer, Cham; Medelyan, O., Milne, D., Legg, C., Witten, I.H., Mining meaning from Wikipedia (2009) Int.

Although there are many criminal activities occurring in financial industry, credit card fraudulent activities are among the most prevalent and worried about by online customers. Thus, countering the fraud activities through data mining and machine learning is one of the prominent approaches introduced by scholars intending to prevent the losses caused by these illegal acts. Primarily, data mining techniques were employed to study the patterns and characteristics of suspicious and non-suspicious transactions based on normalized and anomalies data. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to predict the suspicious and non-suspicious transactions automatically by using classifiers. Therefore, the combination of machine learning and data mining techniques were able to identify the genuine and non-genuine transactions by learning the patterns of the data. This paper discusses the supervised based classification using Bayesian network classifiers namely K2, Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN), and Naïve Bayes, logistics and J48 classifiers. After preprocessing the dataset using normalization and Principal Component Analysis, all the classifiers achieved more than 95.0% accuracy compared to results attained before preprocessing the dataset. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

The existing OPAC platform acts as a search engine for reading materials in the library is commonly complicated and not user friendly. The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is introduced in this project as part of a mobile application. NFC is a set of protocols on portable devices which perform wireless and contact-less short range, two-way communication between compatible devices. Transmission of data between devices is completed over radio waves and magnetic induction with passive NFC devices. As mobile devices, especially smartphones are more commonly utilized by users all around the world including university students, the proposed system would be able to enhance the performance of a library to be more convenient, secure, and more user friendly. Indirectly, the development of this mobile application can improve the visitation rates of students to the library by simplifying the searching, tracking reading materials and borrowing activities. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.",Android-based application; Library system; Mobile application; NFC technology; Smart university,Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio transmission; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Library systems; Mobile applications; Nfc technologies; Smart universities; The near field communication (NFC); Transmission of data; Two way communications; University students; Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Villen-Rueda, L., Senso, J.A., De Moya-Anegón, F., The use of OPAC in a large academic library: A transactional log analysis study of subject searching (2007) J Acad Librarianship, 33 (3), pp. 327-337; Arshad, A., Shafique, F., What do users prefer, card catalogue or OPAC?

Many companies, business or product sellers, has enabled customers to express their satisfaction level and feedback towards the services or products on their internet sites. This research focused on classifying the polarity of user reviews towards certain products or services provided. This paper proposed a method of extracting features from three different bags of words (unigram) and fit them into three machine learning algorithm SVM, Naïve Bayes and k Nearest Neighbours to build a polarity classification model. The data set for polarity classification discussed in this paper is based on the Cornell movie review data set. One of the previous bags of word methods used on product review from amazon.com were also adopted in this work to be applied on data set used to explicitly compare the performance of two approaches. The overall result indicates that the proposed bag of word method implemented here shows a better performance compared to the previous bag of word based on Amazon.com product review. Furthermore, it also indicates that the performance bag of word method using the product review from amazon.com decreases when used on movie review data set in this paper. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Natural Language Processing (NLP); Opinion mining; Polarity classification,,,,,,Universiti Malaya,This work was supported by Universiti,,"Pang, B., Lee, L., (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2, p. 1; Liu, B., (2010) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 25, p. 76; Cambria, E., Schuller, B., Xia, Y., Havasi, C., (2013) IEEE Intelligent Systems, p. 15; Tanawongsuwan, P., Product review sentiment classification using parts of speech (2010) 2010 3Rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (ICCSIT), , IEEE; Rain, C., Sentiment Analysis in Amazon Reviews Using Probabilistic Machine Learning; Ye, Q., Zhang, Z., Law, R., (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, p. 6527; Dang, Y., Zhang, Y., Chen, H., Intelligent Systems (2010) IEEE, 25, p. 46; Khan, A., Baharudin, B., Khan, K., (2011) Trends in Applied Sciences Research, 6, p. 1141","Malim, N.H.A.H.; School of Computer Sciences, Malaysia",,,American Scientific Publishers,,,,,19366612,,,,English,Adv.

With the increasing computing ability based on scale-out approach using cluster, many computational tasks have been made possible. Among these tasks, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with multiple hidden layers is one of the most active area due to its ability to learn complex model, which is one of the key requirement of artificial intelligence so that machines are able to make decision based on numerous factor combined in a complicated way. This study investigate feasibility of deployment of scalable ANN on cluster powered by Apache Spark Framework and to examine ANN’s performance on Apache Spark cluster using MNIST dataset which is a popular dataset. This document answers the question using an experimental approach, prototype is developed for experimental purpose and results are recorded and analyzed. ANN does not scale well by simply increasing number of cores, the communication overhead outweighs the parallelism benefits easily and thus need to be designed carefully, increasing network bandwidth is one of the possible solution. ANN’s performance does however scale linearly with respect to data size as expected. Number of neurons also affect ANN’s performance in a linear manner.

However, issue arises when cyberbullies are able to reach their victims through these social media platforms. There are different types of cyberbullying and like traditional bullying; it causes victims to feel overly selfconscious, increases their tendency to self-harm and generally affects their mental state negatively. Such situations occur due to security issues such as user anonymity and the lack of content restrictions in some social networks or web forums. In this paper, we highlight the existing solutions, which are Intrusion Prevention System and Intrusion Detection System from a number of researchers. However, even with such solutions, cyberbullying acts still occurs at an alarming rate. As such, we proposed an alternative solution that aims to prevent cyberbullying activities at a younger age, e.g., young children. The application would provide an alternative method to preventing cyberbullying activities among the younger generations in the future. © 2017 KIPS.",Cyberbullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion detection system; Mobile application; Social network,Computer crime; Mercury (metal); Social networking (online); Alternative solutions; Cyber bullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion prevention systems; Mobile applications; Social media platforms; Younger generations; Intrusion detection,,,,,,,,"Hanna, R., Rohm, A., Crittenden, V.L., ""We're all connected: the power of the social media ecosystem,"" (2011) Business Horizons, 54 (3), pp. 265-273; Wall, D.S., (2007) Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, , Cambridge, MA: Polity Press; Hinduja, S., Patchin, J.W., ""Bullying, cyberbullying, and suicide,"" (2010) Archives of Suicide Research, 14 (3), pp. 206-221; Patchin, J.W., Hinduja, S., (2012) Cyberbullying Prevention and Response: Expert Perspectives, , New York, NY: Routledge; Ribble, M., (2011) Digital Citizenship in Schools, , 2nd ed.

As a result, more and more users are utilizing such platforms to share their ideas and opinions to a wider audience. Young children who represents the new generation are also relying on this platform for many of their needs. Our research which was conducted among Malaysian children has found that such reliance is quite evident as well. As this need increases, the exposure to issues such as cyberbullying also increases. A survey was conducted among children from 9 to 12 years old in order to identify such reliance. The objective of this study is to identify the existing level of social media usages among Malaysian children. From the initial results, media sharing and social networking has become the most popular sites among the children. This indicates that further exploration into the usage trends among children as social media platforms becomes more utilized by the younger generation. © 2016 IEEE.",Children; Initial perspective; Social media; Web usage,Information science; Children; Cyber bullying; Initial perspective; Social media; Social media platforms; User-generated content; Web usage; Younger generations; Social networking (online),,,,,,,,"Leiner, B., Cerf, V., Clark, D., Kahn, R., Kleinrock, L., Lynch, D., Postel, J., Wolff, S., A brief history of the internet (2009) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 39 (5), pp. 22-31; O'Reilly, T., What is web 2.0: Design patterns and business models for the next generation of software (2007) Communications & Strategies, (1), p. 17; Bowe, B.J., Wohn, D.Y., Are there generational differences?

A lot of researches have been done to investigate the performance of TSS in different environment e.g. using MDDR database on Graphic Processing Unit GPU. However, TSS has not been tested with larger database such as ChEMBL database on similar platform. This has become the main motivation for this study to investigating the effect of different representation of chemical structures, binary and fragment occurrence descriptors towards the speed and adaptability in the architecture of GPU using TSS algorithm inside MDDR and ChEMBL database. At the end, this study gained that both parallel version of TSS using binary and fragment occurrence descriptors are scalable on the ChEMBL database. However, fragment occurrence descriptors performed better compared to binary descriptors. Therefore, this study could conclude that the complexity of the descriptors gives a bigger impact on the TSS's execution performance. © 2016 IEEE.",Binary descriptors; ChEMBL database; Chemoinformatics; Fragment occurrence descriptors; GPU; Parallel Turbo Similarity Search,Database systems; Information science; Chemoinformatics; Descriptors; Execution performance; GPU implementation; Graphic processing units; Similarity search; Similarity Searching; Virtual Screening; Bins,,,,,,,,"Aktar, W.M., Murmu, S., (2008) Chemoinformatics: Principle and Applications, pp. 1-28; Zainal, A.A., Yusri, N., Malim, N., Arif, S.M., The influence of similarity measures and fusion rules toward turbo similarity searching (2013) Procedia Technology, 11, pp. 823-833; Cereto-Massagué, A., Ojeda, M.J., Valls, C., Mulero, M., Garcia-Vallvé, S., Pujadas, G., Molecular fingerprint similarity search in virtual screening (2015) Methods, 71, pp. 58-63. , 1 January; Hert, J., Willett, P., Wilton, D.J., Comparison of fingerprint-based methods for virtual screening using multiple bioactive reference structures (2004) Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44, pp. 1177-1185; Bajusz, D., Rácz, A., Héberger, K., Why is Tanimoto index an appropriate choice for fingerprint-based similarity calculations?

This study investigates these problems by choosing group fusion as a pilot model and presents efficient parallel solutions in parallel platforms, specifically, the multi-core architecture of CPU and many-core architecture of graphical processing unit (GPU). A study of sequential group fusion and a proposed design of parallel CUDA group fusion are presented in this paper. The design involves solving two important stages of group fusion, namely, similarity search and fusion (MAX rule), while addressing embarrassingly parallel and parallel reduction models. The sequential, optimized sequential and parallel OpenMP of group fusion were implemented and evaluated. The outcome of the analysis from these three different design approaches influenced the design of parallel CUDA version in order to optimize and achieve high computation intensity. The proposed parallel CUDA performed better than sequential and parallel OpenMP in terms of both execution time and speedup. The parallel CUDA was 5-10x faster than sequential and parallel OpenMP as both similarity search and fusion MAX stages had been CUDA-optimized. © 2016 KIPS.",Chemoinformatics; Graphical processing unit; Group fusion; Open multiprocessing; Virtual screening,Application programming interfaces (API); Graphics processing unit; Query processing; Chemoinformatics; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Graphical processing units; Many-core architecture; Multi core and many cores; Multicore architectures; Open multiprocessings; Virtual Screening; Computer architecture,,,,,,,,"Gasteiger, J., Chemoinformatics: a new field with a long tradition (2006) Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 384 (1), pp. 57-64; Walters, W.P., Stahl, M.T., Murcko, M.A., Virtual screening: an overview (1998) Drug Discovery Today, 3 (4), pp. 160-178; Willett, P., Barnard, J.M., Downs, G.M., Chemical similarity searching (1998) Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 38 (6), pp. 983-996; Hert, J., Willett, P., Wilton, D.J., Acklin, P., Azzaoui, K., Jacoby, E., Schuffenhauer, A., Enhancing the effectiveness of similarity-based virtual screening using nearest-neighbor information (2005) Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 48 (22), pp. 7049-7054; Willett, P., Combination of similarity rankings using data fusion (2013) Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 53 (1), pp. 1-10; Hert, J., Willett, P., Wilton, D.J., Acklin, P., Azzaoui, K., Jacoby, E., Schuffenhauer, A., Comparison of fingerprint-based methods for virtual screening using multiple bioactive reference structures (2004) Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44 (3), pp. 1177-1185; Whittle, M., Gillet, V.J., Willett, P., Alex, A., Loesel, J., Enhancing the effectiveness of virtual screening by fusing nearest neighbor lists: a comparison of similarity coefficients (2004) Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44 (5), pp. 1840-1848; Vogt, M., Bajorath, J., Chemoinformatics: a view of the field and current trends in method development (2012) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 20 (18), pp. 5317-5323; Sanchez-Linares, I., Perez-Sanchez, H., Garcia, J.M., 'Accelerating grid kernels for virtual screening on graphics processing units' (2001) Applications, pp. 413-420. , Tools, and Techniques on the Road to Exascale Computing.

TSS however consumes lots of computation time due to the number of searches and fusion carried out in the second phase of its procedure. Hence, TSS would not be able to cater the increase in the chemical database size due to this limitation. With the emergence of the parallel technology, this research looks into accelerating TSS on the widely-used many-cores i.e. the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and multi-cores platform. This would not only solve the computational time issue but also the cost as GPUs can be obtained at a lower cost. Hence, the implementation of TSS will help the medicinal chemist to execute the virtual screening in an accurate and fast manner. This study investigates the best possible method to parallelize TSS via experimentation of three parallel designs; two designs were implemented on GPU platform using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) API namely CUDA 1 and CUDA 2 whilst one design was implemented on multi-core platform using OpenMP API. The CUDA 1 design had shown tremendous speedup and low GPU-memory utilization as compared to CUDA 2 design. In general observation, the parallel CUDA 1 was 131 times faster than sequential and 51 times faster than parallel OpenMP. This leads to the conclusion that CUDA 1 design as the best parallel design for TSS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Compute unified device architecture platform; Graphical processing unit (GPU); Open multiprocessing; Turbo similarity searching; Virtual screening,Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Design; Memory architecture; Program processors; Compute unified device architectures; Graphical processing units; Open multiprocessings; Similarity Searching; Virtual Screening; Computer architecture,,,,,,,,"Gasteiger, J., (2003) Handbook of Chemoinformatics, , ed; Johnson, M.A., Maggiora, G.M., (1990) Concepts and Applications of Molecular Similarity; Zainal, A., Yusri, N., Malim, N., Arif, S.M., The influence of similarity measures and fusion rules toward turbo similarity searching (2013) International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics; Whittle, M., Enhancing the effectiveness of virtual screening by fusing nearest neighbor lists: A comparison of similarity coefficients (2004) J.

Existing researches have shown that new systems require novice users to spend an amount of time to get to know the technology. Near Field Communication (NFC) is an emerging technology, which offers an enhanced interaction for users by simplifying data transfers, secured payment transaction access and many more. In this paper, we looked into a number of widely used acceptance models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory Planned Behavior (TPB) and, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to identify the theory that is best suited as an assessment tool of the user acceptance to the NFC technology. We have identified UTAUT as the best tool based on literature and utilized the theory to develop a questionnaire for the user acceptance survey. Our results indicates, factors such as social influence and facilitating condition affected the users' technology acceptance for NFC where most respondents are willing to use the technology if they had the chance to do so. © 2015 IEEE.",Near Field Communication; Technology Acceptance Model; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology,Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Industrial management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Surveys; Emerging technologies; Facilitating conditions; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; The near field communication (NFC); The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Theory of reasoned action; Unified theory; Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Steffen, R., Preiinger, J., Schöllermann, T., Müller, A., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an automative environent (2010) Second International Workshop on Near Field Communication, pp. 15-20. , April; Dillon, A., Morris, M., User acceptance of information and technology: Theories and models (1996) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 31, pp. 3-32; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340; Venkatesh, V., Davis, F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies (2000) Management Science, 2, pp. 186-204. , February; Venkatesh, V., Creation of favorable user perceptions: Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation (1999) MIS Quarterly, 2, pp. 239-260. , June; Venkatesh, V., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view (2003) MIS Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 425-478. , September; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Believe, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior:An Introduction to Theory and Research, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Au, S., Parameswaran, N., Problem solving with attitude and the theory of reasoned action (2003) IEEE/WIC International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology IEEE, pp. 1-4. , October; Teh, P., Ahmed, P.K., MOA and TRA in social Commerce: An intergrated model (2011) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management Singapore IEEE, pp. 1375-1378. , December; Sogani, S., Muduganti, R., Hexmoor, H., Davis, F., Introducing agent based implementation of the theory of reasoned action: A case study in user acceptance of computer technology (2005) KIMAS International Conference IEEE, pp. 507-510. , April; Ajzen, I., (2006) Constructing A Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire, pp. 1-12. , http://people.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.measurement.pdf; Lin, T.C., Hsu, M.H., Kuo, F.Y., Sun, P.C., An intention Model-based study of software piracy (1999) 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences IEEE, , January; Lu, Y., Zhou, T., Wang, B., Exploring Chinese user' acceptance of instant messaging using the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, and the flow theory (2009) Computer in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 29-39. , January; Lin, J., Chan, H.C., Wei, K.K., Understanding competing web application platforms : An extended theory of planned behavior and its relative model (2011) Engineering Management, 58. , February; Wu, Y., Tao, Y., Yang, P., Using UTAUT to explore the behavior of3G mobile communication users (2007) Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) Singapore IEEE, pp. 209-212. , December; Gao, T., Deng, Y., A study on users' acceptance behavior to mobile E-books application based on UTAUT model (2012) ICSESS3rd International Conference Beijing IEEE, p. 376. , June",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2nd International Symposium on Technology Management and Emerging Technologies, ISTMET 2015",25 August 2015 through 27 August 2015,,118506,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Int.

Text mining is an interdisciplinary field which depends on information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, parameter statistics and computational linguistics. Standard text mining and retrieval information techniques of text document usually rely on similar categories. An alternative method of retrieving information is clustering documents to preprocess text. The preprocessing steps have a huge effect on the success to extract knowledge. This study implements TF-IDF and singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensionality reduction techniques. The proposed system presents an effective preprocessing and dimensionality reduction techniques which help the document clustering by using k-means algorithm. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the performance of English text document clustering. Simulation results on BBC news and BBC sport datasets show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.",clustering; clustering; dimension reduction; k-means; retrieval information; singular value decomposition; Text mining,Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Reduction; Singular value decomposition; Text processing; clustering; Dimension reduction; K-means; retrieval information; Text mining; Data mining,,,,,,,,"Wong, M.K., Abidi, S.S.R., Jonsen, D., A multi-phase correlation search framework for mining non-taxonomic relations from unstructured text (2014) Knowledge and Information Systems, 38 (3), pp. 641-667; Han, J., Kamber, M., (2006) Data Mining, Southeast Asia Edition: Concepts and Techniques, , Morgan kaufmann; Larose, D.T., (2014) Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining, , John Wiley & Sons; Ahmad, R., Khanum, A., Document topic generation in text mining by using cluster analysis with EROCK (2008) International Journal of Computer Science & Security (IJCSS), 4 (2), p. 176; Karypis, G., Han, E.H., Kumar, V., Chameleon: Hierarchical clustering using dynamic modeling (1999) Computer, 32 (8), pp. 68-75; Zhang, T., Ramakrishnan, R., Livny, M., BIRCH: An efficient data clustering method for very large databases (1996) ACM SIGMOD Record, 25 (2); Ramasundaram, S., Victor, S.P., Text categorization by backpropagation network (2010) International Journal of Computer Applications, 8, pp. 1-5; Banchs, R.E., (2012) Text Mining with MATLAB, , Springe",,Al-Dabass D.Saad I.Mohamad K.A.Hijazi M.H.A.,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology, ICAIET 2014",2 December 2014 through 5 December 2014,,118813,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

This paper describes a framework for Collaborative Online Arabic Learning software towards understanding Quran (COAL-UQ). The objectives of COAL-UQ are to provide users an online tools for learning Arabic anytime and anywhere, to ease the non-Arabic speakers in understanding the messages and meanings of the Quran and to exploit existing learning tools for learning a new language. We implement the Think-Pair-Share method introduced by Lyman in 1981 in the collaborative software. The software also integrates other online learning tools and utilizes the tools to realize the Think-Pair-Share method. We provide video conferencing tools so users can have face-to-face interactions with human tutor.

The inventions of online networks technologies and applications such as social networks rapidly growth the size of digital textual data and indirectly raises the curiosities to mine the juicy information encapsulated in the text data. Researchers have stated that linguistics of the people either in the online or offline having strong correlations with their self-disclosure. The mass creations of digital textual data raised the intentions of scholars to study the hidden abstractions of personality by applying automatic personality detection approaches. Most of the current automatic personality detection studies focused on Big 5 personality model as a framework to study the underlying characteristics of human. As such, this study incorporates the Three Factor Personality (PEN) Model as a personality framework to guide our understanding and revealing the role of words in depicting the characteristics of a user. This preliminary study revealed how the sentiment perceptions of public towards specific words could assist us in detecting the personality of Facebook users by exploiting their status messages. As the first phase of our study, this experiment focuses on gathering the general perceptions of Malaysians towards 52 English words and 17 interjections that was retrieve from the domain stated above. A Likert scale questionnaire executed to find the sentiment valences of 67 words through analyzing responses from participants and statistical significance will assist the categorization of words under PEN traits. The evaluation provides the necessary analysis that could assist our main research that focuses on automatic personality detections specifically on the psychoticism trait. Our initial findings has highlighted that the five words categorized under psychoticism has strong Cronbach's Alpha coefficients and significant effect from multivariate analysis that indirectly affirmed the reliability of the categorization of the words. © 2015 The Authors.",Automatic Personality Perception; Sentiment valence; Three Factor Model,Information systems; Multivariant analysis; Reliability analysis; Social sciences computing; Automatic personality perceptions; Multi variate analysis; On-line social networks; Personality detections; Sentiment valence; Statistical significance; Technologies and applications; Three-factor model; Social networking (online),,,,,,,,"Tolga Aricak, O., Psychiatric Symptomatology as a Predictor of Cyberbullying among University Students (2009) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 34, pp. 167-184. , Winter, 2009; Ellis, (2008) The Study of Personality, , http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/23238_Chapter_1.pdf; Matthews, G., Deary, I., Martha, C., (2003) Personality Traits, , (2nd edition).Cambridge University Press; Kirwan, G., Power, A., (2011) The Psychology of Cyber Crime: Concepts and Principles, , ISR; Rahim Kamaluddin, M., Syariani Md Shariff, N., Othman, A., Hj Ismail, K., Ayu Mat Saat, G., Linking psychological traits with Criminal behavior: A review (2015) Linking Pychological Traits with Criminal Behaviour: A Review ASEAN Journal of Psychiatry, 16 (2). , July - December 2015: XX-XX; Mairesse, F., Using Linguistic Cues for the Automatic Recognition of Personality in Conversation and Text Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30 (2007), pp. 457-500; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings (1999) Technical Report C-1, the Center for Research in Psychophysiology, , University of Florida; Arup Nielsen, F., A new ANEW: Evaluation of a word list for sentiment analysis in microblogs (2011) Proceedings of the ESWC2011 Workshop on 'Making Sense of Microposts': Big Things Come in Small Packages 718 in CEUR Workshop Proceedings, , 93-98. 2011 May; Vasa, R.A., Valence ratings of emotional and non-emotional words in children (2004) Personality and Individual Differences, 41, pp. 1169-1180; Oberlander, J., Nowson, S., Whose thumb is it anyway?

However, due to its portability and information available through social network, BYOD has become susceptible to information stealing attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT attack uses tricky methods in getting access into the target’s machine and mostly motives and stand as a threat to politics, corporate, academic and even military. Various mitigation techniques have been proposed in tackling this attack but, most of them are relying on available information of the attacks and does not provide data protection. Hence, it is challenging in providing protection against APT attack. In this paper, we will investigate on the available mitigation techniques and its problems in tackling APT attack by looking on the root cause of the attack inside BYOD environment. Lastly, based on the information obtained we will propose a new framework in reducing APT attack. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Access control; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model; Framework; MLS,Security of data; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Control framework; Framework; Mitigation techniques; MLS; Multi-level security; Threat mitigation; Access control,,,,,,,,"Fischer, N., Smolnik, S., The impact of mobile computing on individuals, organizations, and society - synthesis of existing literature and directions for future research (2013) IEEE 2013 46Th Hawaii International Conference System Sciences (HICSS), pp. 1082-1091; Dover, S., CBS News, Study: Number of Smartphone Users Tops 1 Billion, , http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57534583/; La Polla, M., Martinelli, F., Sgandurra, D., A Survey on Security for Mobile Devices (2013) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15 (1), pp. 446-471; Fossi, M., Egan, G.Y., Haley, K., Johnson, E., Mack, T., Adams, T., Blackbird, J., Wood, P., (2011) Symantec Internet Security Threat Report – Trends for 2010, 16. , Technical Report Volume, Symantec; Mobile Security Reference Architecture, Federal CIO Council and Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Program Directorate Office of Cybersecurity and Communications Federal Network Resilience (2013); Schmidt, A., Schmidt, H., Batyuk, L., Clausen, J.H., Camtepe, S.A., Albayrak, A., Smartphone malware evolution revisited: Android next target?

To date, there are various types of attendance systems that are applying different technologies such as biometrics, tokens and sensors such as RFID. The latest is by applying near-field communication (NFC), a sensor within the smartphone has been used as a mean for recording attendances. The aim of this paper is to list out the possible security attacks against NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled systems by focusing on a student-based attendance system. A brief overview over NFC technology and discussion on various security attacks against NFC in different media is presented. Overall, an attendance system is compromised mainly by tag swapping, tag cloning and manipulation of data occurring on the NFC device and operational server. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Attendance system; Mitigations; Near Field Communication (NFC); Security attack,Artificial intelligence; Mobile telecommunication systems; Students; Attendance systems; Mitigations; Nfc technologies; Security attacks; Security challenges; Student-based; Tag swapping; The near field communication (NFC); Near field communication,,,,,,,,"Özdenizci, B., Aydin, M., Coskun, V., Kerem, O.K., NFC Research Framework: A Literature Review and Future Research Directions, , Information Technologies Department, ISIK University, Istanbul; Madlmayr, G., Langer, J., Scharinger, J., Kantner, C., NFC Devices: Security and Privacy The Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security; Francis, L., Hancke, G., Mayes, K., Markantonakis, K., Practical NFC peer-to-peer relay attack using mobile phones (2010) Rfidsec 2010.

The impact of this global ageing phenomenon is significant to the human life in all aspect including social, political and economic of all social class. The implementation of ICT application can help to cope with this phenomenon and improve the quality of life of the elderly. This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis on the field of ageing and ICT to reveal the trend of research and technologies related in the recent years. Bibliometric information such as keywords and number of publication is extracted from the search result of online publication databases and then further analyzed using computational technique such as growth rate analysis and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to identify the relationship and the growth of the information extracted. The outcome is a set of terms that are grouped and ranked according to their relevance and growth in the recent year. This result can then provide a brief understanding on the trend of ageing and ICT for the researchers that wish to research on this field. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

Most of the current research on mobile organizers highlights that most users rely on the application as an effective tool to manage their daily activities especially among university students. A mobile organizer application is software that acts as a personal assistant for users to help them manage their time and activities. From a Malaysian context, the usage of these applications among university students has not been explored in-depth. The aim of this paper is to initially explore the current usage of mobile organizers within a Malaysian university specifically Universiti Sains Malaysia. There are a number of requirements that a mobile organizer application should fulfil, in order to be effective for users. In order to identify these requirements, an initial survey was conducted in order to identify these requirements, which, would then be incorporated into the development of a mobile organizer suitable for Malaysian university students. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Applications; Mobile organizers; Software,,,,,,,,,"Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013-2018 (2014), Cisco VNI Forecast, White paper edn.

However, even with the simplicity and security that the technology provide, the adoption of this technology is not widespread. In this paper, we describe the user-friendliness criteria essential for NFC technology through a proposed library system. To determine the criteria of user-friendliness for the technology, we conducted a survey on the understanding and usage of different users that would be exposed to a library system. The survey included questions about the existing library system (OPAC) and their perception of the NFC technology. Based on the results, we managed to identify that the OPAC system is not a userfriendly library system. Further, we have also identified that there are three main user-friendliness criteria deemed necessary by users for an NFC-enabled library system to be more effective than the OPAC system: usability, security and efficiency. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Near-field communication; OPAC system; Radio frequency identification (RFID),,,,,,,,,"Steffen, R., Preibinger, J., Schollermann, T., Muller, A., Schnabel, I., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an Automotive Environment: Use Cases, Architecture and Realization.

This study aims to determine the best similarity coefficient to be used for virtual screening task using chemical databases. We calculated the structural resemblance between each pair of chemical structures in their own activity class to get the Mean Pairwise Similarity (MPS) value to see the nature of heterogeneity for each natural product and synthetic chemical databases. The process involves the 2D descriptor of type ECFC4 fingerprint to represent each structure and Tanimoto coefficient to calculate the similarity score between each pair of chemical structures in the same activity class. MPS for an activity class was obtained by taking the average of all similarity scores within that class. Next, three types of similarity coefficients have been used to calculate the similarity score between a query structure and each of the database structure. The results indicate that Tanimoto coefficient shows better performance compared to Russell Rao and Forbes in retrieval task using chemical database. This implies that Tanimoto coefficient is recommended to carry out virtual screening in drug development. More work should be carried out to determine the best combination of similarity coefficient and fingerprint type to get optimal retrieval performance. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2015.",Chemoinformatics; Mean pairwise similarity; Retrieval; Similarity search; Virtual screening,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, P.M., Sjöström, M., Wold, S., Lundstedt, T., Comparison between physicochemical and calculated molecular descriptors (2000) J.

Similarity searches use 2D or 3D fingerprints and similarity coefficient to calculate the structural resemblance between each molecule in a chemical database and a target structure. The objective of this work is to determine the best coefficient to be used in similarity searching to get the optimal results. This paper will describe the experiment to perform the molecular similarity searching using different similarity coefficients, which focus on 2D UNITY or ECFP4 fingerprint on 5 activity classes. We will also highlight the different similarity values and the optimal results of similarity measures. All this could depend on what type of fingerprint. As a conclusion, we found that every combination measure has its own advantage.

Therefore, feature extraction (FE) plays a vital role in topic classification in particular and text mining in general. FE based on cosine similarity score is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of features, which can be impossible to process further. In this study, TF-IDF term weighting is used to extract features. Selecting relevant features and determining how to encode them for a learning machine method have a vast impact on the learning machine methods ability to extract a good model. Two different weighting methods (TF-IDF and TF-IDF Global) were used and tested on the Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection. The obtained results emerged a good candidate for enhancing the performance of English topics FE. Simulation results the Reuters-21578 text categorization show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.",cosine similarity score; feature extraction; TF-IDF weighting; topic classification,Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Text processing; Cosine similarity; High dimensionality; Learning machines; Relevant features; Text categorization; TF-IDF weighting; Topic Classification; Weighting methods; Data mining,,,,,,,,"Ayache, S., Quénot, G., Gensel, J., (2007) Classifier Fusion for SVM-based Multimedia Semantic Indexing, pp. 494-504. , Springer: Berlin-Heidelberg; Sadiq, A.T., Abdullah, S.M., Hybrid intelligent technique for text categorization (2012) IEEE, pp. 238-245; Benfriha, H., Barigou, F., Atmani, B., (2013) Lattice-cell: Hybrid Approach for Text Categorization, pp. 1311-4151. , arXiv preprint arXiv; Metzler, D., Dumais, S., Meek, C., (2007) Similarity Measures for Short Segments of Text., pp. 6-27. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Forman, G., An extensive empirical study of feature selection metrics for text classification (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning, 3, pp. 1289-1305; Soucy, P., Mineau, G.W., Beyond TFIDF weighting for text categorization in the vector space model (2005) IJCAI, 5, pp. 1130-1135; Turney, P.D., Pantel, P., From frequency to meaning: Vector space models of semantics (2010) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 37 (1), pp. 141-188; Ikonomakis, M., Kotsiantis, S., Tampakas, V., Text classification using machine learning techniques (2005) WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 4 (8), pp. 966-974; Kamruzzaman, S.M., Haider, F., (2010) A Hybrid Learning Algorithm for Text Classification, pp. 1009-4574. , arXiv preprint arXiv; Shi, K., Efficient text classification method based on improved term reduction and term weighting (2011) The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications, 18, pp. 131-135; Debole, F., Sebastiani, F., Supervised term weighting for automated text categorization (2004) Text Mining and Its Applications, pp. 81-97. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Ramasundaram, S., Victor, S.P., Text categorization by backpropagation network (2010) International Journal of Computer Applications, 8 (6), pp. 1-5",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2014 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development, SCOReD 2014",16 December 2014 through 17 December 2014,,111760,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"IEEE Stud.

Turbo Similarity Searching (TSS) and data fusion are two of the latest chemical similarity searching strategies, which has evolved from the conventional similarity searching (SS) that apply the concept of multi-target searching instead of just an individual target search. The indirect relationship exists in TSS, with the inclusion of Nearest Neighbours (NN) has been proven to have better performance than the direct relationship (i.e. between query structure and database structures) that exists in similarity searching process. In this paper, we will focus on the implementation and improvement of the existing TSS. By adding in another layer of indirect relationship between the reference compound and the database compounds, along with an additional fusion layer, the performance of the new TSS strategy can be observed. The initial results indicated that there is an obvious increment in the recall value when applying the new strategy. The results are also evaluated with the significance test to show that the result produced by the new strategy is true and does not occurred by chance. Further work on different activity classes and different descriptors on the new strategy are expected to generate a better performance than the existing TSS. © 2013 IEEE.",,Computer science; Data fusion; Information systems; Better performance; Chemical similarity; Database structures; Drug discovery process; Reference compounds; Significance test; Similarity Searching; Virtual Screening; Query processing,,,,,,,,"Brown, N., Chemoinformatics: An introduction for computer scientists (2009) ACM Comput.

However, not all kind of technologies are practical as the current infrastructure might not support the new technology or the prospective users might not afford price of the technology. Thus the matching between the target users and the appropriate level of technology to be provided is vitally important in order for the technology to be actually utilized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the current communication infrastructure of the rice farming community in Malaysia, in order to identify the potential of applying new information and communication methods in the agricultural community. The findings of this study indicate that Short Message Service (SMS) is the most cost effective and practical method to disseminate information to the farming community at this point of time. However, if other communication channels such as Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and mobile Internet become widely supported by the target users' devices, they have great potential to replace the SMS method. © 2012 AICIT.",argriculture technology; communication; Information Technology; mobile technology; rice farming,Communication infrastructure; Communication problems; Cost effective; Information and communication; Information and Communication Technologies; Malaysia; Mobile Internet; Mobile Technology; Multimedia messaging service; Practical method; rice farming; Short message services; Agriculture; Communication; Developing countries; Information dissemination; Information management; Information technology,,,,,,,,"Man, N., Sadiya, I., Off-Farm Employment Participation among Paddy Farmers in the Muda Agricultural Development Authority and Kemasin Semerak Granary Areas of Malaysia (2009) Asia-Pacific Development Journal, 16 (2), pp. 141-153; Grimshaw, D.J., Kala, S., (2011) Strengthening Rural Livelihoods: The Impacts of Information and Communication Technologies in Asia, , Warwickshire: Practical Action Publishing; V Biljon, J., Kotz, P., Modelling the factors that influence mobile phone adoption Proceedings of the 2007 Annual Research Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT Research in Developing Countries, Port Elizabeth, South Africa, 2007, , presented at the; May, H., Hearn, G., The mobile phone as media (2005) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 8, pp. 195-211. , June 1, 2005; (2007) Featuring the Handphone Users Survey, 3. , Cyberjaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan: Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission; Wang, M., Possible adoption of precision agriculture for developing countries at the threshold of the new millennium (2001) Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 30 (1-3), pp. 45-50; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies (1997) Decision SCiences, 28 (3), pp. 557-582; Plouffe, C.R., Hulland, J., Vandenbosch, M., Research Report: Richness Versus Parsimony in Modeling Technology Adoption Decisions -Understanding Merchant Adoption of a Smart Card-Based Payment System (2001) Information Systems Research, 12 (2), pp. 208-222; Compeau, D.R., Higgins, C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test (1995) MIS Quarterly, 19, pp. 189-212; Manstead, A.S., Van Eekelen, S.A., Distinguishing between Perceived Behavioral Control and Self-Efficacy in the Domain of Academic Achievement Intentions and Behaviors (1998) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 28 (15), pp. 1375-1392","Shiang-Yen, T.; School of Computer Sciences, , Penang, Malaysia; email: tsy09_com036@student.usm.my",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE);Inst.

This paper tests the correctness of this assumption. Results: Sets of 25 searches using either the same reference structure and 25 different similarity measures (similarity fusion) or 25 different reference structures and the same similarity measure (group fusion) show that large numbers of unique molecules are retrieved by just a single search, but that the numbers of unique molecules decrease very rapidly as more searches are considered. This rapid decrease is accompanied by a rapid increase in the fraction of those retrieved molecules that are active. There is an approximately log-log relationship between the numbers of different molecules retrieved and the number of searches carried out, and a rationale for this power-law behaviour is provided. Conclusions: Using multiple searches provides a simple way of increasing the precision of a similarity search, and thus provides a justification for the use of data fusion methods in virtual screening. © 2011 Holliday et al; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.",,,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 254562",,,"Oprea, T.I., Matter, H., Integrating virtual screening in lead discovery (2004) Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, 8 (4), pp. 349-358. , DOI 10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.06.008, PII S1367593104000845; Alvarez, J., Shoichet, B., (2005) Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery, , Boca Raton: CRC Press; Rippenhausen, P., Nisius, B., Peltason, L., Bajorath, J., Quo vadis, virtual screening?

This paper describes two techniques for enhancing the effectiveness of screening: the use of a second-level search based on the nearest neighbours of the initial reference structure; and the use of weighted fingerprints encoding the frequency of occurrence, rather than just the mere presence, of substructures. Experiments using several databases for which both structural and bioactivity data are available demonstrate the effectiveness of these two approaches. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",Chemoinformatics; Fingerprint; Fragment substructure; Similarity measure; Similarity searching; Turbo similarity searching; Virtual screening; Weighting scheme,Chemoinformatics; Fingerprint; Fragment substructure; Similarity measure; Similarity searching; Turbo similarity searching; Virtual screening; Weighting scheme; Drug products plants; Encoding (symbols); Pattern recognition; Bioinformatics,,,,,,,,"Stahura, F.L., Bajorath, J., Virtual Screening Methods That Complement High-Throughput Screening (2004) Combin.

A previous paper suggested that the approach was highly effective in operation; this paper further tests the approach using a range of different databases and of structural representations. Searches were carried out on three different databases of chemical structures, using seven different types of fingerprints, as well as molecular holograms, physicochemical properties, topological indices and reduced graphs. The results show that turbo similarity searching can indeed enhance retrieval but that this is normally achieved only if the similarity search that acts as its starting point has already achieved at least some reasonable level of search effectiveness. In other cases, a modified version of TSS that uses the nearest-neighbor information for approximate machine learning can be used effectively. Though useful for qualitative (active/inactive) predictions of biological activity, turbo similarity searching does not appear to exhibit any predictive power when quantitative property data is available. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Chemical database; Chemoinformatics; Similar property principle; Similarity searching; Turbo similarity searching,Biological activities; Chemical database; Chemical similarity; Chemical structure; Chemoinformatics; Data sets; Machine-learning; Molecular holograms; Nearest-neighbors; Physicochemical property; Predictive power; Property data; Screening performance; Similarity search; Similarity Searching; Structural representation; Topological index; Virtual Screening; Database systems,,,,,,,,"Willett, P., From chemical documentation to chemoinformatics: fifty years of chemical information science (2008) J Inf Sci, 34, pp. 477-499; (2000) Chemoinformatics: A Textbook, Weinheim, , J.
