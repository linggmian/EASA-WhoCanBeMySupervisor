At a more fine-grained level, aspect-based sentiment analysis focuses on the targets of users’ opinions and determining sentiment orientation of these opinions. Among different tasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis, aspect extraction is the key task which includes extraction of both explicit and implicit aspects. Due to the complexity of implicit aspects, not much effort has been put forward to solve the problem while explicit aspects have been studied extensively in the recent past. Existing approaches for implicit aspect extraction have focused on specific type of aspects and have neglected the actual problem. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a multi-level approach which identifies implicit aspects using co-occurrence and similarity-based techniques. This research focuses on the extraction of clues for implicit targets of users’ opinions and identification of true targets of users’ opinions with the help of implicit aspect clues. The proposed approach is divided into two phases: first, several rules are crafted to identify clues for implicit aspects in a review sentence. Secondly, aspects are assigned on the basis of extracted clues using proposed multi-level approach. The proposed model can extract not only implicit aspect clues associated with opinion words but also allocate clues to opinion words where no association is identified. This helps to identify implicit aspects with or without co-occurrences of opinion words with explicit aspects. Experimental evaluation elaborates the importance of implicit aspect clues in the identification of targets of users’ opinions. The proposed approach shows better results as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for the identification of implicit targets of users’ opinions on a dataset of different product reviews. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Co-occurrences; IAC; Implicit aspect extraction; Multi-level knowledge-based approach; NGD","Knowledge based systems; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Aspect identifications; Experimental evaluation; Knowledge-based approach; NAtural language processing; Product reviews; State-of-the-art approach; Subjective information; Systematic identification; Extraction",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/PKOMP/8014002","The authors wish to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for funding this research through the Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/8014002).",,"Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 5, pp. 1-167; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2, pp. 1-135; Rana, T.A., Cheah, Y.-N., Aspect extraction in sentiment analysis: comparative analysis and survey (2016) Artif Intell Rev, 46, pp. 459-483; Rana, T.A., Cheah, Y.-N., Letchmunan, S., Topic modeling in sentiment analysis: a systematic review (2016) Journal of ICT Research and Applications, 10, pp. 76-93; Hu, M., Liu, B., Mining and summarizing customer reviews (2004) Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

We experimented with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn sentiment polarity (positive or negative) from labeled data available in many different source domains and test its performance on a target domain that it is not trained on. Extensive experiments were conducted on 14 different domains using Amazon product reviews. Our preliminary findings show that cross-domain CNN models trained with multiple source domains achieved accuracy of above 80% across all the domains and outperform the in-domain models trained using limited labeled data from the same domain. In fact, the cross-domain CNN models demonstrated better performance when a larger number of source domains are used for training. Therefore, going deep and big is a promising direction to explore for cross-domain sentiment classification. © 2020 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; cross-domain sentiment classification; deep learning; product reviews; sentiment analysis","Convolution; Labeled data; Sentiment analysis; Different domains; Multiple domains; Multiple source; Number of sources; Product reviews; Sentiment classification; Target domain; Training data; Convolutional neural networks",,,,,"203/PKOMP/67711796

The current system causes massive workloads on nurses declining their efficiency in the workplace. Therefore, this study proposes an SMS-based vaccination reminder and management system called Virtual Health Connect (VHC) to assist the health centers by simplifying the management of infants’ immunization records. This study aims to realize influential factors of intention to use VHC among Malaysian health centers by considering the technology acceptance model (TAM) as an underlying theory. The proposed model will be verified using data collected from self-directed questionnaires answered by nurses working in Malaysian government hospitals and government clinics. A research method based on the multi-analytical approach of Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) will refine the results of this research. This study will contribute to the theoretical body of knowledge about influential factors of health centers’ intention to use VHC in Malaysian government health centers by extending the TAM model by adding new variables.

This is the most important task of aspect-based sentiment analysis as without the aspects, there is no much use of extracted opinions. Recent approaches have shown the significance of dependency-based rules for the given task. These rules are heavily dependent on the dependency parser and generated with the help of grammatical rules. In this article, we are proposing to learn from user’s behaviour to identify the relation among aspects and opinions. The use of sequential patterns has been proposed for the extraction of aspects. The key purpose of this research is to study the impact of sequential pattern mining in the phase of aspect extraction. Our experimental results show that the approach proposed in our work produced better results as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. © The Author(s) 2018.","aspect extraction; Aspect-based sentiment analysis;

These opinions serve as an important piece of knowledge for other reviewers. To figure out what the opinions is all about, an automatic system of analysis is needed. Aspect-based sentiment analysis is the most important research topic conducted to extract reviewers-opinions about certain attribute, for instance opinion-target (aspect). In aspect-based tasks, the identification of the implicit aspect such as aspects implicitly implied in a review, is the most challenging task to accomplish. However, this paper strives to identify the implicit aspects based on hierarchical algorithm incorporated with common-sense knowledge by means of dimensionality reduction. © 2018 IEEE.","analogy-based; aspect aggregation; HDP; implicit aspect extraction; online reviews; topic modeling","Data mining; Dimensionality reduction; Sentiment analysis; analogy-based; Automatic systems; Commonsense knowledge; Hierarchical algorithm; Online reviews; Opinion targets; Research topics; Topic Modeling; Image processing",,,,,,,,"Liu, B., (2017) Many Facets of Sentiment Analysis, pp. 11-39. , Springer, Cham; Medelyan, O., Milne, D., Legg, C., Witten, I.H., Mining meaning from Wikipedia (2009) Int.

To the best of the researchers' knowledge, nostudies have tested samples of text with letter repetition usingsentiment tools. The main aim of this paper is to investigatewhether letter repetition in product reviews are perceived tohave any sentiment value, based on ratings by individualparticipants and analyses using sentiment tools. This studycollected and analysed 1,041 consumer reviews in the form ofonline comments using the UCREL Wmatrix system, andsimulated emotional words within the comments to containrepeated letters. A group of 500 participants rated 15 positivecomments and 15 negative comments and their respectivesimulated counterparts, while 32 sentiment tools are used toanalyse a pair of positive comment and its simulated counterpartand a pair of negative comment and its simulated counterpart.Results indicate that readers perceive letter repetition to amplifya comment's sentiment value, in which the effect was foundmore strongly in negative comments than positive comments.On the other hand, analyses using sentiment tools show that amajority of these tools are unable to detect letter repetitionwithin a word and instead, treats the word as a spelling mistake.As consumers or online users, in general, have been found to useletter repetition to intensify and express their sentiments in theircomments, this study's findings suggest that letter repetitionprocessing in any text-based mechanism needs to be enhanced.The outcome of this paper is useful for improving themeasurement of sentiment analysis for the use of marketingapplications. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

A large number of approaches have been proposed to accomplish this task. These approaches identify a huge amount of potential aspects from customer reviews. But not all the extracted aspects are interesting and include terms which are not related to the product and these irrelevant terms affect the performance of the aspect extraction approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we are proposing a two-level aspect pruning approach to eliminate irrelevant aspects. The proposed approach performs the task of aspect pruning in two steps: (a) by calculating the frequency of each word and selecting the most frequent aspects; and (b) by calculating the semantic similarity of non-frequent words and eliminate aspects which are not semantically related to the product. Our experimental evaluation has shown a significant improvement of the proposed approach over the compared approaches. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Aspect pruning; Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Explicit aspects; Opinion mining","Data mining; Extraction; Semantics; Aspect pruning; Customer review; Experimental evaluation; Explicit aspects; Opinion mining; Semantic similarity; Sentiment analysis; Natural language processing systems",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Toqir A.

This task focuses on the identification of the targets of user's opinions or sentiments from online reviews. In the recent years, syntactic patterns-based approaches have performed quite well and produced significant improvement in the aspect extraction task. However, these approaches are heavily dependent on the dependency parsers which produced syntactic relations following the grammatical rules and language constraints. In contemporary, users do not give much importance to these rules and constraints while expressing their opinions about particular product and neither reviewer websites restrict users to do so. This makes syntactic patterns-based approaches vulnerable. Therefore, in this paper, we are proposing a two-fold rules-based model (TF-RBM) which uses rules defined on the basis of sequential patterns mined from customer reviews. The first fold extracts aspects associated with domain independent opinions and the second fold extracts aspects associated with domain dependent opinions. We have also applied frequency- and similarity-based approaches to improve the aspect extraction accuracy of the proposed model. Our experimental evaluation has shown better results as compared with the state-of-the-art and most recent approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aspect extraction; Aspect pruning; Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Explicit aspects; Opinion mining; Sequential pattern-based rules","Data mining; Extraction; Aspect pruning; Explicit aspects; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Sequential patterns; Syntactics",,,,,,,,"Agraval, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large data bases (1994) Proceedings of the 20th international conference on very large databases, VLDB, 1215, pp. 487-499; Bagheri, A., Saraee, M., De Jong, F., An unsupervised aspect detection model for sentiment analysis of reviews (2013) Natural language processing and information systems, pp. 140-151. , Springer; Bagheri, A., Saraee, M., De Jong, F., ADM-LDA: An aspect detection model based on topic modeling using the structure of review sentences (2014) Journal of Information Science, 40 (5), pp. 621-636; Bancken, W., Alfarone, D., Davis, J., Automatically detecting and rating product aspects from textual customer reviews (2014) Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on interactions between data mining and natural language processing at ECML/PKDD, pp. 1-16; Brody, S., Elhadad, N., An unsupervised aspect-sentiment model for online reviews (2010) Human language technologies: The 2010 annual conference of the North American chapter of the association for computational linguistics, pp. 804-812. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Cambria, E., Affective computing and sentiment analysis (2016) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 31 (2), pp. 102-107; Cambria, E., Poria, S., Bajpai, R., Schuller, B., SenticNet 4: A semantic resource for sentiment analysis based on conceptual primitives (2016) COLING, pp. 2666-2677; Chen, L., Qi, L., Wang, F., Comparison of feature-level learning methods for mining online consumer reviews (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (10), pp. 9588-9601; Chen, Z., Liu, B., Mining topics in documents: Standing on the shoulders of big data (2014) Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 1116-1125. , ACM; Chen, Z., Liu, B., Topic modeling using topics from many domains, lifelong learning and big data (2014) Proceedings of the 31st international conference on machine learning (ICML-14), pp. 703-711; Chen, Z., Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Aspect extraction with automated prior knowledge learning (2014) Proceedings of ACL, pp. 347-358; Chen, Z., Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Hsu, M., Castellanos, M., Ghosh, R., Exploiting domain knowledge in aspect extraction (2013) EMNLP, pp. 1655-1667; Choi, Y., Cardie, C., Hierarchical sequential learning for extracting opinions and their attributes (2010) Proceedings of the ACL 2010 conference short papers, pp. 269-274. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Cilibrasi, R.L., Vitanyi, P.M., The Google similarity distance (2007) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 19 (3), pp. 370-383; Cohen, A., (2015), http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com, FuzzyWuzzy: Fuzzy string matching in python.

A fold refers to the combination of training data subset and test data subset splits for training and validating machine learning models. Every fold would yield a certain accuracy value for the model. In the case of 10 fold cross validation, the overall accuracy is estimated by averaging the accuracy values produced by all 10 folds. For any dataset which contains a certain number of instances, there are many possible combinations of train-test data splits that could be generated. This implies that the train-test splitting process in cross validation can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. The set of all possible train-test splits for a dataset form an evolutionary search space. In existing works, genetic algorithm based feature selection formulates the problem of feature subset selection as a combinatorial optimization problem. The objective of those works is to identify the most optimal feature subset which yields the best model accuracy. Apart from feature subsets, train-test splits or folds also influence model accuracy. Using different folds for training a model would result in varying ranges of accuracy. Out of all possible folds in the search space, a specific set of folds could yield optimal accuracy just like in the case of genetic algorithm based feature subset selection. This work proposes an evolutionary cross validation algorithm for identifying optimal folds in a dataset to improve predictive modeling accuracy. Results of experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets suggest that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvement against the baseline 10 fold cross validation. © 2017 IEEE.","Cross Validation; Evolutionary Computation; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning","Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Set theory; Statistical tests; Testing; 10-fold cross-validation; Combinatorial optimization problems; Cross validation; Cross validation algorithms; Cross-validation methods; Experimental evaluation; Feature subset selection; Machine learning models; Evolutionary algorithms",,,,,,,,"Refaeilzadeh, P., Tang, L., Liu, H., Cross validation (2009) Encyclopedia of Database Systems, pp. 532-538; Kohavi, R., A study of cross-validation and bootstrap for accuracy estimation and model selection (1995) Proc.

This task aims to extract fine-grained aspects from online customer reviews, which is a challenging task. Most of the early work focused on the extraction of subjective aspects associated with some opinion words but very few have focused on objective aspects. These objective aspects can affect the overall performance of the aspect extraction task resulting in wrong results. In this paper, we proposed a sequential pattern-based approach to detect such aspects which are objective in nature. We defined several sequential patterns, on the basis of word occurrence in a sentence, to detect objective aspects. The experimental evaluation demonstrated significant improvement in the aspect extraction phase by pruning such aspects which are objective in nature. © 2016 IEEE.","aspect pruning; aspect-based sentiment analysis; objective aspects; sequential patterns","Data mining; Feature extraction; Natural language processing systems; aspect pruning; Experimental evaluation; Extraction phase; objective aspects; Online customer reviews; Sentiment analysis; Sequential patterns; Subjective aspects; Extraction",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","The authors would like to thank the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting the publication of this paper.

The proposed measures adopt the shortest path between synsets in WordNet as the core to measure the relatedness between two sentences. The interlinked synsets in WordNet are based on the conceptual-semantic relation between two synsets. Thus the distance between two synsets in WordNet can be used to measure the semantic relatedness between two synsets. This study derived a sentence-level semantic relatedness using this feature to detect paraphrasing among sentences. The performance of the proposed semantic relatedness in paraphrasing is evaluated based on the accuracy and F-measures of the proposed measures in identifying paraphrase in Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus. The proposed method achieved 71.1% in accuracy and 81.8% in F-measures. The performance of the proposed method is compared with 6 paraphrase detection methods which include Salient Semantic Analysis and Second-order Co-occurrence Pointwise Mutual Information. In the comparison, the proposed method achieved the fourth highest accuracy and the second highest F-measure compare to other methods. This is a reasonable performance for the proposed semantic relatedness in paraphrase detection. © 2016 IEEE.","paraphrase detection; semantic relatedness; synset shortest path; WordNet","Graph theory; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Microsoft researches; Paraphrase corpus; Pointwise mutual information; Semantic analysis; Semantic relatedness; Semantic relations; Shortest path; Wordnet; Semantics",,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia

SA deals with the computational treatment or the classification of user’s sentiments, opinions and emotions hidden within the text. Aspect extraction is the most vital and extensively explored phase of SA to carry out the classification of sentiments in precise manners. During the last decade, enormous number of research has focused on identifying and extracting aspects. Therefore, in this survey, a comprehensive overview has been attempted for different aspect extraction techniques and approaches. These techniques have been categorized in accordance with the adopted approach. Despite being a traditional survey, a comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted among different approaches of aspect extraction, which not only elaborates the performance of any technique but also guides the reader to compare the accuracy with other state-of-the-art and most recent approaches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aspect extraction; Aspect-level sentiment analysis; Explicit aspect; Implicit aspect","Extraction; Natural language processing systems; Sentiment analysis; Surveys; Text processing; Comparative analysis; Explicit aspect; Extraction techniques; Implicit aspect; State of the art; Text mining; World wide webs (WWW); Data mining",,,,,,,,"Agraval, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large data bases.

In automated planning research, the word ""plans"" refers specifically to plans of action. It is about the representation of future behavior, generally a series of action, with temporal and other constraints on them for execution by some agents. Theoretically, planning is an important part of rational behavior. In this study, we review some of the studies that have been conducted in menu planning. It covers the introduction of menu planning, the state of the arts for nutrition care expert systems and the approaches that have been applied. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of the methods commonly used for menu planning are also highlighted in this study. © 2016 Hea Choon Ngo, Yu-N Cheah, Ong Sing Goh, Yun-Huoy Choo, Halizah Basiron and Yogan Jaya Kumar.","Agents; Automated planning; Constraints; Menu planning; Nutrition care expert systems",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A.M., Earle, M.D., Diet planning in the third world by linear and goal programming (1983) J.

Text mining is an interdisciplinary field which depends on information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, parameter statistics and computational linguistics. Standard text mining and retrieval information techniques of text document usually rely on similar categories. An alternative method of retrieving information is clustering documents to preprocess text. The preprocessing steps have a huge effect on the success to extract knowledge. This study implements TF-IDF and singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensionality reduction techniques. The proposed system presents an effective preprocessing and dimensionality reduction techniques which help the document clustering by using k-means algorithm. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the performance of English text document clustering. Simulation results on BBC news and BBC sport datasets show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","clustering; clustering; dimension reduction; k-means; retrieval information; singular value decomposition; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Reduction; Singular value decomposition; Text processing; clustering; Dimension reduction; K-means; retrieval information; Text mining; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Wong, M.K., Abidi, S.S.R., Jonsen, D., A multi-phase correlation search framework for mining non-taxonomic relations from unstructured text (2014) Knowledge and Information Systems, 38 (3), pp. 641-667; Han, J., Kamber, M., (2006) Data Mining, Southeast Asia Edition: Concepts and Techniques, , Morgan kaufmann; Larose, D.T., (2014) Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining, , John Wiley & Sons; Ahmad, R., Khanum, A., Document topic generation in text mining by using cluster analysis with EROCK (2008) International Journal of Computer Science & Security (IJCSS), 4 (2), p. 176; Karypis, G., Han, E.H., Kumar, V., Chameleon: Hierarchical clustering using dynamic modeling (1999) Computer, 32 (8), pp. 68-75; Zhang, T., Ramakrishnan, R., Livny, M., BIRCH: An efficient data clustering method for very large databases (1996) ACM SIGMOD Record, 25 (2); Ramasundaram, S., Victor, S.P., Text categorization by backpropagation network (2010) International Journal of Computer Applications, 8, pp. 1-5; Banchs, R.E., (2012) Text Mining with MATLAB, , Springe",,"Al-Dabass D.Saad I.Mohamad K.A.Hijazi M.H.A.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology, ICAIET 2014","2 December 2014 through 5 December 2014",,118813,,9781479979103,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Companies ask their customers to review products and services offered by them over their websites. For the big companies, the number of reviews could be in the thousands. So it is almost impossible for any company to read these reviews manually and find out whether customers liked their product or not. Many techniques have been proposed for sentiment classification of reviews. In this paper we are proposing rulebased hybrid approach which exploits sequential patterns and normalized Google distance (NGD) to extract explicit as well as implicit aspects.

It presents the initial See What You Want, Feel What You See (SeeWYW, FeelWYS) framework that takes into account hybrid recommendation strategies with hybrid reasoning techniques. This framework has been developed to adapt to different user profiles and changeable contextual information, such as emotion. As the intention is on preparing an interactive tool for a student-centric field trip plan, this initial study focuses on recommending a visiting route through a virtual museum by using image-based virtual tour. It is hoped that this framework will guide the quest to incorporate the positive elements presented by a previous work on image recommender systems that may expectantly produce good system usability and user acceptance, as well as let the students learn and enjoy their knowledge. © 2013 IEEE.","reasoning technique for education; Recommend-Re-recommend Framework; recommendation strategies; virtual museum tour guides","Contextual information; Hybrid recommendation; Hybrid strategies; Image recommender system; Reasoning techniques; Recommend-Re-recommend Framework; Recommendation strategies; Virtual museum tours; Recommender systems",,,,,,,,"Liang, T.P., Yang, Y.F., Chen, D.N., Ku, Y.C., A semantic-expansion approach to personalized knowledge recommendation (2008) Decision Support Systems, 45 (3), pp. 401-412; Van Hage, W.R., Stash, N., Wang, Y., Aroyo, L., Finding your way through the rijkmuseum with an adaptive mobile guide (2010) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6088, pp. 46-59; Nunes, M.A.S.N., Towards to psychological-based recommenders systems: A survey on recommender systems (2010) Scientia Plena, 6; Buder, J., Schwind, C., Learning with personalized recommender systems: A psychological view (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28, pp. 207-216; Balabanovic, M., Shoham, Y., Fab: Content-based, collaborative recommendation (1997) Comm.

Therefore, feature extraction (FE) plays a vital role in topic classification in particular and text mining in general. FE based on cosine similarity score is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of features, which can be impossible to process further. In this study, TF-IDF term weighting is used to extract features. Selecting relevant features and determining how to encode them for a learning machine method have a vast impact on the learning machine methods ability to extract a good model. Two different weighting methods (TF-IDF and TF-IDF Global) were used and tested on the Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection. The obtained results emerged a good candidate for enhancing the performance of English topics FE. Simulation results the Reuters-21578 text categorization show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","cosine similarity score; feature extraction; TF-IDF weighting; topic classification","Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Text processing; Cosine similarity; High dimensionality; Learning machines; Relevant features; Text categorization; TF-IDF weighting; Topic Classification; Weighting methods; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Ayache, S., Quénot, G., Gensel, J., (2007) Classifier Fusion for SVM-based Multimedia Semantic Indexing, pp. 494-504. , Springer: Berlin-Heidelberg; Sadiq, A.T., Abdullah, S.M., Hybrid intelligent technique for text categorization (2012) IEEE, pp. 238-245; Benfriha, H., Barigou, F., Atmani, B., (2013) Lattice-cell: Hybrid Approach for Text Categorization, pp. 1311-4151. , arXiv preprint arXiv; Metzler, D., Dumais, S., Meek, C., (2007) Similarity Measures for Short Segments of Text., pp. 6-27. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Forman, G., An extensive empirical study of feature selection metrics for text classification (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning, 3, pp. 1289-1305; Soucy, P., Mineau, G.W., Beyond TFIDF weighting for text categorization in the vector space model (2005) IJCAI, 5, pp. 1130-1135; Turney, P.D., Pantel, P., From frequency to meaning: Vector space models of semantics (2010) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 37 (1), pp. 141-188; Ikonomakis, M., Kotsiantis, S., Tampakas, V., Text classification using machine learning techniques (2005) WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 4 (8), pp. 966-974; Kamruzzaman, S.M., Haider, F., (2010) A Hybrid Learning Algorithm for Text Classification, pp. 1009-4574. , arXiv preprint arXiv; Shi, K., Efficient text classification method based on improved term reduction and term weighting (2011) The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications, 18, pp. 131-135; Debole, F., Sebastiani, F., Supervised term weighting for automated text categorization (2004) Text Mining and Its Applications, pp. 81-97. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Ramasundaram, S., Victor, S.P., Text categorization by backpropagation network (2010) International Journal of Computer Applications, 8 (6), pp. 1-5",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2014 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development, SCOReD 2014","16 December 2014 through 17 December 2014",,111760,,9781479964284,,,"English","IEEE Stud.

Specifically, the Modified micro Genetic Algorithm (MmGA) is used to form the ensemble optimizer. The aim of the MmGA-based ensemble optimizer is two-fold, i.e. to select a small number of input features for classification and to improve the classification performances of neural network models. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a number of benchmark problems are first used, and the results are compared with those from other methods. The applicability of the proposed system to a human motion detection and classification task is then evaluated. The outcome positively demonstrates that the proposed MmGA-based ensemble optimizer is able to improve the classification performances of neural network models with a smaller number of input features. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble models; Evolutionary algorithm; Feature selection; Multi-objective optimization; Neural network classifiers","Classification performance; Classification tasks; Ensemble models; Feature selection and classification; Human motion detection; Micro genetic algorithm; Multi-objective evolutionary; Neural network classifier; Feature extraction; Multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; accelerometer; adult; article; artificial neural network; child; classification; classifier; evolutionary algorithm; feature selection; human; human experiment; information processing; machine learning; modified micro genetic algorithm; priority journal; process optimization; quality control",,,,,,,,"Langley, P., Simon, H.A., Applications of machine learning and rule induction (1995) Commun.

Once it is on production the software application must evolve when new anomalies uncovered or when new user requirement arises. Prior to any software evolution, decision making need to be undertaken by the organization's Software Maintenance Decision Maker (SMDM) whether to proceed with the evolution required and how to proceed with the required maintenance. However, the study on decision making in software maintenance is very limited. Existing researches focus mainly on project management, software effort estimation or decision making on software maintenance policy selection. The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of knowledge management method to capture the software maintenance knowledge of a software application that is inherent in the Software Application Expert Maintainer (SAEM) mind and software application specification and use it to support the software maintenance analysis phase. It is crucial for the knowledge to be available for the SMDM especially in the event that the expert software maintainer is not available. This study is also able to assist Software Application Beginner Maintainer (SABM) to gain maintenance knowledge of a particular software application that is available in the knowledge-based decision making model. This results in shorter time to learn on how to maintain a software application without the SAEM assistance. This paper proposes an alternative to the SAEM and software application specification knowledge through the Maintenance Decision Making Knowledge-Based (MademKB) Model that can preserve the maintenance knowledge of a software application to support software maintenance decision making. The MADEMKB is evaluated using case study with Malaysian organization. © 2014 IEEE.","decision making model; knowledge management; software maintenance","Application programs; Computer software maintenance; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Maintenance; Management science; Project management; Software engineering; Specifications; Decision making models; Knowledge-based decision making; Knowledge-based model; Maintenance decision making; Maintenance decisions; Maintenance policy selections; Software applications; Software effort estimation; Decision making",,,,,,,,"(2001) Software Engineering-Product Quality-Part 1: Quality Model"", , ISO.

This is due to the large number of unique words (or high dimensionality). Choosing semantic features instead could significantly reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This article describes the use of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for question classification based on semantic features to improve both the training and testing speeds compared to the benchmark Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Improvements have also been made to the head word extraction and word sense disambiguation processes. These have resulted in a higher accuracy (an increase of 0.2%) for the classification of coarse classes compared to the benchmark. For the fine classes, however, there is a 1.0% decrease in accuracy but is compensated by a significant increase in speed (92.1% on average). © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.","Extreme learning machine; Head word feature; Question classification; Semantic features; Statistical question classification",,,,,,,,,"Riloff, E., Mann, G., Phillips, W., Reverse-Engineering Question/Answer Collections from Ordinary Text (2006) Advances In Open Domain Question Answering, pp. 505-531. , T.

An NSGA-II inspired elitism strategy and a population initialization strategy are embedded into the traditional micro Genetic Algorithm (mGA) to form the proposed MmGA. The main aim of the MmGA is to improve its convergence rate towards the pareto optimal solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the MmGA, two experiments using the Kursawe test function in MOPs are conducted, and the results are compared with those from other approaches using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm indicator, i.e. the Generational Distance (GD). The outcomes positively demonstrate that the MmGA is able to provide useful solutions with improved GD measures for tackling MOPs. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

Once it is on production the information system must evolve due to the operating environment changes, when new anomalies uncovered or when new user requirement arises. Prior to any software evolution, decision-making need to be undertaken by the organization's IT decision makers whether to proceed with the evolution required, if yes on how to proceed with the required maintenance. However, the study on decision making in software maintenance is very limited, existing research focus mainly on project management. The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of knowledge engineering method to capture the software maintenance knowledge of an information system that is inherent in the software expert's mind, documentation and code. This uses the concept of expert system to record the knowledge of the information system in a knowledge base and inference logic to analyst the recorded knowledge. The analysis is carried out using heuristic and inference logic pre-programmed into the expert-based framework. This is crucial especially to assist IT decision makers in determining whether it is possible to incorporate an additional requirement into a running system within an acceptable timeframe without the presence of a software expert in question. The framework is tested by proof of concept with a real life application of an organization. © 2013 IEEE.","decision support; expert system; knowledge engineering; software maintenance","Computer circuits; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Information use; Knowledge engineering; Project management; Decision makers; Decision supports; Operating environment; Proof of concept; Real-life applications; Running systems; Software Evolution; User requirements; Decision making",,,,,,,,"IEEE Standard for Software Maintenance IEEE Std 1219-1998"", pp 1-45, June 2 1993; International Standard-ISO/IEC 14764 IEEE Std 14764-2006"" ISO/IEC 14764:2006 (E) IEEE Std 14764-2006 Revision of IEEE Std 1219-1998), 2006 1-46; Lawry, R., Waddell, D., Singh, M., Roles, responsibilities and futures of chief information officers (cios) in the public sector (2007) Proceedings of European and Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (EMCIS); Feigenbaum, E.A., McCorduck, P., (1983) The Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence & Japan's Computer Challenge to the World, , Addison Wesley Publishing Company; Soumitra, D., (1993) Knowledge Processing & Applied Artificial Intelligence, , England: Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd; Bjørnson, F.O., Dingsøyr, T., Knowledge management in software engineering: A systematic review of studied concepts, findings and research methods used (2008) Information and Software Technology, , Elsevier Ltd, 50; Ramsey, S.D., Ntuen, C.A., Satorc: A system analysis tool for reengineering complex systems (1997) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 33, pp. 179-183; I.

The team formation algorithm is designed in a way that it would continuously search for resources with better performance and pool resources together to achieve better availability. The main intention of this work is not to replace the human administrators but to provide a better alternative in managing services in dynamic distributed environment. Instructions from the administrators are still required but at a different level. Administrators are freed from making low level decisions such as to decide the actual placement of the services and design the failover capabilities for each of the services. The evaluation results showed that the framework is capable of managing resources according to the requirements given by administrator, even during in the event of multiple consecutive resources failure. The proposed solution had the probability of 72.1% of its services that are still available after 83.3% of the available resources were shut down while conventional failover solution using three redundant units had only the probability of 40.8% of services that are still available. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Having different ontologies to support different semantic web documents leads to the problem of ontology integration in a broader sense. This brings about the need for ontology mapping. The problem with current ontology mapping approaches is that they are only able to solve specific areas of ontology mapping. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on genetic algorithm that determines the best combination of algorithms to map the ontologies. A hybrid approach looks into different aspect of the ontology, resulting in an overall optimized ontology mapping result. © 2011 IEEE.","ontology mapping; semantic web","Fundamental building blocks; Hybrid approach; Ontology integration; Ontology mapping; Semantic web documents; Specific areas; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Mapping; Semantic Web; World Wide Web; Ontology",,,,,,,,"Huang, J., Dang, J., Vidal, J.M., Huhns, M.N., Ontology Matching Using an Artificial Neural Network to Learn Weights Proc.

As these software age, they have to be maintained to suit the demands of the users. There are many challenges involved in maintaining this software which decision makers in the software reengineering community have to address. These decision makers need an expert's assistance in reengineering the software. Many studies attempt to support decision makers. However, there is limited study in adopting artificial intelligence approaches to support the decision-making process. Hence, we introduce an expert-based decision support framework called REXDES that can analyze different components of a software application to facilitate decision-making in software reengineering. © 2011 IEEE.","decision makers; decision support; expert system; software reengineering","Decision makers; Decision making process; Decision supports; Expert-based decisions; Software applications; software reengineering; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Reengineering; Software engineering",,,,,,,,"John, M., David, C., Cheryl, J., Beth, L., Elizabeth, C., Jose, D., (2001) Practical Software Measurement: Objective Information for Decision Makers, , Addison-Wesley Professional; Vliet, H., (2008) Software Engineering Principles and Practice, , John Wiley & Sons, LTD; Pfleeger, S.L., (2001) Software Engineering Theory and Practice, , Prentice Hall International, Inc; Lawry, R., Waddell, D., Singh, M., Roles, responsibilities and futures of chief information officers (CIOS) in the public sector Proceedings of European and Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (EMCIS), 2007; Martel, R.J., Sudano, J.J., Information optimization for decision-making Aerospace and Electronics Conference, 1997.

The Dynamic Service Placement and Replication (DSPR) framework is designed to manage services on distributed environment by repetitively searching for the best combination of distributed machines from a resource pool until the best working group is attained to satisfy the requirements of the service. In this research, a fuzzy logic based resource evaluation technique is proposed for the DSPR framework. The proposed technique is then compared with existing resource evaluation methods such as rule-based, utility-based and constraint-based. Besides that, the ability of DSPR to increase service availability in the event of multiple continuous failures is measured. The performance difference between using DSPR and conventional system with failover capability in the event of disaster was carried out. These experiments justify the suitability of using the proposed resource evaluation techniques compare to the existing work. © 2011 IEEE.","dynamic service placement and replication; fuzzy logic; resource evaluation; service availability","Constraint-based; Conventional systems; Core components; Distributed environments; Dynamic services; Failover; Resource evaluation; Resource selection; Rule based; Service availability; Working groups; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,,,"Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Zaharia, M., A view of cloud computing Commun.

This paper presents a newly developed ontological approach in the form of a template for capturing lessons learned in new electronic products design projects. The developed template embodies a source-impact-action (SIA) triple that categorizes knowledge in key learning and knowledge areas. A case study using the structured SIA-based template was successfully piloted at Motorola Penang Design Centre. Results of the SIA triple and its associated benefits shall be presented. © 2011 IEEE.","Lessons learned; ontology; project management","Design projects; Electronic product; Free flow; Information gathering; Knowledge areas; Lessons learned; Motorola; Ontological approach; Program management; Design; Industrial engineering; Ontology; Project management",,,,,,,,"Nonaka, I., Takeuchi, H., (1995) The Knowledge Creating Company, , USA: Oxford University Press; Marlin, M., Implementing an effective lessons learned process in a global project environment (2008) PM World Today, 10 (11); Project Lessons Learned, , http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/project-lessons-learned- TC001144319.aspx, Retrieved: 7 February 2011; Andres, R., Lessons Learned Questions, , http://ryanendres.blogspot.com/2009/03/lesson-learned-questions.html, Retrieved: 7 February 2011; Weber, R., Aha, D.W., Becerra-Fernandez, I., Categorizing intelligent lessons learned systems (2000) Intelligent Lessons Learned Systems: Papers from the AAAI Workshop, pp. 94-100. , D.

In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art techniques that could improve service availability in distributed environments and propose an autonomic algorithm based on team building concept that dynamically performs service placement to improve service availability even in the event of resource failures. © 2010 IEEE.","Autonomic computing; Resource availability; Resource management; Service placement","Autonomic Computing; Distributed environments; Distributed systems; Dynamic services; Operation cost; Placement algorithm; Reliability and availability; Resource availability; Resource management; Service availability; Service performance; Service placement; Team building; Information technology; Lakes; Natural resources management; Quality assurance; Redundancy; Resource allocation; Algorithms",,,,,,,,"Kephart, J.O., Research challenges of autonomic computing (2005) Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, , ACM: St. Louis, MO, USA; Sterritt, R., Autonomic computing (2005) Innovations Systems Software Engineering, 1 (1), pp. 79-88; Samuel, K., Ramon, N., Jordi, T., Autonomic QoS-Aware resource management in grid computing using online performance models (2007) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools, , ICST (Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering): Nantes, France; Folino, G., Spezzano, G., An autonomic tool for building self-organizing Grid-enabled applications (2007) Future Gener.

This can be addressed by ontology mapping. Issues related to ontology mapping include the lack of efforts to hybridize the various ontology mapping algorithms that are available. Another problem concerns the mapping approaches themselves, i.e. these are either concept-based or instance-based (and not a combination of these). In this paper, we present an approach for ontology mapping. Our approach employs a library of ontology mapping algorithms. A number of these algorithms are selected and linked or hybrided to produce a composite algorithm. Furthermore, we also present a result aggregation engine which can either present results of the individual algorithms separately or fuse the results of the composite algorithm. © 2010 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Mapping; Ontology","Composite algorithm; Concept-based; Hybrid approach; Ontology mapping; Conformal mapping; Genetic algorithms; Information technology; Ontology",,,,,,,,"Jingshan, H., Jiangbo, D., Jose, M.V., Michael, N.H., Ontology matching using an artificial neural network to learn weights (2007) Proceedings IJCAI Workshop on Semantic Web for Collaborative Knowledge Acquisition (SWeCKa-07), , Hyderabad, India, January; Feiyu, L., (2007) State of the Art: Automatic Ontology Matching, , School of Engineering, Jönköping Universiy, Gjuterigatan 5, 551 11 Jönköping, Sweden.

Coalition formation is an approach dedicated to achieve optimal group arrangement. We are working in the direction of identifying strategies to build a coalition formation system taking into consideration the social factors. Computational cultural dynamics (CCD) is a research area that intertwines computer technology with behavioural and social sciences. We find that this research has potential to be further expanded to study and build a group setting. At the same time, the value of knowledge is seen as an important factor to determine the success of such coalition especially from the social aspect. Therefore, with the motivation to achieve a CCD perspective of a knowledge based coalition formation, social factors are studied, where the knowledge derived from this process will be identified, represented and stored. In this paper, we present a framework for the knowledge based coalition formation focusing on structuring the social factors chosen to initiate the knowledge process of the coalition formation system. © 2010 IEEE.","Coaltion formation; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social factors","Coalition formations; Coaltion formation; Collaborative teams; Computer technology; Knowledge process; Research areas; Social factor; Specific tasks; Information technology; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social aspects; Knowledge representation",,,,,,,,"Housel, T., Bell, A.H., (2001) Measuring and Managing Knowledge, , McGraw-Hill, Chapter 1; Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., (2001) Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, , 6th ed.

However, their effectiveness is limited in view that it is difficult to develop a knowledge discovery pipeline that is suited for all types of datasets. Moreover, it is difficult to select the best possible algorithm for each stage of the pipeline. In this paper, we define (a) a novel clustering ensemble algorithm based on self-organizing maps to automate the annotation of un-annotated medical datasets; (b) a data discretization algorithm based on Boolean Reasoning to discretize continuous data values; (c) a rule filtering mechanism; and (d) to extend the regular knowledge discovery process by including a learning mechanism based on neural network ensembles to produce a neural knowledge base for decision support. We believe that this would result in a decision support system that is tolerant towards ambiguous queries, e.g. with incomplete inputs. We also believe that the boosting and aggregating features of ensemble techniques would help to compensate for any shortcomings in some stages of the pipeline. Ultimately, we combine these efforts to produce an extended knowledge discovery pipeline.","Clustering ensemble; Discretization; Knowledge discovery; Neural network ensemble; Rough set analysis","Clustering Ensemble; Discretization; Knowledge Discovery; Neural network ensemble; Rough set analysis; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Industry; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Metadata; Pipelines; Rough set theory; Self organizing maps; Medical education",,,,,,,,"Abidi, S.S.R., Hoe, K.M., Symbolic exposition of medical data-sets: A data mining workbench to inductively derive data-defining symbolic rules (2002) Proceedings of the 15th IEEE Symposium on Computer Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002), , Maribor, Slovenia; Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Machine Learning, 24, pp. 123-140; Dimitriadou, E., Weingessel, A., Hornik, K., A cluster ensembles framework (2003) Design and Application of Hybrid Intelligent Systems.

Therefore, in this paper, we present a portable and intuitively easy plan representation that facilitates the storage and manipulation of generic plans for dynamic planning. Our plan ontology and representation also takes into account the possible application of planning in grid architectures and environments. Our plan ontology adopts and incorporates elements of current plan ontologies and representations, especially the Asbru plan ontology, and Goals-Operators-Methods-Selection (GOMS) analysis. It also maintains a hierarchical structuring of the plan ontology.

Data-mediated knowledge discovery, especially from multiple heterogeneous data resources, is a tedious process and imposes significant operational constraints on end-users. We demonstrate that autonomous, reactive and proactive intelligent agents provide an opportunity to generate end-user oriented, packaged, value-added decision-support/strategic planning services for professionals, managers and policy makers of an organization, without the need for a priori technical knowledge. Since effective progress of an organization is grounded in good communication, experience sharing, continuous learning and proactive actions, we present an Agent-based Data Mining Info-structure (ADMI) that deploys a suite of Data Mining (DM) algorithms coupled with intelligent agents to facilitate data access, DM query specification, DM algorithm selection and DM result visualisation - i.e. automated generation of data-mediated decision-support/strategic-planning services.","Agents; Data mining and Healthcare; Multiagent methodology; Multiagent systems","Computer architecture; Data mining; Decision support systems; Distributed database systems; Health care; Intelligent agents; Knowledge based systems; Strategic planning; Agent based data mining into-structure (ADMI); Knowledge sharing; Multiagent methodology; Multi agent systems",,,,,,,,"Abidi, S.S.R., Y-N, A convergence of knowledge management and data mining: Towards 'knopwledge driven' strategic services (2000) 3rd Int.

In this paper, we discuss a novel knowledge acquisition and representation strategy using healthcare scenarios. This strategy is complemented with an ontology- or thesaurus-based input standardization mechanism to limit the diverse nature of the healthcare experts’ input. We also present in detail an algorithm for healthcare knowledge crystallization that, in addition to simulating the process of annealing, employs the notion of nucleation and growth on healthcare knowledge. The crystallized knowledge potentially undergoes a repair process that employs analogical reasoning to identify less useful knowledge and transform them, with the aid of more established knowledge, into useful ones. We conclude by asserting that the strategies presented do provide an all-rounded approach in our efforts to bring quality healthcare knowledge and services to the masses. © 2001, Sage Publications.
