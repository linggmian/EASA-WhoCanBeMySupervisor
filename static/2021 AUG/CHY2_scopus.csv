Such elasticity reflects the fluctuation of resource provisioning due to the variety of service demands. Most high-demanding services adopt a multi-tier architecture. However, offering quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee for these services with least resource usage costs under dynamic and unpredictable workloads and different resource demands is a significantly complex problem. Therefore, cloud providers (CPs) need to adopt a dynamic resource optimization and provisioning framework. Numerous rule-based and model-based approaches have been designed for dynamic resource provisioning in virtualized data centers. However, these approaches mainly focus on providing service-level QoS guarantees for running services and most of them do not address mainly the problem of minimizing the number of running virtual machines in order to increase CP profit. This research proposes a new resource optimization and provisioning (ROP) framework to detect, solve the bottlenecks, and satisfy the service-level QoS requirements of running services and to increase the CP profits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ROP against other approaches, a prototype running on a cloud platform is developed, and a workload generator and multi-tier service model are adopted. Results show that the ROP framework outperforms other existing approaches by 75% in terms of on-demand service configurations while providing service-level QoS guarantee for running services. © 2017, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Case-based reasoning; Multi-tier cloud service; Quality of service; Resource management",,,,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia: 304/PKOMP/6313168","Acknowledgements This research has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under USM short-term Grant 304/PKOMP/6313168.","Ghetas, M., Yong, C.H., Sumari, P., A survey of quality of service in multi-tier web applications (2016) KSII Trans.

In MBO, there are mainly two processes. In the first process, the algorithm emulates how some of the butterflies move from the current position to the new position by the migration operator. In the latter process, the algorithm tunes the position of other butterflies by adjusting operator. In order to enhance the search ability of MBO, an innovation method called MBHS is introduced to tackle the optimization problem. In MBHS, the harmony search (HS) adds mutation operators to the process of adjusting operator to enhance the exploitation, exploration ability, and speed up the convergence rate of MBO. For the purpose to validate the performance of MBHS, 14 benchmark functions are used, and the performance is compared with well-known search algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MBHS performs better than the basic MBO and other algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.","butterfly optimization; Evolutionary computation; Harmony search","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Control systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Benchmark functions; Convergence rates; Harmony search; Innovation methods; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mutation operators; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Optimization",,,,,,,"Yang, X.-S., Firefly algorithm, stochastic test functions and design optimisation (2010) International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 2 (2), pp. 78-84; Michalewicz, Z., Fogel, D.B., (2013) How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics, , (Springer Science & Business Media, 2013); Van Laarhoven, P.J., Aarts, E.H., (1987) Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications, , (Springer Science & Business Media, 1987); Gandomi, A.H., Yang, X.-S., Alavi, A.H., Mixed variable structural optimization using firefly algorithm (2011) Computers & Structures, 89 (23), pp. 2325-2336; Sivanandam, S., Deepa, S., (2008) Genetic Algorithms: Introduction to Genetic Algorithms, pp. 15-37. , (Springer); Engelbrecht, A.P., (2006) Fundamentals of Computational Swarm Intelligence, , (John Wiley & Sons, 2006); Kennedy, J., (2010) Particle Swarm Optimization': 'Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, pp. 760-766. , (Springer); Ram, G., Mandal, D., Kar, R., Ghoshal, S.P., Optimal design of non-uniform circular antenna arrays using PSO with wavelet mutation (2014) International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 6 (6), pp. 424-433; Mirjalili, S., Wang, G.-G., Coelho, L.D.S., Binary optimization using hybrid particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (2014) Neural Computing and Applications, 25 (6), pp. 1423-1435; Wang, G.-G., Gandomi, A.H., Alavi, A.H., Deb, S., A hybrid method based on krill herd and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (2015) Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-18; Wang, G.-G., Hossein Gandomi, A., Yang, X.-S., Hossein Alavi, A., A novel improved accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm for global numerical optimization (2014) Engineering Computations, 31 (7), pp. 1198-1220; Simon, D., Biogeography-based optimization (2008) Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on, 12 (6), pp. 702-713; Saremi, S., Mirjalili, S., Lewis, A., Biogeography-based optimisation with chaos (2014) Neural Computing and Applications, 25 (5), pp. 1077-1097; Li, X., Yin, M., Multiobjective binary biogeography based optimization for feature selection using gene expression data (2013) NanoBioscience, IEEE Transactions on, 12 (4), pp. 343-353; Wang, G.-G., Gandomi, A.H., Alavi, A.H., An effective krill herd algorithm with migration operator in biogeographybased optimization (2014) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 38 (9), pp. 2454-2462; Wang, G., Guo, L., Duan, H., Wang, H., Liu, L., Shao, M., Hybridizing harmony search with biogeography based optimization for global numerical optimization (2013) Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience, 10 (10), pp. 2312-2322; Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Colorni, A., Ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents (1996) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 26 (1), pp. 29-41; Krynicki, K., Jaen, J., Mocholí, J.A., Ant colony optimisation for resource searching in dynamic peer-to-peer grids (2014) International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 6 (3), pp. 153-165; Khatib, W., Fleming, P.J., The stud GA: A mini revolution?

Most of these services use multi-tier architecture for flexible scaling and software reusability. However, managing the performance of multi-tier web services under dynamic and unpredictable workload, and different resource demands in each tier is a critical problem for a service provider. When offering quality of service assurance with least resource usage costs, web service providers should adopt self-adaptive resource provisioning in each tier. Recently, a number of rule- and model-based approaches have been designed for dynamic resource management in virtualized data centers. This survey investigates the challenges of resource provisioning and provides a competing assessment on the existing approaches. After the evaluation of their benefits and drawbacks, the new research direction to improve the efficiency of resource management and recommendations are introduced. © 2016 KSII.","Cloud computing; Multi-tier Application; Quality of service; Resource management","Client server computer systems; Cloud computing; Computer software reusability; Information management; Natural resources management; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Reusability; Surveys; Telecommunication services; Websites; Dynamic resource management; Model based approach; Multi tier architecture; Multi-tier applications; Quality of service assurances; Resource management; Virtualized data centers; Web service providers; Web services",,,,,,,"Douglas, Barry, K., (2003) Web Services, Service-Oriented Architectures, and Cloud Computing: The Savvy Manager's Guide, , Morgan Kaufmann Pub; Fielding, R.T., Kaiser, G., The Apache HTTP Server Project (1997) IEEE Internet Computing, 1 (4), pp. 88-90. , July, Article (CrossRef Link); Tomcat 6.0.44, , http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/; The Java Community Process Program, , http://jcp.org/en/introduction/overview; Menasc, D.A., Almeida, V.A.F., Dowdy Larry, W., (2002) Capacity Planning for Web Services: Metrics, Models, and Methods, , Prentice Hall PTR; Kleinrock, Leonard, (1976) Queuing Systems, 2. , Computer ApplicationsNY: Wiley; Chandra, A., Gong, W., Shenoy, P., Dynamic resource allocation for shared data centers using online measurements (2003) Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 381-398. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Article (CrossRef Link); Xiong, P., Wang, Z., Jung, G., Pu, C., Study on performance management and application behavior in virtualized environment (2010) Proc. of Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), 2010 IEEE, pp. 841-844. , Article (CrossRef Link); Urgaonkar, B., Pacifici, G., Shenoy, P., Spreitzer, M., Tantawi, A., An Analytical Model for Multi-Tier Internet Services and Its Applications (2005) Proc. of ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, 33, pp. 291-302. , Article (CrossRef Link); (2012), http://www.rackspace.com/; Wei, J., Cheng-Zhong, X., EQoS: Provisioning of client-perceived end-to-end QoS guarantees in web servers (2006) Computers, IEEE Transactions, 55 (12), pp. 1543-1556. , Article (CrossRef Link); Liu, X., Sha, L., Diao, Y., Froehlich, S., Hellerstein, J.L., Parekh, S., Online response time optimization of apache web server (2003) Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 461-478. , Article (CrossRef Link); Zhou, D., Huang, W.W., Using a fuzzy classification approach to assess e-commerce web sites: An empirical investigation (2009) ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), 9 (3), p. 12. , Article (CrossRef Link); Diao, Y., Hellerstein, J.L., Parekh, S., (2002) Optimizing quality of service using fuzzy controlManagement Technologies for E-Commerce and E-Business Applications, pp. 42-53. , Article (CrossRef Link); Lama, P., Zhou, X., Autonomic provisioning with self-adaptive neural fuzzy control for percentile-based delay guarantee (2013) ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), 8 (2), p. 9. , Article (CrossRef Link); Rao, J., Wei, Y., Gong, J., Cheng-Zhong, X., Qos guarantees and service differentiation for dynamic cloud applications (2013) Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions, 10 (1), pp. 43-55. , Article (CrossRef Link); Maurer, M., Brandic, I., Sakellariou, R., Self-adaptive and resource-efficient SLA enactment for cloud computing infrastructures (2012) Proc. of Cloud Computing (CLOUD), 2012 IEEE 5Th International Conference On, pp. 368-375. , Article (CrossRef Link); Lama, P., Zhou, X., Efficient server provisioning with control for end-to-end response time guarantee on multitier clusters (2012) Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions On, 23 (1), pp. 78-86. , Article (CrossRef Link); Wang, L., Jing, X., Zhao, M., Yicheng, T., Fortes, J.A.B., Fuzzy modeling based resource management for virtualized database systems (2011) Proc. of Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2011 IEEE 19Th International Symposium On, pp. 32-42. , Article (CrossRef Link); Martinez, J.F., Ipek, E., Dynamic multicore resource management: A machine learning approach (2009) Micro, IEEE, 29 (5), pp. 8-17. , Article (CrossRef Link); Tesauro, G., Jong, N.K., Das, R., Bennani, M.N., A hybrid reinforcement learning approach to autonomic resource allocation (2006) Proc. of Autonomic Computing, 2006.

In the Hybrid algorithm, the number of messages needed for request and release operations which refer to the response time will be decreased, and the bandwidth consumption for these operations in the network will be decreased as well, by eliminating the useless consumption in the Ring algorithm and decreasing it in Multicast algorithm.

It discusses the characteristics of classical authorization system and requirements of the authorization system in pervasive grid environment as well. Based on our analysis of current systems and taking into account the main requirements of such pervasive environment, we propose new authorization system architecture as an extension of the existing grid authorization mechanisms. This architecture not only supports user attributes but also context attributes which act as a key concept for context-awareness thought. The architecture allows authorization of users dynamically when there are changes in the pervasive grid environment. For this, we opt for hybrid authorization method that integrates push and pull mechanisms to combine the existing grid authorization attributes with dynamic context assertions. We will investigate the proposed architecture using a real testing environment that includes heterogeneous pervasive grid infrastructures mapped over multiple virtual organizations. Various scenarios are described in the last section of the article to strengthen the proposed mechanism with different facilities for the authorization procedure.","Authorization System; Contextawareness; Pervasive Grid; Ubiquity","Authorization procedure; Authorization systems; Context attributes; Context-Aware; Context-awareness; Dynamic contexts; Pervasive environments; Pervasive grid computing; Pervasive grids; Proposed architectures; Testing environment; Ubiquity; Virtual organization; Engineering; Technology; Grid computing",,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Tuecke, S., The Anatomy of the Grid: Enabling Scalable Virtual Organizations (2001) International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 15 (3), pp. 200-222. , August; Chin, J., Zhang, N., Nenadic, A., Bamasak, O., A context-constrained authorisation (cocoa) framework for pervasive grid computing Wireless Networks, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-008-0135-0, [Online].

It discusses the characteristics of classical authorization system and requirements of the authorization system in pervasive grid environment as well. Based on our analysis of current systems and taking into account the main requirements of such pervasive environment, we propose new authorization system architecture as an extension of the existing grid authorization mechanisms. This architecture not only supports user attributes but also context attributes which act as a key concept for context-awareness thought. The architecture allows authorization of users dynamically when there are changes in the pervasive grid environment. For this, we opt for hybrid authorization method that integrates push and pull mechanisms to combine the existing grid authorization attributes with dynamic context assertions. We will investigate the proposed architecture using a real testing environment that includes heterogeneous pervasive grid infrastructures mapped over multiple virtual organizations. Various scenarios are described in the last section of the article to strengthen the proposed mechanism with different facilities for the authorization procedure.","Authorization System; Contextawareness; Pervasive Grid; Ubiquity","Authorization procedure; Authorization systems; Context attributes; Context-Aware; Contextawareness; Current system; Dynamic contexts; Pervasive environments; Pervasive grid computing; Pervasive grids; Proposed architectures; Testing environment; Ubiquity; Virtual organization; Architecture; Grid computing",,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Tuecke, S., The Anatomy of the Grid: Enabling Scalable Virtual Organizations (2001) International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 15 (3), pp. 200-222. , August; Chin, J., Zhang, N., Nenadic, A., Bamasak, O., A context-constrained authorisation (cocoa) framework for pervasive grid computing Wireless Networks, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-008-0135-0, [Online].

However, extending the group work in this new environment remains an important challenge to provide humans with comfortable and adequate pervasive features. Consequently, a given solution would lead to a developed grid support for collaborative work and, thereafter, would conduce to successful supply of enough facilities to reach the real environment. Currently, available pervasive grid solutions do not provide plenty of support to such required environment due to sensing restrictions, classical grid limitations for enabling ubiquity devices as part of heterogeneous resources and diverse constraints on collaborative developments especially related to the scalability of groupware. The purpose of this work is to promote a platform tying together high performance of group-work environment, transparent grid infrastructure dedicated to ubiquitous computing and commodious brace of collaborative groupware and finally diverse frameworks of interactions: human-machine interactions, human-human mediated interactions and human-robot interactions. In this paper, we present eRoboRy platform, for: Collaborative Explorer Robots Platform for Remote Reality Discovery. It allows multiple robots, as intelligent devices, to operate collaboratively within a new structure of remote robot environment, which includes multiple operators as well. This research work undertakes to offer a new network of collaborative robots the ability to become thoroughly pervasive and to certify a large interactivity interfaces. This platform addresses the basic and new concept of PCRNet (Pervasive Collaborative Robot NETwork) based on PixRob (Pervasive mIXed reality environment of ROBot), as a remote environment of the deployed robots.","Collaborative work; Human-machine and human-robot interactions; Pervasive grid computing; Robotics and mobile robots; Telepresence","Collaborative development; Collaborative robots; Collaborative Work; Future trends; Grid infrastructures; Group work; Heterogeneous resources; Human -robot interactions; Human machine interaction; Human-machine; Intelligent devices; Interactivity; Mediated interaction; Mixed-reality environment; Multiple operator; Multiple robot; New structures; Pervasive grid computing; Pervasive grids; Real environments; Remote environment; Remote robot; Research areas; Telepresence; Work environments; Grid computing; Groupware; Human computer interaction; Information technology; Intelligent robots; Man machine systems; Mobile robots; Robotics; Ubiquitous computing; Virtual reality; Visual communication; Human robot interaction",,,,,,,"Waldron, K., Schmiedeler, J., Kinematics (2008) Springer Handbook of Robotics, pp. 9-33. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, ch.

Packet World Problem is MAS application used in this research to study the cooperation interaction between agents. This research aims to prove that using cooperative MAS algorithm will solve packet world problem in minimum number of steps, less time, and decrease network consumption. This will minimize processor and memory utilization. Packet World Problem is a case study used in literature to study MAS interactions and characteristics. It is an environment consists of multiple agents and packets, whereas they were distributed on different Grid machines. The main goal of this problem is cleaning the environment from packets. The proposed work includes Cooperative MAS model which consists of two levels, where each level has a specific sub-goal to achieve. Agents at both levels cooperate to achieve the global goal. In the same time the proposed work includes Cooperative MAS algorithm which solve Packet World Problem efficiently. Different scenarios were tested and the proposed algorithm gave results as enhancement of 84% less in number of steps, 40% less in consumed time and 72% less in network consumption. ©2009 IEEE.","Cooperation; Distributed systems; Grid; Multi-Agent System (MAS); Packet world problem","Distributed systems; E-Commerce; In-network; MAS applications; Memory utilization; Multiple agents; Subgoals; Transportation system; WEB application; Air traffic control; Algorithms; Digital television; Research; Multi agent systems",,,,,,,"Vlassis, N., (2007) A Concise Introduction to Multiagent Systems and Distributed Artificial Intelligence, , 1st ed., Morgan &amp; Claypool; Timm, I., Pawlaszczyk, D., Large Scale Multiagent Simulation on the Grid Proceedings of the Workshop on Agent-based Grid Economics (AGE 2005) at the IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGRID).

Each of the VO classes has different goals that hope to be achieved by providing policies. The main question in this regard is that ""how such policies can help the entire VO participants achieve their goals"". Approach: As a first step to address this question, we developed and evaluated a policy management framework within a specialized context, namely Utility based Policy Management System (U-PMS). We proposed an approach for policy federation, in which a group of VO participants agreed to adopt common standards to provide a common infrastructure that unifies the way the policies were applied in VO. Results: The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed approach was able to manage VO policies and achieve higher utility for VO participant through its management functions. It outperforms the related system by 9.99% for acceptance function and 5.77% for conflict resolution and 4.65% for policy merging. Conclusion: We observed that the utility of VO participants' can be improved through managing the applied polices in VO. © 2009 Science Publications.","Multi-attribute utility theory; Policy utility; Virtual organization management",,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., Tuecke, S., The anatomy of the grid: Enabling scalable virtual organizations (2001) Int.

In large-scale Grid, data replication provides a suitable solution for managing data files where data reliability and data availability are enhanced. Replica selection is one of the major functions of data replication that decides which replica location is the best for Grid users. In this paper, we address the replica selection problem in a Grid environment where the users are competing for the limited data resource. Thus, our aim is to establish fairness among the users in the selection decisions. Since the criteria that play a role in the selection process conflict with each other and produce heterogeneous values, the Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to solve this optimization problem. The proposed system validity and performance are evaluated by using a simulation. The simulation results were produced and discussed in this paper. © 2009 IEEE.","Analytical hierarchy process; Data grid; Fairness; Replica optimization service","Analytical hierarchy process; Data availability; Data files; Data grid; Data reliability; Data replication; Fairness; Grid environments; Grid users; Limited data; Optimization problems; Replica location; Replica optimization service; Scientific applications; Selection decisions; Selection problems; Selection process; Simulation result; Suitable solutions; Wide area; Large scale systems; Optimization",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Croatia","Chan Huah Yong is a senior lecturer in the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).

The grid services are designed to support a variety of data grid applications (jobs) and projects. Replica selection is a high-level service that chooses a replica location from among many distributed replicas with the minimum response time for the users' jobs. Estimating the response time accurately in the grid environment is not an easy task. The current systems expose high response time in selecting the required replicas because the response time is estimated by considering the data transfer time only. Approach: We proposed a replica selection system that selects the best replica location for the users' running jobs in a minimum response time that can be estimated by considering new factors besides the data transfer time, namely, the storage access latency and the replica requests that waiting in the storage queue. Results: The performance of the proposed system was compared with a similar system that exists in the literature namely, SimpleOptimiser. The simulation results demonstrated that our system performed better than the SimpleOptimiser on an average of 6%. Conclusions: The proposed system can select the best replica location in a lesser response time than the SimpleOptimise. The efficiency of the proposed system is 6% higher than the SimpleOptimise. The efficiency level has a high impact on the quality of service that is perceived by grid users in a data grid environment where the data files are relatively big. For example, the data files produced from the scientific applications are of the size hundreds of Terabytes. © 2008 Science Publication.","Data grid; Replica selection decision; Response time estimation",,,,,,,,"Zhou, X.L., Kim, E., Kim, J.W., Yeom, H.Y., ReCon: A fast and reliable replica retrieval service for the data grid (2006) Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGRID'06), 1, pp. 446-453. , May 16-19, IEEE Computer Society Press, LOS ALAMITOS, USA, Doi: 10.1109/CCGRID.2006.83; William H.

It is one of the data mining techniques is an unsupervised learning. In a grid environment, the number of computing nodes and users may reach up to thousands or millions. The grid is said to be dynamic in that the behaviors and values of these resources change all the time. Hence, these data are not suitable to be processed in an off-line mode. The existing clustering techniques today however emphasize more on the data's behaviors categorization but not the data's stability. Furthermore, the normal clustering techniques are more suitable to be used for static data type in an off-line mode. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an Evolving Clustering (Evoc Algorithm) which is an improved version of Evolving Clustering Method (ECM). We apply both methods on CPU usage to identify computers behaviors. The algorithm has been evaluated using three main criteria; that is dynamicity, accuracy and the ability to identify the stable cluster members. Our results show the improvements of the algorithm to process the data in an on-line mode in the evaluation of the algorithm's dynamicity and accuracy criteria compare to other existing clustering techniques. Furthermore, the stability evaluation was a success where we were able to identify the stable cluster members from the filtered stable clusters. However, the result was highly affected by three factors namely threshold value, stability value and stability hour.","Clustering; Data stability; Evolving clustering (Evoc); Evolving clustering method (ECM); Grid",,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Kesselman, C., (1998) The Grid: Blueprint for the New Computing Infrastructure, , Morgan Kaufman Publishers, Inc; Chen, M.S., Han, J., Yu, P.S., Data Mining: An Overview from database perspective (1996) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Eng., pp. 866-883; Jain, A.K., Murty, M.N., Flynn, P.J., Data Clustering: A Review (1999) ACM Computing Surveys, 31 (3), pp. 264-323. , Sept; Dinda, P.A., The Statistical Properties of Host Load (1998) Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Languages, Compilers; Guha, S., Rastogi, R., Shim, K., CURE: An efficient clustering algorithm for large databases (1998) Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 73-84. , New York; Karypis, G., Han, E.-H., Kumar, V., CHAMELEON: A hierarchical clustering algorithm using dynamic modeling (1999) COMPUTER, p. 32. , 68-75; Kaufman, L., Rousseeuw, P.J., (1990) Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis, , John Wiley and Sons; Jain, A.K., Dubes, R.C., (1988) Algorithms for Clustering Data, , Prentice Hall; Ng, R.T., Han, J., Member, IEEE Computer Society, CLARANS: A Method for Clustering Objects for Spatial Data Mining (2002) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 14 (5), pp. 1003-1016. , September/October; Heer, J., Chi, Ed.H., Mining the Structure of User Activity using Cluster Stability (2002) Proceedings of the Web Analytics Workshop, SIAM Conference on Data Mining; Ben-Hur, A., Elisseff, A., Guyon, I., A Stability Based Method for Discovering Structure in Clustered Data (2002) Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB2002), , Kaua'I, HI, January; Song, Q., Kasabov, N., Dynamic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS): On-line Learning and Application for Time-Series Prediction (2000) Proc. 6th International Conference on Soft Computing, pp. 696-701. , Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan; Kasabov, N., Song, Q., DENFIS: Dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system and its application for time-series prediction (2002) Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions, 10 (2), pp. 144-154. , April; Yaik, O.B., Yong, C.H., Haron, F., CPU Usage Pattern Discovery Using Suffix Tree. 2nd International Conference on Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Applications (2006) Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Application 2006, pp. 14-21. , IEEE.

One of the grid computing purposes is to share computational resources. The efficiency and effectiveness of resource utilization of a grid greatly depend on the scheduler algorithm. The scheduler will be able to manage the grid resources more effectively if we able to predict and provide it with the future state of grid resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a model to perform time series prediction using adaptive association rules. This model uses the idea that if a segment of a repeatable time series pattern has occurred, it has the possibility that the following segments of the repeatable pattern will appear. Data mining and pattern matching techniques are being applied to mine for repeatable time series patterns. This model has the ability to provide confident level for each prediction it made and perform continuous adaptation. A prototype of this model is being developed and tested with four test cases. These test cases are relatively simple because our work on this time series prediction using adaptive association rules is very much in its early stages. The result from the experiment shows that our model is able to capture repetitive time series patterns and perform prediction using those patterns. However, this model has some drawbacks such as it required high computational power and required large storage.",,"Adaptive association rules; Distributed systems; Grid computing; Schedular algorithms; Adaptive algorithms; Computational complexity; Data mining; Data recording; Mathematical models; Time series analysis; Distributed computer systems",,,,,,,"Koskela, T., Varsta, M., Heikkonen, J., Kaski, K., Time series prediction using recurrent SOM with local linear models (1997) Research Report, B15. , Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Computational Engineering, Finland.

Experimental evaluations on real world data collected from the web shows that our classification algorithm gives promising results and can potentially be used to classify search results returned by search engines. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.","Feature selection; Information retrieval; Results classification; Self-customized categories","Feature extraction; Information retrieval; Search engines; Text processing; Classification algorithm; Experimental evaluation; Feature selection methods; On-line information; Results classifications; Self-customized categories; Text classification; Web search results; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,"Liu, C., A Survey: Automatic Text Categorization (2004) CS412 Report, , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Joachims, T., A Probabilistic Analysis of the Rocchio Algorithm with TFIDF for Text Categorization (1997) In Proceedings of the 14' International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML97), pp. 143-151; Chen, H., Dumais, S.T., Bringing Order to the Web: Automatically Categorizing Search Results (2000) In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2000), pp. 145-152; Chen, H.S., Dumais, T., Cytrell, E., Optimizing Search by Showing Results in Context (2001) In Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2001), pp. 277-284; Liu, H.H.D., Motoda, H., Consistency Based Feature Selection (2000) Proceedings of the Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-2000), , In; Mladenic, D., Grobelnik, M., Word sequences as features in text-learning (1998) In Proceedings of ERK-98, the seventh Electro-technical and Computer Science Conference, pp. 145-148; Sahami, M., Koller, D., Toward Optimal Feature Selection (1996) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML96), pp. 284-292. , In, San Franscisco CA, Morgan Kaufmann; Salton, G., Buckley, C., (1988) Term Weighting Approaches in Automatic Text Retrieval, , In Technical Report, COR-87-881, Department of Computer Science, Cornell University; Tan, S.S., (2002) Topic Hierarchy Annotation using Feature Selection Technique, , MSc Thesis, School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia",,,"Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence;IFIP TC12/WG12.3;The China Computer Federation","Springer New York LLC","IFIP TC12/WG12.3 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, IIP 2004","21 October 2004 through 23 October 2004","Beijing",105755,18684238,038723151X; 9780387231518,,,"English","IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902515017

This paper describes a rank aggregation model that incorporates text analysis measure with existing rankbased method, e.g. Best Rank and Borda Rank, to aggregate search results from various search systems. This approach provides means to normalize the differences of rank methodology used by different search systems, justifying the potential of using contents analysis to improve the results relevancy in meta search. In this paper, we fully describe our approach on text normalization for meta search and present our rationality of using two rankbased methods in our model. We then evaluate and benchmark the performance of our model based on user judgment on results relevancy. Our experiment results show that when text analysis factor is taken into account, the results outperform the rank-based methods alone. This shows the potential of our model to complement current rank aggregation methods used in meta search. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.","Information retrieval; Meta search; Normalization; Ranking; Search results aggregation","Benchmarking; Information retrieval; Meta search; Model-based OPC; Normalization; Problem domain; Rank aggregation; Ranking; Text analysis; Text normalizations; Safety devices",,,,,,,"Jansen, B.J., The effect of query complexity on Web searching results (2000) Information Research, 6 (1); Jansen, B.J., Spink, A., Saracevic, T., Real life, real users, and real needs: A study and analysis of user queries on the web (2000) Information Processing and Management, 36 (2), pp. 207-227. , Elsevier; Ricardo, B.Y., Berthier, R.N., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , ACM Press Series/Addison-Wesley, New York; Dwork, C., Kumar, R., Naor, M., Sivakumar, D., Rank Aggregation Methods for the Web (2001) WWWIO, , ACM, Hong Kong; Harman, D., The Development and Evolution of TREC and DUC (2003) NTCIR Workshop; Sullivan, D., (2003) Search Engine Watch: Major Search Engines and Directories, , http://searchenginewatch.eom/links/article.php/2156221/; Voorhess, E.M., The Philosophy of Information Retrieval Evaluation (2001) 2nd Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, CLEF 2001, pp. 355-370. , Darmstadt, Germany; Aslam, J.A., Montague, M., Model for Metasearch (2001) SIGIR'Ol, pp. 276-284. , ACM, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Renda, M.E., Straccia, U., Web Metasearch: Rank vs. Score Based Rank Aggregation Methods (2003) SAC2003, , ACM, Melbourne, Florida, USA; Mahabhashyam, M.S., Singitham, P., (2002) Tadpole: A Meta search engine, , CS276A Report, Standford",,,"Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence;IFIP TC12/WG12.3;The China Computer Federation","Springer New York LLC","IFIP TC12/WG12.3 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, IIP 2004","21 October 2004 through 23 October 2004","Beijing",105755,18684238,038723151X; 9780387231518,,,"English","IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902472994

It provides an opportunity to harness a lot of idle peer-resources such as desktop computers across the Internet, for solving large-scale computing applications. Each peer is autonomous and it needs incentive for sustained contribution of its resources to P2P applications. In addition, a flexible and efficient job scheduling is needed to harvest the idle computing power as cheaply and economically as possible. This paper introduces an economic based job scheduler for mapping jobs to resources in P2P computing environment. The scheduler has been implemented with the Compute Power Market (CPM) system developed using Sun JXTA P2P technology. Our scheduler can be configured depending on users' quality of service requirements such as the deadline and budget constraints. Our scheduler follows a hierarchy scheme. The design allows multiple consumers and multiple providers to schedule and run jobs. To allow wider support for a wide variety of applications, the system is designed to allow easy 'plug in' of user applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,"Budget control; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Personal computers; Quality of service; Scheduling; Social networking (online); Budget constraint; Computing power; Large-scale computing; P2P applications; P2P technologies; Peer-to-peer computing; Peer-to-peer computing systems; Web based computing; Peer to peer networks",,,,,,,"Shikey, C., What is P2P⋯ And What Isn't (2000), http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/11/24/shirky1-whatisp2p.html, O'Reilly Network.

For this purpose we have reviewed the mobile agent technology and their advantages. As a result, a mobile agent-based solution is proposed. This fault recovery service has four main components, namely Fault Detector, Agent Manager, Agents Repository and Recovery Agents. Each component has its distinct role, such as detecting fault, managing agents activities, store all recovery agents, diagnose the causes of fault and recover from them.
