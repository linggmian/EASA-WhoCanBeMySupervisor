# EASA-WhoCanBeMySupervisor
 
This project, “Expert Search & Analysis – Who Can Be My Supervisor” aims to provide postgraduate students with a search tool to find their desired supervisor based on their desired topic to be researched upon. This project performs expert search that consists of query processing that can identify a suitable supervisor based on their published works. The system would be able to accept inputs such as the keyword and title of the project. The system would perform query processing to search for the similar publications that matches with the user query input. The system would be developed in a web environment and be easily accessible by research students using web browsers. This project can help students understand better about their potential supervisors and assist them in making a better decision about selection of supervisor.
